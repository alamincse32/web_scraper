I have already returned online outfits, especially pants. The size chart of online clothing is Not always accurate. So tonight I continue to online shop and order clothes. My retail job kind of has a uniform. I  wear scrub pants and we have an assigned polo shirt. My teaching job is the 1 that I am finding myself doing online shopping for. I have tons of tops in my closet. I am donating a bunch of my favorite dresses that I had never worn, but had saved as they were so lovely. Now I feel bad but hope that some lady will be able to appreciate my dresses. Tonight I am feeling anxious. I have not worked for 2 days in a row. Tomorrow and next day I work both jobs. I need to go take my pm Rx's or I shall never chill and will feel jittery all night. Take care everyone, and take 1 day at a time.","Hi 2Healthy4Me,
I'm so glad I came across your post sharing about the incredible difficulty in finding professional pants. I also have plenty of tops, but otherwise only jeans and capri leggings that are really comfortable. I have been out of work for 2-1/2 years and trying to find pants that truly fit, are a material my skin can tolerate, and are reasonably priced, has been overwhelming, and no success yet. The shame and unhappiness I feel about how my body carries extra weight and how that makes finding any pants that comfortably fit almost impossible is often overwhelming. When I did find a pair a while back, having them tailored to fit ended up being more expensive then the pants.
Yikes! I sure am venting here. I'm grateful to have found this site. Thank you for sharing.","Macy's has a plus women's department. The In Style Department has a line of soft stretchy jeans. This line of women's jeans are called, ""In Style."" I ordered a larger size but ended up overjoyed by the generosity of how stretchy the material fits. Now I may even fit in a size less. I hope that you explore some online shopping sites for plus size clothing. Just use their brands size chart and measure yourself for filling in the measurement blanks.It's fun shopping, beats staying home and eating...",,,,,,,,,

A diagnosis is very validating, but unfortunately it doesn’t do anything. At least in my experience.

6,10/20/2021,Ifeeltrappedanddon'tknowhowtostop,"I have an eating disorder. I have always had body dysmorphia and have had bad thoughts about eating since I was young, but I was able to pretty much push those thoughts aside and maintain a normal eating lifestyle. It wasn't until sophomore year when I dropped a significant amount of weight (due to stressful situations) that my mindset changed. At first when I lost the weight I knew it was unhealthy so the summer after my sophomore year I worked on rebuilding my body and I ate normally and enjoyed exercising. That summer I had the healthiest relationship with food and my body, and it has been the last time I have ever had a healthy relationship with food. That was the summer of 2019. When returning to school, I was healthy at first, but then I had the constant desire to lose weight and be skinnier than all my friends. So I heavily restricted almost all foods and again I lost a vast amount of weight. I kept on my restriction until quarantine. When quarantine hit I told myself that it'd be really hard to restrict myself without going to school and being at home all day. During quarantine I would severely restrict myself and then binge and repeat. I am still stuck in the loop of restriction and binging and I want to change my brain so bad. I know that binging comes from restriction, but even when I'm not restricting my brain wants me to keep eating until I'm sick. I am just confused and looking for advice on how to change my mindset and lifestyle because my eating disorder has brainwashed me and has become a habit. If anyone has any helpful tips I would be more than happy to hear them.",,,,,,,,,,,

11,10/09/2021,Simplemealideas?,"This is my first time posting on a forum like this, I'm really nervous to submit this but I'd really appreciate some help or feedback or even some kind words.I struggled with bulimia for a couple years in college. It started with dieting and counting calories until it progressed to throwing up almost all day long, everyday. I was always hungry and the only thing I could think about was what food I was going to eat next and how I would purge. I tried stopping at various times, but could never quite fully pull myself out of the hole I dug around me. I dated a few guys in that time and each time they found out, they were really angry with me and the relationship would end shortly after. I felt like a ticking time bomb.One day I started dating the guy of my dreams, a guy I had a crush on since I was 14 and it turned out he liked me the whole time too. I decided to fully quit bulimia. Of course I had some slip-ups in the first week of trying, but eventually I stopped puking. I had to learn how to eat fast and sugary food again without feeling sick. I had to learn how much food was a normal amount because I hadn't felt full in years. The first time I felt full and let myself digest my food I cried because it had been so long since I felt 'normal'.I started recovery on my own, but after I felt confident eating and digesting food I eventually told my boyfriend and he was perfectly wonderful about it. I had to teach him my needs, but he never made me feel bad. By the way, he lives in Massachusetts and I live in Texas. He FaceTimed me for every meal and told me I was beautiful and perfect every single time I started worrying about my weight.Over the summer I got a job in Massachusetts and lived with him in a tiny room in a house he shared with 4 guys. It was hard at first and there was even a time I almost gave up because he didn't understand I needed to eat at the same time everyday because otherwise I wouldn't eat at all. We talked it out and developed a plan. It ended up working out and I got used to living with the perfect, most loving, caring person.Summer ended and I had to go back to Texas for my last semester of college. I'm doing well in my classes because I don't skip and I always get my work done, but I'm struggling with eating again. For some reason almost all food looks gross to me. I don't think I'm eating nearly as much as I should be even though I'm really trying. I was really happy with my weight, but now I'm almost back to my high school weigh. I've never really struggled with anorexia before, but that seems to be my new problem. I'm not sure if it's because I'm sad from missing my boyfriend or scared of food because of my past relationship with it, but something's definitely wrong. I used to always be hungry and now I never am. Yesterday I felt sick while sitting at my computer, so I stood up and my vision went black at the edges. I crumpled to the floor and dropped everything in my hands and waited on the floor in the fetus position for the feeling to go away. I ended up taking a nap and ordering food for dinner and then sleeping very early. I feel alright now, but a little shaken. I think I'll feel better if I get back into a routine of eating at the same times everyday, but I've never been a very good cook and usually just ate microwavable meals. The problem is that type of food just looks gross to me now. I was hoping some of you might have some simple, fresh meal ideas for a recovering bulimic/possible anorexic that I could make easily. The less complex the better. Thank you for reading, sorry it's long.","Hi braviary18, welcome to the forums. We are glad that you reached out for some advice and support.

16,10/07/2021,Ireallyneedhelp..,"Hey guys...
I am a 47 year old anorexic woman. I had anorexia in my teens, which I had to be hospitalized for. I am normal height and I got down to a very low weight. At age 17, I got help and started recovery. I was under the assumption that I had fully recovered because I was able to eat intuitively throughout most of my adult life. But there were a few periods where I fell back into anorexic behavior, so my trajectory should not be too surprising.
2 years ago I got out of an abusive marriage. Like many people who suffer from eating disorders, I have experienced trauma. My parents were alcoholics, I was sexually and verbally abused and I have endured 3 divorces, not to mention the 6 divorces my mother went through while I was growing up. Stability was in limited supply and, put mildly, I have been through hell.
So, after the domestic violence incident in 2019, I spiraled back down into anorexia. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to find my way back out of it. I have a daughter, so I worry what influence this might have on her. I am currently receiving counseling but can't seem to stop. I count calories obsessively, overexercise, cut up my food, consume caffeine all day... you guys know how it goes. But I am angry at myself because, while I know that what I am doing is harmful and desperately want to stop...I just can't seem to.
I need help. This is impacting my ability to function. The only part of my life that seems to be thriving is my family life (for which I am grateful), but I wonder what affect this is having on them?
Incidentally, I am a very thin (but not dangerously underweight) woman, so no one outside of my family or therapist would suspect I struggle with this. Truth be told, I am of two minds. On an emotional level, being thin is satisfying. Note the word FEEL. It makes me FEEL attractive and FEEL like my life is in control. However, I KNOW (logically) that the feelings of control are an illusion, I KNOW that I am probably more attractive when my skin has color and I'm healthy and I KNOW that this is destroying me from the inside out. So, if I know this, why can't I stop?! This obsessive cycle comes at the cost of hurting my family, not to mention MYSELF. I always feel cold, I've lost so much hair, I am unable to sleep or concentrate and I'm destroying my body from the inside out. No one should feel happy when they see their ribs and chest bones! This is really difficult. I want to have my life back. I miss eating food and feeling FREE and happy.","Welcome to the forums! It's great that you have the courage to share your story!

Once, I heard a therapist saying that full recovery from eating disorders is possible. Like we all can recover from a cold or a broken leg. However, we can experience a cold or break another leg later in our life.Anorexia seems to be back to your life but it may be just a lapse. You already overcame it once and I am sure you will overcome it again. You are getting treatment, you are fed up of the illness, what is that you are still afraid of doing in order to get your life back?If you are fearful of eating or not working out, do it now. The more you challenge your ED, the sooner you will be able to get rid of it. I know it is not easy. I perfectly get it. I am 41 and have had all types of eating disorders. I have been fine sometimes and I have relapsed others. But each relapse has come with a lot of learnings. I know that the older I get, my body can tolerate less the side effects of my ED. I know that an ED can steal the joy of my life. I know that an ED can make me so depressed to feel like wanting to die.So, start challening your ED, NOW. Don't leave it for tomorrow. We have it always in our back pocket. We use it when life gets hard. But our experience has shown us that it is not the way out.I send you a big hug. Keep fighting!Annet",,,,,,,,,
17,10/06/2021,FeelingLikeIHaveNoControlOveraFewThings...........,"So my period's been irregularly late since July. My belly and upper torso just feel so bloated to me. I try and exercise but in spite of hydrating w/ plenty of water, eating carefully, and even praying.I just can't seem to get a grip on my body's rebelling against all the years of self discipline, and healthy lifestyle. I feel embarrassed to even go near friendswho hadn't seen me since CV-19 shelter began in 2020. I am feeling kind of euphoric over getting a better grip on my body getting straight,  and getting back into shape. I am taking 1 day off during my work week to catch up on everything that I can't do because,  I have returned to my 2 job routine as before, and ever shall be for me, AMEN..... work as a teacher,  once again. I miss Not being in 1 to 1 , onsite therapy,  at my doctor's office. It's all still done w/ Zoom check ins, ZOOM jobinterviews, Zoom board meetings, and other eye straining and neck muscle straining too.ughhh!!I just wanna Zoom away to a far away place, and ask The Great Wizard of Life to please helpme to get back to the way I was comfortable before. ALL this COVID, Covid, CV-19...took me out of the fast career whirlwind that I was stuck running in. felt like it froze me in 1 sheltered spot for almost 2 yrs of my hardly lived life of 35-Something+ years old,   and a few yrs + or - either way.I feel really sedated and slow, somehow controlled by something other than myself. I am a control freak so feeling like I am being controlled by something other than me is like being on a bad roller coaster ride that just won't end..... I am really tired of this crippling feeling. and need to get myself back up to AAU speed.I plan to take 1 step at a time. I have a new goal andit will take timeto accomplish.Take care everyone....",,,,,,,,,,,
18,09/18/2021,Depressedkid,How have you been doing lately?,I'm kind of mad. I felt like I was feeling better than in a long time and I felt like I had some sort of control again.. Then I decided to have fun with my friends and we went to a restaurant and everything was lovely. But today I just feel like I can't do anything fun anymore. I feel terrible about the amount of food I ate and the fact that I didn't exercise because I was with my friends.. This just takes too much energy.But that is how I'm doing right now.Please do also tell how you are doing? Tell if somethings on your mind but if everything is going well tell that also. It would be nice to hear something good.,"It's good hearing from you.   In regards to my eating disorder recovery,  I've been doing really well.

19,07/10/2021,MyOB-GYNexamleftmeinaBadSpaceyesterday..............,"Firstly, I went to see my OB-GYN yesterday. We discussed my fibroids. Good news is that they are smaller then when evaluated a few yrs ago. Then , of course, like every OB-GYN exam, which is always so intimidating to me. I Never have adjusted to this invasive type of annual exam.Good news is the Dr said that everything LOOKS OK but if begin having a severe period or painful abdominal that I must race to the ER where they may do a spring cleaning of my old lady parts and then that shall be the end of that problem once and 4 ALL.....The bad news is that I have gained a lot of weight since she saw me last. I felt Very Ashamed sitting naively and having this bad news thrust upon my ears and then my stomach began to tighten and I thought that I would race out to the nearest bathroom and purge. Secondly, it felt like my restricting ED was triggered all over again from the bearer of this scary, truthful news about my issue of having become overweight in the last few yrs since she had seen me last.I last saw her when I was at the ER for severe pain in my stomach. My med chart states that I actually had a diverticulitis flare up and was internally toxic. I felt so bad, the EMT had to remove my IV so I could run and throw up in the nearest bathroom. This rude woman blocked my entrance to the toilet and held a plastic bag for me to throw up into. I couldn't speak OBVIOUSLY-duh, so I had to go around her rude road block. It actually felt like such a relief to rid myself of these acute toxins from my belly. That day was the 1st time the OB-GYN came in to discuss my other problem currently haunting my womanly organs. Well, I am just a little more aware of my weight as I have now heard the real news that I have gained a new pet donkey, and lost my feeling of self control and this feels scary to me. Lastly, I am actually feeling more goal oriented to be careful of what I place into my mouth  and I'm sure I will be relapsing into a full fledged case of restricting behavior. I'm sure I will feel much better when the local pools re-open, and when I find a gym to tone and sculpt my muscles which were in great form just a year and a half ago.Oh well for now. The bitter Truth is Not sweet 4 me. The truth about my Covid weight gain feels like a fulcrum in my attempt to get healthy. Once I get the Go Ahead from the recreational facilities in my local area, I will be exercising once again.I hope that you all are working on your plans for achieving a healthier YOU and keep up the great work....","I am sorry to hear about your health problems. However, it is good that the doctor found you well.
I do hate going to any type of doctor but the ob-gyn is the one I fear the most.
Please do not get frustrated due to your current weight. Life is too short to live by being slaves of what we eat or how much we work out. The best here is to live your life, create your own memories and to send our ED to the back seat. Whatever weight you may have that is more than your ""healthy weight"" will eventually go once you resume your normal activities. Please avoid going into restriction because we all know, we do not get anything good from it.Hugs

20,09/28/2021,MyBodyImageisFragileasIContinuetoRetainExtraWater,"I have not a clue about what the heck is going on with my body. I am still dealing with uncomfortable water retention. Around my right ankle, on the side, my foot looks puffy. My stomach area is so uncomfortable filled with water retention. My walking shoes are all fitting tightly. I have been taking walks w/ my summer sandals on nightly. I feel like I have lost my firm grip and have given in to feeling weak over all this water retention and continuous weight gain. I had to order bras in a size larger to fit my chest comfortably as the water retention is the greatest around the front of my chest, and back area too. This is not a crisis issue but more like a sense of loss of control over my well toned body that was accustomed to working out moderately almost daily at the pool or gym. So because walking is my last resort, and my feet are not fitting in my sneakers so well anymore I feel defeated by this awful water retention. My gynecologists' said the ovarian fibroids are large but should not be causing water retention or obvious weight gain. I am fasting more as a result of feeling helpless over my body's weight gain and water retention. I have placed my old herbal diet remedy back on my order list and am about to begin using this as soon as it is shipped to me. I cant walk any faster than my legs will allow me to.

My doctor has stated that at this point in my illness, it would be best for me to seek inpatient treatment. However, I am self employed (I teach piano) and if I take 3-4 weeks, I don't get paid. On top of that, my husband makes very little. We can only just afford bills as it is. I'm exploring intensive outpatient as an option as well, but even that would interrupt my schedule for teaching.

23,09/23/2021,Doubtingdiagnosisinextremehunger,"Hi everyone! First of all, this is my first post, so I'm not really sure how to put this. I was diagnosed with anorexia this year, and have suffered similar episodes in the past. This relapse was by far the worst, and I am now trying to recover. As soon as I started to increase my meal plan with my dietitians recommendations, I started experiencing extreme hunger. I try to honor the hunger and eat more, but when I do this, a voice in my head tells me that because I am ""giving in"" to extreme hunger, I can't really have an ED, and that the diagnosis must be false. I am not sure if this makes sense... Does anyone else feel this way? Of course, I KNOW that starting recovery doesn't mean I was never sick, but I feel like I'm ""giving in"" to this hunger too easily. I'm just looking for support or anyone else who has experienced similar feelings...","I was there about 9 months ago. I was forced into recovery in a way, but there was no one holding me accountable. Despite that I ate a lot of food during extreme hunger with little compensation, so I gained all the weight back and then some. I felt like and still do sometimes, “maybe I wasn’t really anorexic, I was just exaggerating” because I wasn’t thin enough, I binged and purged during my anorexia instead of restriction and exercise. And I had people tell me I was definitely dealing with an eating disorder, but I never got a professional diagnosis, so I continued to doubt myself. Af the end of the day, I know you have heard it 1000 times before, the severity has nothing to do with anything physical, if it causes you stress or pain or whatever, it deserves to be healed. I spent months trying to go back to the original behaviors, but I never could maintain it, and I hated myself because if it was so effortless to eat again, then I never was sick. Over time, this feeling has faded for me, mostly because it’s just useless to keep ruminating and it stresses me out. The best things I can recommend is literally just validating yourself. I would’ve thought that is SO STUPID, but you hear something enough like “you are sick enough and you deserve help” you eventually start to listen. Now, 8 months later, I’m starting to return to a normal life with regular eating and normal people things like college and jobs. So I guess it does get better :)",Thank you for your wonderfully kind response :) it makes me feel a lot better knowing that someone else has gone through something similar and that it does get better... I really appreciate your reply and resonate with what you've said. thank you :),,,,,,,,,
24,08/15/2021,BeforeDinnerTime,"Hi,
I'm currently trying to recover from my eating disorder.
One thing that has really been upsetting me lately is before dinner. Just like what happened today. I was cooking with my mom, and I just felt so stressed, pressured, and overwhelmed as we made all the food. There was so much everywhere. I wasn't dizzy, but it was like everything was whirling around me and I ended up breaking down because it was all too much. Not all days are like this, but it seems to be a trend.
This is why I am wondering if anyone has ideas on how to make this part less stressful. What do you do when making the food is difficult? Do you just push through it like a semi truck or distract yourself by watching Mr.Bean? I don't know but please share any ideas.
Thank you.","Cooking can be stressful and I also feel overwhelmed depending on what I make. I found that if I try to prep as much before cooking, like pre measuring ingredients, or if I make a side or appetizer to go with the meal, I'll make it before I even start cooking. I find that it makes cooking easier and more enjoyable and doesn't feel as stressful or frustrating. Also when I feel like when I'm cooking and it's getting away from me, I ask my mom to help out, so maybe you could let your mom take control and see what you can do to help her out so it's not as overwhelming",,,,,,,,,,

26,09/11/2021,ReallyWorriedovermyWeightGainafterCovidRecess.....,"I am still gaining weight. I have never felt this way before.I eat regularly, within moderation, and exercise 4 x a week or so. Everything I do is in Moderation. After I took a tumble down my apt stairs about 8 months ago, my body has had achy thighs, pelvic bones, and now swelling in my ankle area. I did freak out and have been taking OTC water pills to help w/ this foot problem.I cant even wear normal footwear to my retail job currently from this swollen foot.I only eat X meals a day and X snacks as well.Nothing is snacked on that would even cause me to gain weight, sometimes 1 Lb. a day.I have donated all my gently used jeans, and other dresses, some which I was planning to wear when I fit into them as they were just a tad tight on me.I had to order new dresses, exercise pants, tops for work, etc.I am frustrated over these changes in my body weight and size. Still waiting for the town pool to re-open. Still only walk a few blocks per nights off from work, as my thigh and foot problem are painful currently.I buy clothes but keep wearing this 1 type of summer shorts and gym tops. When I do take eve walks I feel angry that I am only able to walk for exercise currently. I am grateful to God for what I do have, and all my working body parts, but still hard to accept the changes to my body currently.","I am sorry to hear about your health and weight struggles. Often, I feel like you.  I often ask myself: ""Why if I am doing all the right things, I am feeling worse?I do not have an answer. What I think is happening is that even though we are finding a balance in our lives (food/exercise-wise), we are unable to avoid our body complaining for so many years living an ED-life.Also, we are not 15, anymore. Besides all the damage we have done to our muscles and joints, for sure some other aches come from aging and recent injuries.In your particular case, I think your weight increase comes from your water retention problem. Please talk to a doctor and also tell him about your body aches. Sometimes, water retention causes everything to hurt. Also, you fell down from the stairs. Please ensure everything is okay.The other day, one of my Uni counsellors replied back to an email I sent him (he is retired, already). He said: ""The more that I age, the more that I learn just to observe and feel"".I am hyperactive, I suffer a lot when I can not practice my favorite exercise. But at the same time, I think of what may happen when I am old or disabled... Maybe, I will learn to observe and feel...It is just another way of living life (besides doing/moving our body).Hugs

You do not need to eat the entire cake or your full meal.

31,09/13/2021,I'veneverthoughtaboutrecoverybefore,"I feel like instead of working towards recovery, I've just settled on learning how to manage my disordered eating. Since middle school and being introduced to the food pyramid and food tracking, it was a downhill spiral from there and I started purging  + severely restricting what I ate. That was over 8 years ago, and now I've stopped purging (and I have gotten over some of my fear foods!), but I still can't stop myself for having these destructive thoughts about eating/me deserving to eat that cause me to just completely throw out a meal in the middle of cooking it or cry over the fact that I bought one type of food instead of another. I acknowledge that I use restriction as a way of harm towards myself as well. I've been to therapy before about anxiety and other issues, but I never fully brought up my ED because I thought ""I need to get through my other problems first"" or because the therapists I've been to specialize in something else I was struggling with. I've also had super bad experiences with therapists lately where they seem frustrated with me, so I'm scared for a bit.The only reason I bring all this up now is because I know that my friend has been struggling with their body image, and I have no idea how to comfort them or the right things to say and I'm scared about making things worse or watching them spiral into an ED. I've talked about body neutrality with them, but I don't think that's helpful. I'm even scared just to tell them fully that I've struggle with an ED because I know for me, competition is a big driver (ex: ""they didn't eat today, so I shouldn't"") and I don't want to trigger them in anyway or shift focus away from them in any way.

I've seen people say ""I don't want to shrink myself"" or ""I want to live my life"" and I want to feel like that but I don't. Did something change for them? or are they just faking it to make it?Long version: I have no idea how to WANT to recover. My family has pushed/forced me in the past, but ultimately I ignore them. People have told me that I have an eating disorder, but I stay seeking validation, looking for ""sick enough"". I don't want to burden the people around me with the bullshit that comes along with EDs, but I'd still rather be dying than recovering. I want to want to be better. I don't know how to recover with so little motivation or self-esteem (but not none). I don't have hopes or dreams to come back to, I don't want to face life without my eating disorder. Currently I'm using excuses. I'm not severely restricting like I was, it's not that bad, it's under control, it's just dieting, etc etc etc etc etc. I keep saying I am just fine with living with an eating disorder for the rest of my life, that nobody will be able to help because I don't even want to help myself. But a teeny, tiny part of me knows that long-term EDs are not ideal. They are the opposite of ideal. I don't want to be sick but it's the easiest thing I know. Additionally, a little bit unrelated, I was diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder a little while ago, and knowing it commonly co-occurs with eating disorders, I wanted to start a discussion. I feel like if I give up an eating disorder, I'll have to adopt a new self-destructive habit like alcohol abuse. It's like I don't know how to cope with my own life. If anyone has any advice or comments, I would so appreciate it!! Anything to feel a little less lost.","Hi, thank you for posting and we hope you get the support you deserve. You had mentioned some concerning language in your post so we would just like to pass along some resources you can reach out to: 
Please take care. ","ED's always come with a lot of ambiguity. I think it is normal to have periods of time when we are motivated to recover and some others when we are not. I still believe that I can be recovered and still keep my anorexic figure. I know that is not possible but I like to think it could be real.Long time ago, I felt like you. At some point, I stopped all treatment and said: ""If I can not stop my ED, I will stop fighting with it"" and decided to keep an eating-disordered life.To my surprise, reducing the focus on my ED helped me to be more flexible and natural with regards to my eating, exercise and body perception.I was cronically ill but I was functional... UNTIL I got tired of being pseudo-recovered and gave full recovery another try.That is where I am. I know sometimes it is not our moment to recover. Sometimes, we need to fake it until we make it. But there is a point in our lives when we realize the damage we are doing to our body and to our own life. Then, the desire to change comes.The only thing I will say is that ED's limit our lives. They make us live in a little box. We miss a lot of experiences and social interactions.If we want to live life fully, we can choose to be fine (or at least, the best that we can).Cheers
Annet","I really appreciate your input. Right now, I'm in a spot where I've pretty much given up on therapy and treatment, but like you said, not trying to solve the problems at the very least takes them out of the spotlight. I want to restrict, I want to purge or use laxatives, I want to be full in disordered, but I am not acting on it, simply because I'm not? It's like I'm too lazy for recovery, but too lazy for an eating disorder too. I know the eating disorder limits my life, but like I told my therapist a while ago, it's not my main concern. The anxiety limits my life, the depression limits my life, the obsessions limit my life, and it is all so overwhelming, I don't know where to start or how hard it will be so I don't even try recovery. Anyways, thank you!","I perfectly understand this: ""It's like I'm too lazy for recovery, but too lazy for an eating disorder too"". Often, I find myself there. It is like a ""limbo"" place but eventually, it helps.
When we are there, we may not recover but we may also not make things worse.Whatever you experiencing now will not last forever. I just want you to know that any depression, anxiety, darkness in your life shall pass. Stay strong and try to do things that make you feel happy.Hugs
Annet","I hope that you find somewhere deep within your body and spirit, a few good reasons to recover. Sure if people have no reason to behave because they have lost  trust and hope for a higher power like God, then they have lost hope in life. A quality life vr a life w/o meaning or reason. Don't you have friends to talk to and spend time with? When your family doesn't seem to be what you need than begin searching for your own reasons to live and be healthy.Good luck in your recovery. It's a process,  like accepting a loss. There are these phases of recovery:DenialAngerBargainingDepression     and Acceptance","Hi! I just wanted to add my two cents in here. I’ve been in your shoes and it sucks. I pseudo-recovered and now I’m back in ED hell. What I’ve been told before is that it doesn’t matter if you WANT to recover, just that you’re WILLING to take the steps necessary to start the recovery process. Im not sure you will ever hear someone with anorexia who says they want to gain weight and recover, but it’s important that they are willing to take that next step. Also, you made a comment that it isn’t that bad, that you’re not that sick. Again, this is a comment theme around eating disorders. We never feel as though we are sick enough to warrant treatment, that we could still handle losing a few more pounds, that our labs were mostly normal and we’re not in the ICU too sick to move, so that somehow gives our sick brains the green light to continue the self harm that comes along with an eating disorder. When someone brought it to my attention that I was engaging in self harm, it opened my eyes a lot. I don’t cut myself or anything like that, but I am doing damage to my body by depriving it of essential nutrients by restricting and/or purging. I too sometimes feel as though I am too lazy to continue in eating disordered behaviors, but also not motivated enough to recover. It’s difficult to find the energy to do anything when you are not fueling your body with what it needs. I don’t have the answers, but I do know that if you wait until you WANT recovery, it could be too late. Open up with your therapist about how you feel and your fears surrounding recovery. Tell them you are scared you might take up drinking or drugs to fill the void of the ED and they should be able to help you come up with some other coping skills to fill that void. Good luck! You can do this!","This is where I compare ED to depression. If someone is too depressed to get help, it's because depression saps your motivation. ED works in a similar way. It's hard to be motivated to do something when you are lacking the energy to stay motivated! Just remember that motivation isn't everything. I don't like to clean my apartment. Sometimes I do, but most of the time I don't. And sometimes it reaches a point where I have to bust out the feather duster and vaccuum because you can't take it anymore! Other times, I have to badger myself. The end result is the same.
I think EDs are kind of like that. Don't punish yourself for not ""wanting"" to get better. You being on this forum proves that you do. Otherwise, you wouldn't reach out. You didn't want to, but you did it anyway.","Oh why can't I be addicted to something not destructive?! I've done a few of them, self-mutilation (recovered 2009), alcohol abuse (recovered 2012), gambling (recovered 2008), I feel like if I 100% give up the anorexia/bulimia then I'm going to spin out of control and revert to old habits or pick up new ones. Bottom line is I'm constantly trying to find an escape from me, my depression and anxiety and inability to live instead of just exist. All I can say with certainty is recovery 15 years ago would have been a lot easier to start and commit to than it is now. The health repercussions have caught up to me. I am 'sick enough'. This is killing me. And that ED voice is still playing the same mind control game. ""Don't recover yet..."" Ultimately, waiting any longer is only going to lead to one thing.","Hi EphWhyEye, we are sorry to hear about what’s been going on.

I remember the apathy. I remember part of me wanting to get better, but another part of me thinking it's more important to be skinny and we'll die if we aren't skinny. There was never a perfect number because I was always lowering it. In terms of Borderline. It is possible to become symptom free. Research shows that symptoms improve with age and the most effective treatment is DBT. One lady was a psychologist with Borderline personality disorder. Another lady did amazing work in eating disorder recovery after overcoming her own eating disorder.
I personally am sober in AA, have recovery from bulimia, and Borderline personality disorder and I'm a psychologist. I had recovery from the anorexia until I developed some very serious food allergies a few months ago, but I'm fighting to get it back. I believe change is possible. I'm definitely not who I was 6 years ago or even a year ago. Be a warrior.","Hi AdultingBoo! It's wonderful that you are sharing your story and offering support to others.

34,09/07/2021,starving/bingeonrepeat,"I'm trying my best, but I starve myself in the morning and at night, normally around 11pm or 12am, I binge so much I feel like throwing up. This was constant and now I'm slowly getting better. I've been  eating during the day to break my body's natural food clock and drinking more water to make myself feel full at night. Sometimes I break my routine to go back to old habits, I won't lie. I'm at the biggest I've ever been and as a high schooler I shouldn't be this size. My future career even told me to lose weight, so hopefully this can motivate me to do better and live better.

35,08/22/2021,PostpartumRelapse,"Hi all,
I just signed up because I recently relapsed and have been struggling with immense guilt and shame.  I am a 30 year old first time mother of a 7 month old.  I have been struggling with anorexia since I was in 4th grade and bullemia since undergrad.  This is my first relapse in over 10 years for bullemia and I am devastated.  I was sleep training my daughter last night but ran to throw up in the middle of it.  To say that I am beating myself up is an understatement.  I never want my daughter to go through this or feel the way I do.  I am supposed to be setting a good example for her and feel like I have already let her down.  I would love to have some support around this!  I am already in therapy but just feel like I need additional support from those who understand what I am going through.  Thank you!!Mamabear","My daughter is 7 years old. When she was 7 months old, I was in recovery. I've been all over the place since then, anorexic, bulimic, recovering, relapsing. I try to shield her from it all as much as possible. I have felt like I've failed her and my 1.5 year old son on so many occasions. My daughter has the words yours doesn't yet. She informs me often that I am the best mother ever. Somehow, even when we do wrong, we can do no wrong in our young children's eyes. Just keep taking positive steps and don't beat yourself up for the negative. That will just get you in a worse place.","Your story sounds so familiar to my own. I relapsed when my son was born and I got into unhealthy habits trying to loose the baby weight. I since got back on track and am pregnant again with my second. First trimester had me throwing up (unintentionally) after most meals. Onto second trimester and the nauseousness went away. But my urge to want to throw up after meals did not, and I have unfortunately been giving in on occasion. I keep saying ""this is it"" after every time it happens, but it seems not to be. I never thought this would be the example I am leading for my children and I want more than anything for it not to be.",,,,,,,,,
36,08/02/2021,strugglingw/nofamily/supportsystem,"Hello,
I truly appreciate the opportunity to be heard. I have had an eating disorder since age 14. I am now 27 with two young children. I was very very sick before I got pregnant with my first child. I had tried multiple eating disorder centers. even flying myself to other states because i didn't trust myself to stay. I'm a chronic bad patient, checking in and out depending on my emotions. It's so hard getting help as an adult, because when the eating disorder voice saying ""I don't want to be here"" kicks in, there's nothing to stop you from leaving treatment. I feel that most people have family support throughout their treatment. But I had no one pushing me to stay or get help. My fiance at the time watched my health decline and it got to the point where I knew no one was going to save me. I found a lovely counselor who specializes in eating disorders, I was able to get healthy. And almost immediately got pregnant once at a healthy weight.This is where I felt my eating disorder was ""cured""
when I was pregnant, I knew the babies health was too important to restrict. I finally had a good appetite, my pregnancy brain was protecting me from depression. I was looking forward to this new life.
Of course this was very naive. Now with my second child almost 2 years old. I'm falling back into old habits. using restricting as a coping skill to deal with the depression from lack of family support. my families Lack of concern about my health (mentally and physically). self destructing slowly and quietly. I was brought up in a family where you keep your problems quiet.
It makes me sad that this has happened before, and I still feel shame in asking for help. How could I be so selfish? why haven't I ""grown up"" yet?
I have panic attacks, extreme anxiety to the point I can't work. I've been denied disability, and I feel like caring for my children just isn't enough.
I'm currently in college, but still don't feel like i'm doing enough. What breaks my heart is my fear of losing control again. becoming so sick that I can't care for my children properly. I care about them more than I care about myself, which is probably part of the problem. my self worth has always been low. How do you get into recovery with noone supporting you? not even your significant other?
is it reasonable to expect him to help me when we're both dealing with working and caring for kids?
This was why I never succeeded in typical recovery centers. I don't want help from a rotating shift of strangers. I want people who actually care. but they just don't exist. its so depressing.how would I fit recovery into my busy mom schedule?
I'm afraid of the future after recovery, how am I going to wake up, get me and my kids ready and out the door, work an 8 hour shift, come home, cook dinner, get them ready for bed etc?
I've been in therapy for years but still feel I have no good coping skills. Nothing works for me.It all seems like too much. I love my children, but I feel like a horrible mother for having this problem.
I'm extremely resentful toward my family for making me feel like I need to suck it up and never complain.
I don't have the energy to do the things I want to do. I don't feel loved. I don't feel worthy of anything. I don't enjoy hobbies. My fear and obsession with food is consuming my life again. Id love to just have someone to talk to about this stuff, without judging or assuming I want attention (which is another fear i have about talking about it)Does anyone else feel like this? Am I the only adult who still feels like a child inside my body? forced to go through the motions but knowing everything might come crashing down at any moment.To whoever is reading this,
Thank you for thinking of me.

Many people will just say something along the lines, everything will be alright so I won't say that. what I can say is I can relate to you 200%. My family isn't the nicest they are very judgmental and gossip. Naturally I won't vent to them but lately I've been venting to my mom. I told her the real way I lost weight (not eating unfortunately), how long I've been like this for, and my concern. she then told me that she used to be anorexic and bulimic (found this out today). But again why didnt she tell me sooner instead of waiting for me to vent? These questions as much as they are good to ask we dont necessarily need the answer to them. my family as well lacks the concern for my health none of them come to see if im ok or how im doing. I have many siblings and none of them except a brother that I connected with from my fathers side who has been through worse than me. But the ones I actually grew up with my sisters dont ask me how im doing or if I wanna go out and just take a moment to vent about life. my mom doesn't do this either we talk text. so I definitely can relate to you, you are not alone.just like your husband my man doesn't push me to get help. I push him to get the help he needs and to take days off to rest as needed but why won't he return the favor or not technically a favor but why can't he care for me in the way we care for them? (another one of those annoying useless questions that just drag us down.) Ive been noticing my bones and joints hurting. I tell him my thoughts and then only thing I get is either im fine and healthy just like my doctor said or I should make an Appointment. boom end of conversation.I totally get the just everything you said I can't even pin point it anymore cause im also a college student with depression and severe anxiety that cause me to have panic attacks. I also feel like caring for my daughter isn't enough I feel like im just doing the bare minimum. I know how you feel about wanting someone who just cares so I care. I care about your health and your concerns as if they were my own. we can do this for ourselves and for our children I believe in us.","No one in my family really knows the struggles I go through with my Ed. In the past, they supported me but some of them never got it OR they just became like the ""food police"" to me.As an adult now, I have decided to battle this on my own. I know it would be lovely to have my family supporting me but from past experiences, I know they are not in the best position to do it. They have many other worries to think of (a sister with terrible OCD issues, a depressed mum, terrible fights at home, etc.). So, the least that I want is having them chasing me to eat, over-observing me, making my life harder or my making their lives harder.Family support is great when the system is a healthy one but when you have a toxic family, sometimes is better to do it alone.If you crave some support from your loved ones, go for it. You deserve it and I am sure they will be willing to give it to you. Just choose carefully. Please also think that we need to do this for ourselves if we want to succeed. Many times I have done it for my parents, for my family, for others and things have not fully worked. That can be a good starting point but eventually, you need to do this for YOU.Cheers with this adventure. You can succeed. I also care for you both.",Thank you so much for this response!I talked to my mom and sister and it turns out they both had them. my sister had one after her kids and my mom had anorexia and bulimia when she was a teen. im looking into therapy now because I dont wanna be like this.my only struggle is finding food that won't make me nauseous so far fruits have been a hit for me but everything else I can't even look smell or taste it. I force myself but I can only do it so much.,"Dear ilostmyself.98, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove details about disordered eating behaviors that could be triggering to other users.

Except my husband left when I had our 2nd child. My brain hasn't developed properly due to malnutrition. In some ways, I am childlike but with the responsibility of an adult. It's all so overwhelming. My children are both miracle babies I was told I would never be able to have. They are my only support system without even realizing it. The best way to care for them is to care for myself.",,,,,
37,08/19/2021,MyBoyfriendissofrustratedwithmeandmyED.,"I started battling an ED in November 2020, it went away on its own. But, it came back with so much more force in April this year. Throughout this period, I've gotten help, and im still receiving this help. But my boyfriend, I just don't think he knows what to say or do. Some days, he's completely understanding that my mood changes a lot, especially after the discussion of food or eating, and he comforts me and supports me. But some days, like today, he gets so frustrated with me. I am slowly, very slowly, recovering, but I am still nowhere near where I *should* be. Today, I ate more than I normally would. and didn't want to eat anything for dinner, as I felt full. When I mentioned he should eat, he reacted negatively. He told me to stop talking, and I didn't know what to do after this. I sat on the bed and waited for him to apologise, or come sit with me. But he didn't. I left the room to let him sleep for his early shift, and he followed me out and ranted at me. Saying that I promise him things, and don't act on them. I explained that my feelings throughout the day change, and I can never promise to stick to something. He said that if I wanted someone who would let me just ""not eat"" then I should break up with him, even after I explained that I had eaten more today than I had in weeks, and this was an achievement. I just want him to see that getting angry and frustrated with me, makes me feel worse, when my head is already a mess and pushes negative thoughts onto me. I want him to read more into how he can talk and help me, but I don't want to ask him to. I stood on the stairs crying and telling him that its not that easy, and recovery doesn't come in a day. he says he understands but I don't think he does. He says ""do I have to not eat to get you to eat?"" because I always encourage him to eat. This made me feel awful, like its my fault if he doesn't eat, when im feeling down.
Has anyone else had issues with their partners not understanding how to cope and deal with their partners ED? I just want to know I'm not alone. Thanks <3.","Before I got married, I confessed my ED and informed him he couldn't handle it. He assured me he could. He can't. No one can. How can we expect someone to say or do the right thing around us if we don't even know what that is most of the time? Years later I still get hostility ""I can't help you. I don't know how to help you. Are you going to order something? I hate when you just sit there not eating."" Etc. But other days I get support ""you'll eat when you can. Do you need anything from the store? Try a bite, it's just a bite. I saved you some for when you want it."" Etc. Your boyfriend gets angry and frustrated because he cares and feels he can't help. Understand he is his own person and don't try to micromanage when or what he does or does not eat. They don't like that and it kind of makes us hypocritical. Even with all the knowledge in the world, he will never be you and completely understand. Just remember, he's still by your side through recovery and let that be all that matters.",,,,,,,,,,
38,09/03/2021,OtherwiseUnspecified,"Hi, I was wondering if other people have an ED that doesn't fit into current diagnoses that well, or presents in a way different? I struggled in a PHP group because there was so much focus on a specific way EDs often manifest that I don't experience, it made me feel kind of alienated from my own treatment, or like i should be thankful that it's not ""worse"". But it's a struggle, especially when i can't seem to get treatment to ""fit"" me. I find ""otherwise unspecified"" to be really difficult to navigate. It's like, people tell you that you have aspects for for other ED diagnoses, but also that you're different enough not to fit into either. They also say that labels don't matter. But, I dunno, I find it helpful to use words to describe an experience. Saying that blue is a color so it doesn't matter what type feels like it's just ignoring helpful experiences. Or like, you can't acknowledge that blue is different than green?Sorry if the analogy is confusingHow do some of you navigate an ED that doesn't look like how most treatment thinks of ED? How do you make ED treatment ""fit"" your ED?","I have been given most of the ED-related labels and currently, I do not know what I fit in... last thing I heard was ""OSFED""... so, my problem is not specified, either...I have never been inpatient but at some point, there were not ED Support groups at the place where I was in treatment. So, they sent me to attend some OCD related sessions.I did not have a lot in common with those patients BUT something that we all struggled with was with an obsession and a compulsion. Most of us struggled with anxiety and depression or simply with not finding the way out.So, those are some things you can somehow relate with... and with human suffering, in general.I would suggest you to have your individual therapy sessions and if groups/treatment are being difficult to you because you do not feel you fit in, talk to your team.Maybe they can help you find some other groups where you feel better.I send you a warm hug and I want you to know that you are NOT alone. Eating disorders can come in many ways and forms. We are all different and our ED's are, too.So, keep fighting yours and in the sessions you attend, check if any of the other people's strategies may help you. Or simply ask them for ideas to fight your own daemons...Cheers

39,09/06/2021,Tiredofdoingthistomyself,"Please help me! So I’ve been bulimic since I was younger but I recently gained what I consider to be a lot of weight, and I told myself that I would lose the weight I gained by making myself throw up. I am obsessed with getting down to a specific weight and I have been doing this to myself for (maybe 9 months on and off) 40 days straight. At first the binges and purges were easy.. but now I feel my body struggling. I have chest pains during this, and just recently I have been urinating on myself every time I purge. I am frightened that this is still not enough to convince me to stop. I want help, but I’m also afraid of keeping food down for fear of gaining the weight I have lost back. I am so scared I have decided to reach out for help here. Why am I urinating on myself? What’s causing this chest pain? Is my body finally giving up because I mistreated it for so long? I feel unable to stop despite these problems. I just hope to get some answers, I hope someone else has been in my shoes. Thank you for letting me share.","Hi Immacoolgirl - welcome to the forums.

Seek medical help soon on an outpatient basis if you: •have significant heartburn and/or a burning sensation after eating •have other gastrointestinal concerns •have high blood pressure •struggle with significant joint or muscle pain •have difficulty sleeping (falling and/or remaining asleep) •struggle with fatigue, sudden weight gain, and/or hair loss •have frequent urination or unquenchable thirst •have gained and lost significant weight repeatedly •have gained significant weight in a short period of time •struggle with chronic diarrhea or constipation. Please take good care of yourself!","I am sorry to hear you are struggling with vomiting. At first, it feels like ""paradise"" but as the years go by, your body starts experiencing the consequences.I had bulimia for many years but it came to a point where my body could not tolerate my behaviors any longer. As of now, I barely vomit. That is ""out of my vocabulary"" BUT if I ever do it, I feel very very bad (physically). I perfectly understand your bladder's lack of control. If I vomit, that also happens to me. It is due to the big effort you are putting on your muscles... your chest, your stomach, your back, your bladder, everything.Please get some treatment if you are not receiving any. ED's are a deadly disease and vomiting is something that completely depletes your body from all minerals and nutrients. For example: your chest pain can not only be caused due to the effort of vomiting but also, due to an electrolyte imbalance. That can cause heart attacks...My experience... the first days that you keep the food down, it is really hard. However, the longer you do it, the easier it becomes. Please start leaving that food in your body. Food is energy. It is not a bad thing...AND You DESERVE to LIVE!Hugs

40,07/28/2021,Relapsingafterweighingmyself,"Hi, I have bulimia with phases of anorexia, I'm in recovery for over two years now, and that's also when I banned the scales. They were still in my bathroom, but knowing how much pain they've caused me, I never felt the urge to step on them ever again after finally knowing how good it felt to live a fuller life. I've gained weight, I knew that, it was bothering me, but still, going back into this dark place never felt like an option. Until a couple of days ago, I don't know why, but I stepped on the scales, two days later, and I'm still getting sweaty hands and a racing heart thinking about the number I saw. My BMI is now close to 'overweight', I don't know if I was in such denial or just busy enjoying life, but it made me question everything. I wish I could unsee the number, but the damage's been done and I feel like relapsing is all I can do now to stop this anxiety. I'd be really thankful for some tips <3","Hi Julia,
I am so sorry you had to go though that. I am totally new to this but I saw your post and it caught my attention so I wanted to reach out and tell you that you aren't alone. I haven't been on a scale for as long as I can remember for that exact same reason. You said maybe you were busy enjoying your life? I think that is beautiful and what we should all strive for, not some stupid number on a machine. Maybe focus on all the fun you've had, the enjoyable moments with your self or with friends and family. I say ditch the scale! I am sorry I can't be more helpful, but wanted you to know that someone cares about you and understands what you are going through.","I know I will never be okay with the number on the scale, no matter what that number is. I used to weigh myself obsessively. Thought oh X amount more, get to this number. Then a little more, then a little more. At some point I realized my ED voice would try to convince me to go to nothing. I only get weighed at doctor appointments now and I absolutely hate that they have to do it. I'm tempted sometimes to weigh at home but I don't want to start that vicious number game again.",,,,,,,,,

I try to hide it so i can forget about it. but it’s too late and i want it out but i’m too scared and just let it sit in my body. i want so badly to stop feeling hungry but it’s constant, my mind constantly wanders to what i will eat and when i don’t know what comes over me when i do this, i eat quickly and until my stomach feels like it’s gonna burst and the bag is gone, over and over again. why can’t i learn how to stop? why do i have no self control? i’m trying to control my appetite but sitting at home every day makes things worse, the kitchen is right there, my biggest temptation. it seems like the harder i try to avoid bingeing, the worse it gets. i wish i could be normal about food. does anyone else feel like this?","Welcome to the forums!

43,08/28/2021,Earlydiagnosis:Willitgoawayonitsown?,"Hi everyone,I was recently diagnosis with an eating disorder a couple of weeks ago. While I have had serious body image issues my whole life, leading to a year long work with a therapist, my ED behaviors began less than two months ago. I believe I was diagnosed early because I have an active treatment team for co-existing mental health concerns. Now, I'm shocked an in denial that I could be diagnosed so quickly. My friends and family encourage me to seek the recommended PHP by saying things like ""you wouldn't wait for stage 2 cancer to become stage 4 before getting treatment."" I really think it will go away on its own though. I've tried support groups but I always leave feeling like my struggles are so insignificant because the majority of group members have been suffering for so long.Can anyone relate?Thank you!
AR","ED'S never go away on its own, just gets worse.  You need professional help and a program that specifically is for ED'S.","Thanks for responding. That's what I'm afraid of :( I feel like it's just too early to know though. Has anyone else had experience ""catching"" the ED early on? I feel like my ED isn't valid because it's been such a short period of time.","If it makes you feel any better, I caught my ED relatively early in the scheme of things (got help after 3 months, still getting help but struggling with relapses). If you've reached a point where the ED is diagnosable, then you are sick enough. Something that helps me when I feel like I'm not sick enough is to think about the ED as a worm in my brain, feeding on my ED behaviors. It doesn't want to die, so it sends out messages to sustain itself, i.e. ""you're not sick enough to get help,"" ""you should keep engaging in these behaviors,"" etc. My advice is to call that voice out as your ED, rather than giving that message credence as your own voice.","It might be longer than you think. I can't do numbers, but my ED was underlying for a long time, and then decided to put on a show only recently. I never addressed it before, but it doesn't mean it wasn't there. When a problem starts doesn't matter. You don't earn points for ""suffering"" for a certain amount of time. You are where you are now, and right now, it is a problem. I get the guilt thing though. But there is not ""right"" way to struggle.",,,,,,,
44,08/31/2021,Idon'tknowwhototell,"I was 8 when my sister was diagnosed with anorexia. My family life became a living hell and it genuinely ruined our lives for years and my family is still broken from the effects the illness had on my sister. She's now 23 (was diagnosed at 12) and is still suffering. I'm now in college and am pretty positive that I have anorexia. My sister was extremely skinny and I am not underweight so my family doesn't worry about my health. I don't want to tell my family because I am ashamed that after these years of my sister's suffering that now I've developed one too. And I don't want to tell my college friends because I don't want them to police my eating. But I worry about myself. I don't eat at all like I used to. I am scared of so much food and I try and eat as little as possible every day. But I came back to college after the summer having lost a lot of weight and I got so many compliments :(. Everyone is telling me I look so skinny and that my abs look so good and that I look so hot in my bikini. I don't know how I'm ever gonna be okay gaining weight. I just don't know who could possibly help me. I don't think I could ever tell my parents, who are still taking care of my sister, that I now need help too. And I don't want my college friends, who already are a bit concerned about me, because they personally are not okay with being around disordered eating as girls who have struggled with food themselves. When one of our friends started eating less and less, they expressed that it was hard for them to be around, and we aren't friends with her anymore, whether that's the reason I am not sure. I just feel trapped. There's really no one I can tell, and I love the way my body looks. But I can only feel safe eating certain foods and I worry about the path I am going down. :(","First I like to say I lived the disease for 30 years now.  My exspouse had the disease our entire marriage and  2 of my daughters have dealt with it or are currently dealing with it.  There are a few things that I have picked up on regarding your post. First, you are afraid you have an eating disorder and your friends are telling you how skinny you are yet you don't think you are underweight. This has to do with acceptance, peer pressure and judgement.  Having to worry about what you eat while worrying about how others perceive you means you are heading down a dangerous path.  Second, you mention that your sister has had an ED for many years.  You are torn between the attention your sister received as attention that you did not get and the fact that it was negative attention that was harmful to the family.  Don't worry, as hard as it may have been for your parents, they love you just as much as your sister and will still love you the same even if you decide to tell them regarding your ED.  Eating disorders are very difficult for everyone including family and friends'  The most important thing is finding help.  I am sure your parents love you and want to help.  They cannot help if they don't know.  I am not sure if you are religious, but trusting in God can be a huge help in recovery.  Jesus loves you unconditionally and accepts you for who you are.  Some of my blogs on my website might help.  Let me know if you need any more advice.  I know clinics etc. that can be great resources.","Dear faith2joy, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove the outside link, which is not allowed on the NEDA forums.

45,08/31/2021,AmIjustbeingdramatic,"Hi!First of all I would just like to apologise for my English, you see I'm from Finland.That being said I will get to the point, even though I don't really know what my point is exactly.I have a lovely family that is unfortunately very focused on looks. My two older sisters have had and currently have problems with food and body-image. And the negative, self hating talk is the talk I have grown up with.I didn't think much of it when I was about 13-years-old (I'm 18 now) and I hated my thighs. I couldn't think about anything else. I remember wearing two pairs of leggings and jeans over them when it was a hot summer day. I just wanted to look skinny.Then I started boxing and running and going to the gym. I started loving exercise and I liked how I didn't look ""skinny fat"" anymore.But now as of lately it has come to the point where I can't cope if I can't exercise like I wanted to. Even though I more often than not feel like I just want to rest. Other people do don't they?Food was fuel before. You can't be an athlete if you don't eat. But eating has become a fear of mine. I still eat and currently I'm eating somewhat okay. But every time I don't eat when I'm supposed to I'm proud of myself. Every time I feel weak because I'm hungry I feel proud of myself.I compete with people that don't know I'm competing with them. If they eat little, I eat less. If they exercise, I will do twice as much. Because If I don't do that I feel like I have let myself go and I will gain weight. And what more is there to me than looking fit? That is my thought process. And the hardest thing is that I don't know if I want to change it. Well I know I do because I don't like living like this, but I am scared of losing control if I don't get to think like this.I don't know if I said anything even though I said a lot. It is just hard to put into words.
But the question that is constantly on my mind is am I just being dramatic?","I do not think you are being dramatic. Comparison is the thief of joy and we, as people with eating disorders, compare what we eat, our body and our exercise to everyone around. We are competitive but that competitiveness just causes us pain.I used to feel like you when I was your same age. I used to check what my sister was eating to eat less. I used to check her workouts to do more and you know what? That life style became like a prison....modern slaveryI know that if you are mentioning this is because this is something that bothers you. But I want you to know that it can be changed. Please look for a school counselor or see a therapist.

47,08/29/2021,Outoftreatment&struggling...,"I was in inpatient treatment for almost 6 weeks and got home just over a month ago.
I did really well there.I gained the weight.I didn't struggle there with my meals or snacks at all.I was really motivated and felt so strong.I did a lot of hard work in CBT and DBT.When I got home I set up an appointment with a private dietician (whom i can't really afford,nor can i afford her prescribed meal plan).I was supposed to have had an appointment with her on the 4th of September but have already abandoned that idea.I haven't been eating at all the way I learned to in treatment.They told me to keep weighing myself,that it would be important for my pyschiatrist and dietcian (Both of whom I only can have appointments over the phone with due to covid so can't be weighed in their offices.) to know my weight and important for ME to know my weight-
So I have been weighing myself twice a week on the same days as i was being weighed in treatment.To be honest,I haven't been at all triggered by the number,but I am triggered by the changes in my body.I haven't really been eating meals,just snacking or bineging.Part of the reason for this is ever since I got home my GAD and OCD have been overwhelming me,and anxiety tends to steal my appetite.Yesterday i had a very bad anxiety attack and really had to force myself to eat just a very little bit.This morning I have kept telling myself I need to eat breakfast but I haven't.And I found myself looking at the calories on an item without really meaning to.It also occurred to me to weigh myself,when I am not supposed to weigh myself until tomorrow.All in all getting into dangerous territory.Already.I am so ashamed of myself.I was just in the ER the other day with a very bad anxiety attack and suicidal ideation and my OCD was so intense but they would not help me.I also had called a crisis line that morning but the guy wasn't helpful at all either really.These experiences have made me hesitate to seek out help in the future.In the ER the pysch resident asked me how I was doing with my anorexia,and I told her I wasn't actively trying to lose weight-I'm not-(At least not yet) but that I have a voice in my head sometimes that tells me i am not allowed to eat.(Not an auditory hallucination,but,you know,that eating disorder ""voice."")I know I should be eating even when I don't feel hungry-I don't want to continue with the dietcian or her meal plan.It was both a very overwhelming and expensive meal plan.My GP arranged for me to have free supplements but I haven't even been drinking those.My weight has been going up and down over the past few weeks.I don't understand.i did so well in treatment.I came home on a ""high"" as my pyschiatrist said.Now I have fallen so far even though i am still,at least not conciously,trying to lose weight.In treatment i was told not to let more than four hours go by without eating.Well I quite frequently find I have done just that.At first this was truly anxiety driven but now i fear it has become a way of coping again.And a focus for my OCD apart from my other disturbing obsessions.I don't know what I am looking for here exactly.I really just needed to get this out somewhere.My pyschiatrist is also my therapist and i have been being honest with him about this but as of this week he doesn't know how bad it has gotten.Anyway...I am sorry,this has been way too long a post.Thank you for reading if you have.Oh I have so much shame over this...","Hi silverstars, we are sorry to hear about this challenging time.

48,08/28/2021,Relapsing...,"Hello all. I've made it through the first two weeks of college (I am a freshman) and things aren't going as well as I hoped. I suffer from anorexia, bulimia, and ironically on top of that, binge eating. I've been struggling with these things since 2016, but I relapsed, hard, over the summer. I was lucky enough to get a nutritionist and I had a good three weeks of bliss. I was eating enough, I wasn't fasting, and I was finally able to get back to the gym, fitness being a life-long passion for me. However, the stress of moving out and actually being in college seemed to be too much. I binged hardcore before coming, and I've binged hardcore since. I keep having thoughts telling me to fast for days at a time and have to actively have my mom call me to make sure I eat on the days I'm not binging. I find myself at my university's gym working for hours and hours trying to get any calories off. It's already causing me difficulty in my classes, I feel totally overwhelmed and like I'm drowning. I can't stop bodychecking and comparing myself to others. I have no idea how to bring myself out of this cycle. Is there anyone else who relapsed going to college? How did you get yourself out of it? Help! I've never felt more alone in my life with managing my disorder.","I'm in a very similar boat! I just finished my first week of college and for the last year my anorexia has turned into bulimia and binge eating. I used to ignore the binge eating as a consequence of restriction but recently I haven't been restricting or purging. I've been binging BAD for the last few weeks with no symptoms of anorexia anymore. I'm doing okay with body image, but I don't like how binge eating gets treated vs restriction. I feel like even though binge eating is a more common issue, people don't care unless you're anorexic. Personally, the binge eating makes me feel sooooo invalid, as much as I felt in the worst part of my restriction. College-wise, I feel like if I stay busy with homework or something in a library all day and schedule my meals, then I am a little distracted from food. I still end up bingeing at night so sometimes I take melatonin to sleep through? I really don't know what the best course of action is.",accidentally posted the above reply twice,"I understand how you feel. I experienced a similar situation at college. I was normal but in my second semester, my ED showed up. It started as anorexia that then became binge eating followed by exercise bulimia. I ended up with bulimia and almost killing myself.What I would suggest you to do? Please talk to one of the school counsellors. Most of the schools provide counseling services. I found a great person to work with at that period of my life and was able to finish school and handle my life at the moment. That person helped me overcome anorexia. Unfortunately, then, my ED mutated and I fell down into bulimia.You are not alone and what you are experiencing is pretty common for people going to college.Talk it out and honestly, stop the long work out hours. Otherwise, you will be so exhausted that you will not be able to focus on your studies.","Hi workingonitc19, thank you for posting on the forums. We’re glad that you’re here.

49,07/05/2021,Nocturnaleatingsyndrome,Hi does anyone here have NES?  I would like to connect with someone who understands what I'm going through.,Just bumping as still seeking someone with the same ED,"I have this.  This started for me after I lost my mother.  I am not a young person, but when I get up in the night ususally to go to the bathroom or take the dog out, I always want to eat, I don't eat alot, but I look for something, not meat and potatoes, usually sweet or some desert type thing or candy that we have in the house.  I hate this habit, I hide it from my partner and everyone too.  I try to drink water instead, it doesn't satisfy it.  I know it's not good for you.  Do you have any tricks that help? Do you eat more then just sweets, etc.? I sort of dismiss it, but I know that it's probably not a normal way of eating, especially because I hide it. Tell me about your NES.",Hi. Thank you for your reply.  I usually eat sweet things when I wake up. But I also eat savoury stuff.  My only trick is to try not to fight it.  I know I am incapable of not eating when I wake up so I try and plan what I eat.  I lay it out on the Bench in the hopes of limiting what I eat.  It doesn't always work. I have seen an eating disorder psychiatrist and.she said it is because I don't eat enough during the day.  But I don't eat at night because I'm hungry. And I used to be obese and eat lots during the day but I still had the night time eating problem.  So I was very disappointed in her comment.  And now I feel like she won't bother to look for the real reason why I eat at night.,I just joined this group as i realized that i have NES as well. I overeat at night when everyone else in the house is asleep.  Mostly sweets that are easy for me to digest - no protein.  I start thinking about what I am going to overeat early in the day.  I try to control it - but finding it very hard.  I have tried eating more at dinner to be less hungry at night - does not help.   I tried eating less during the day - also no help.,Hi there. Sorry to hear of your struggles with food.,,,,,,
50,08/03/2021,StartingRecovery(Hopefully),"Hi I am a person who is trying so hard to start recovery and every time I try or make steps in the right direction I always fall back into my terrible thoughts. I told a few of my friends about my disorder and none of my family, from my knowledge, knows about my disorder. When I was in college I saw a school counselor and talked to her about my eating habits but I'm not a person who talks about my feelings much. this is why my family doesn't know and why even though I told my closest friends once I feel I can't talk to them again about it. I want to so badly but I feel I'm just going to annoy them and they will get mad at me. This doesn't help with the fact that all I want to do in workout and not eat. I was happiest when I was at my lowest point in my life because I was also at my lowest weight and I can't seem to shake that memory and want it back so badly even after I ""recovered"" from it. I just feel like if I don't do something soon there is no turning back, but the things I need to do I also feel I can't because no one will care and they will tell me to get over it...","Hello there.
I hope you are doing okay.
I was reading your post and wanted to say that I think I understand how you feel. For a lot of people (me too), I've heard  that it is completely nerve wracking and terrifying to talk to others about this. At one point in my life I also thought no one cared and I didn't want to tell anyone about my behaviours either. But telling my mom and then my sister was probably one of the best choices I've ever made.
Sometimes my mom will get mad at me for the ed behaviours, but she always moves back into a place of love and support. I've realised that when she gets mad at me at first it is because she loves me and is genuinely afraid for my health and wellness. So sometimes, I think it helps to try to accept others' feelings about the behaviour, because I become mad at it too sometimes.
And I know that not everyone has a supportive family system, but for me family has been important so I am very thankful. But even if they weren't supportive, if I never let my family know then I wouldn't know if I could count on them for support or if I needed to look somewhere else. So I'm a strong believer in trying to find support when appropriate because getting better is so, so difficult to do alone.
And even though there have been scary or difficult moments, I just know that telling the people I'm close to about this seems to make us even closer and my eating  disorder thrives in secrecy, so it is very important for me that others know. In the past when I kept it a secret and didn't want to talk about it with anyone, it spiralled out of control. And then I would try to get better on my own. This happened several times. It didn't work.
After telling just two people and talking with them regularly and joining support groups, I feel better and more hopeful than I have in quite awhile. I want to get better now.
So there is some food for thought if you would like to consider it. You certainly aren't alone and I hope you start to get better soon.","Hi! I just wanted to let you know I understand how you feel and you are not alone. I too am trying to get back into recovery and it’s not easy. I was deep into my ED for years and in therapy during that time. It was only when I hit my rock bottom and my treatment team fired me that I decided it was time to actually make some changes (I also was able to get pregnant as I was staring to make changes and the health of my baby mattered more than the ED). It’s now been years since I was considered anorexic, but the thoughts are coming back and so have the behaviors. I am back in therapy with a new therapist and I’m not sure how to feel about it. I want to lose weight and feel good about myself, but I don’t know how to lose weight without ED thoughts and behaviors. Maybe you could find a therapist you could talk to. I know it’s difficult for me to open up to friends and family because I feel ashamed that I’m dealing with issues surrounding food and something necessary for survival. It’s embarrassing for me to talk about an eating disorder with friends and family. I don’t want their pity and I don’t want their policing dinner tables and bathrooms and gyms. There’s no just getting over it with EDs, if it were that simple there would be a lot of facilities and therapists out of jobs. EDs thrive on secrecy, try to find someone you trust enough to be able to open up with.",Alguien sabe de alguna aplicacion en español que ayide con los transtornos al8menticios gracias,,,,,,,,

52,07/12/2021,hangingoutwithfriendsandcomparison,I am fairly new to this whole recovery thing and most of the time I feel like I’m blindly walking into situations and no knowing what I am doing. Something that has been a huge struggle for me lately is hanging out with my friends. During my ed “peak” i felt more validated when around them because they are all so thin and i was to the point where I was getting thin as well. Now with the weight gain I feel like an outsider always comparing myself to them which leads to this rotten voice in my head telling me I’m not good enough to be their friend. I have also noticed them hanging out more and more without me and I feel like it has todo with my self image but I’m not 100% if that’s the reason or not. Every time I hangout with them I have trouble eating for a few days but when I don’t hangout with them my I feel lonely. There is something inside of me telling me to just completely go off the grid until I can get the disorder under control but if I leave it feel like there might not be any coming back back...,"Same here. My friends were all thin and I was bigger. Not really overweight just bigger and more athletic. I really wanted to fit in and didn't like how I looked so I started exercising more and eating less. I ended up with an ED. Now they don't even talk to me or invite me out. I see social media of them all going out together, but when I text them to see if they want to hang out they ignore me! I never did anything to them except be a kind and supportive friend. I just don't get it. I'm so depressed over this. I know I have a long way to go but I'm trying my best. I have lost every friend I had growing up and don't know why.","and Not always for the better. Friends grow up, date, party, eat, and eat and eat, and may not wish to bring in a friend who may be overwhelmed by their ability to live the style that they live. Friends get older, more into their family, or travel, join the military and never look back, or get older and are responsible for their family. You might try finding some groups or activities to meet new friends, they have meet ups and Craigslist and other singles groups that get together to walk around the big city, volunteer , reading clubs, etc. Good luck in taking a Lateral Transfer from old ways and friends and take a chance on some new groups, or volunteer positions.Good Luck..................",,,,,,,,,
