0,05/25/2021,reactionarybingeeating,"Hi everyone,
I think my sister has a binge eating disorder but any time I try to bring up getting help to her, it always results in more binge eating. I don't know how to talk to her about getting help because I'm always scared it's going to result in a binge. Does anyone have any experience with this and how did you successfully stop this cycle? Also, I've read in guides that when you talk to them about getting help you should try to limit mention of food or their eating habits, but I'm not sure how to site my concerns about her binges otherwise. Does anyone have any advice? Could you give me examples?Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,08/05/2020,Respondingtoweightcomments,"My younger sister has begun treatment for ED which is great, but I'm struggling as a sister to help her when people comment on her drastic weight loss. She has admitted that there is a part of her that wants to hear these comments to reassure her weigh loss, but the other part of her is torn apart. Unfortunately we live in a world where people feel it's acceptable to make these comments, and as an older sister I have jumped to her defense in simply saying that the person making the comment ""Doesn't need to mention it."", but I don't know if this is the best way of handling it. Should I give her the opportunity to respond? Is there a better response without divulginf her ED? Any advice is appreciated!!","Hey there.I wasn't quite sure what you meant here.  Were you wanting to know what to say to the people who make those kinds of comments to your sister ?  If so, I'm not sure what to tell you.  Here in the US it's rude to say those sorts of things, but I know that in other cultures it seems to be common, and a normal thing for people to make comments like that.  I suppose you could tell people to mind their own business, but I'm not sure that that would do much to help relive the tension of the situation. And as you said, it's probably not your place to bring up your sister's ED.  So it's a difficult matter for sure.How to help your sister to deal with these kinds of comments is another thing.  As you said, on the one hand her ED may be reassured by such comments, but if she is also trying to recover, they aren't helpful.  One thing that's true is that people who make these kinds of comments are rude and ignorant, but the fact that the two of you both understand that…It's good that you do, but I'm not sure how much comfort your sister is going to feel, knowing that there are rude people in this world. So it's a tough situation for sure.  Being able to say ""I know it must be confusing to hear people make those kinds of comments""…sometimes I think that would be the most comforting thing for her to hear from you ?Like that someone else understands, you know ?Anyhow, just some thoughts.","Way to go being your sister’s ally, for one. So many people with EDs struggle to find support within their family, so... I think you’re really awesome no matter what. This is a tough situation because the people saying these things to your sister might be well meaning though let’s be real, their comments are rude. Unfortunately, commentary on weight has been in our culture’s crosshairs for a long time. If she isn’t getting a message about weight personally from someone, it will come through media and other sources. So... it’s impossible to protect her from it. She may need to be the one to shut down the comments with you at her side. That puts the power in her camp, but you can still support her as she navigates dealing with this part of our culture (which we can only hope continues to change for the better). Thanks for being an ally, you are making the world better for your sister and so many others out there!",,,,,,,,,,,
2,04/23/2020,Momdoesn'tbelieve/careenough?,"My sister has struggled with an eating disorder for about 5 years. Our family is awful at communication, so we've never actually talked about it but we all know. I could tell from the very beginning and would often get angry with my mom for not making my sister eat or allowing her to skip meals and over exercise. My mom never saw anything wrong in this, even as my sister lost an incredible amount of weight and became a skeleton. I finally convinced her to get my sister some help so she took her to a nutritionist and our GP, but never a mental health professional. She's gained a little weight, enough to satisfy my mom, but she still looks very unhealthy and scary to me. My sister recently mentioned that she missed her period and my mom completely brushed it off and just said ""it happens."" With my sister going to college in a few months, I'm absolutely terrified that she'll get even worse. Please help me! I need advice for how to talk to my mom and make her take this seriously! Thank you so much","Hi.  I want to welcome you to the forum.  I am sorry you have been going through so much with your sisters illness. I understand the whole ""sweeping things under the rug"".  It is frustrating and can cause anger as have been experiencing.  It can be very scary watching someone so close to you suffering and not being given the help that your sister needs.  I am that sister.  I was very ill for most of my life and it was very scary for my younger sister watch and she had lived in fear that I woud die.  My other sisters just got angry with me and never tried to understand so I applaud you for wanting to get your sister help   So you and your sister talk about this at all?  Is she able to confide in you or anyone?  Your mothers lack of action may be out of fear or just not understanding how dangerous eating disorders can be.  On NEDA's web site, there is what is called the Parent Tool Kit. In that there are suggestions on how to help with a child that has an eating disorder.  It may be helpful for you as well.  You are correct in saying that it seems important to get her help now, before she goes off to college.  Do you know why your mother doesn't want her to get psychological counselling?  I know this is scary and I am glad you reached out.  Please continue to as much as you need.  And check out the resources NEDA puts out, you may even want to chat with someone from the organization.  Take care of yourself too while you are dealing with all of the fear and family dynamics that are challenging.  Please post again.iwanttolive","Hey Cactusmoon.  I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this as a family. When I was going through my eating disorder as a teen, my family had a similar dynamic in terms of brushing it under the rug, which ultimately made things worse of course.  I think appealing to her mom could be a good approach, and perhaps appealing in the most non-accusatory way that you can while trying to inspire action?  The turning point for me getting treatment was actually a neighbor who approached my parents and voiced her concerns and went to them with more of a ""I know this is scary, and this isn't your fault, but we have to do something or your daughter is going to die.""  Every family is different, and every situation is different.  I'm sharing what triggered action in my situation in the hopes that it might be a viable avenue for you.  Good luck, and great job seeking support!",,,,,,,,,,,
3,08/30/2020,Whattodo?,I didn’t see a forum for family members that weren’t siblings so I apologize but this is my cousin. She has been doing this for years while she was a minor and now that she just turned 18. Her mother refuses to admit that she has anorexia even though doctors and psychologists diagnosed her. Her father is too weak to stand up to his wife. Her mother got her out of the hospital twice within days because she refused to say her daughter has a problem. My cousin is no longer going to doctors appointments now that she is an adult. What can I do? She has never looked thinner. Her heart rate is in the low 30s. She is dying and I don’t know what I can do me and her brother have tried to talk to her and she completely shuts us out. Any help works I just need to do something.,"Hi monkcarter, thank you for posting. We’re sorry to hear about this difficult situation. You mentioned some medical symptoms your family member has experienced.

Please take care, and we wish you the best.","Yep, it's good to see a list of what the person *should* do, and what sort of things *should* alarm them, but when the whole set-up seems to be based on denial, as you said, it's hard to know how we can help. So I guess I would ask how totally she has shut you out.  Do you think she reads any of the things that you send her ?  If she does, then there may be some ways to help, although they may not always serve to convince her to do the things that you wish she would do.What I mean is….it's unlikely that she doesn't know she's in trouble. Not too many people in her position honestly believe that everything's fine.  This doesn't mean they are anxious to quit though. Often they want to keep losing instead. So perhaps you can imagine the sort of dilemma it puts them in.  And then she has to deal with her parents, who sound like they have some issues of their own. So rather than pointing out the ways in which she's endangering herself (which she may already be aware of) instead you might want to say something like  ""I imagine it might be difficult to be dealing with how things are going on the home front.""Her response to which might be ""Thank God  someone finally gets it about that.""Is this sort of approach going to help her quit having an ED ?  Probably not.  But it can help her feel less emotionally alone with her situation.  And that is something that  can make a difference.",,,,,,,,,,,

5,08/04/2020,Howcanihelpmylittlesister,"My little sister is 15 and in this past year has developed anorexia. She lost a lot of weight and is now really underweight and had to get bloodwork done at the hospital. They discovered physical symptoms during that doctor visit I never even knew of, she had kept secret. I realized that even I had not realized how serious her ED had become. My mom is now searching for a therapist, although the only open appointments were a month away. She’s still looking for more immediate help for my sister but i fear that because she isn’t in an inpatient nor outpatient program she isn’t getting the help she needs so desperately. I cry everyday because i hate myself for not speaking up when i initially noticed her exercising daily and eating less. She is now severely underweight, and she constantly is frowning even while my family is laughing with eachother and i look over and i notice it. It makes me sad that she is so unhappy all the time, i know the ED is taking its toll on her mental health. She also stays home a lot, she’s the only one in my family who doesn’t work, so it’s difficult to cheer her up unless my mom is home to take her out- even then she seems down and has a temper. I want to know anything i can do to help. We had a really heartfelt conversation the day she went to the doctor, and i continue to make lunches for her and dinners that she will eat. Yet she isn’t eating much more than before, still small portions- even if now she’s eating 2 meals rather than 1 barely eaten meal a day. Im just worried we aren’t getting her help quickly enough. I’m constantly stressing that i’m not helping enough because i don’t know how to approach the topic. I ask if she is okay, if she is hungry, i hangout with her and watch tv with her when im home.. I just fear that she is so depressed and crippled by this. She tells my mom she struggles so much with eating & does not wanna gain weight. Since she kept it a secret so long i think its so much more comfortable for her to just keep her thoughts to her self, she tells my mom the most out of any of us but. I wanna be there for her too as best i can. Are we doing anything that is hurting her? Is there anything I should take into account? I would so much appreciate the advice of someone who has recovered from such a brutal disorder.. How can i show my sister recovery is worth it?","Hey there.Not recovered myself, and never had an ED, but I talk online with a lot of people who do, and yeah…How able are loved ones to help with situations like this ?But first, try not to blame yourself, OK ?  EDs tend to sneak up on people, and while we can look back and think about all of the things that we wished we had done, and berate ourselves for not being aware of things which seem obvious now, the fact is that most people aren't very familiar with EDs, and it's kind of the normal thing for it to take a while for them to figure things out. Plus it's clear that you care, or else you would never have posted here in the first place.  So I hope you can set you mind to rest about those things.   Or just a little I mean.And yeah, your sister sounds like she's in the thick of it alright. Being cranky and irritable all the time is a pretty common symptom when people suspect that others are ""against them"" and are going to be wanting them to give up their ED.  I mean don't people understand all of the effort and extreme self-discipline it's taken them to get to this point ?  And they expect her to welcome the idea of throwing that all away, and  just ""getting fat"" again ?   You can understand why she might be feeling pissy.  Other people just don't get it, you know ?So yeah, what can you do ?  Not as much as you might want to, because so much of what happens is going to be up to her.  So you'll need to get used to that part.  Which can be really hard to get used to. You mentioned how much she stays in, and that may be a place where you can help.  It's like people with EDs can start losing touch with the world, as their own world begins to narrow in around them, so anything you can do to try and keep her in touch with the wider world, I do think that's a role we can play.    Go on a hike, go to the museum (if you can)- anything to keep her in touch with the world. That may not seem like much, but sometimes things like that can give the person a break from the never-ending ED chatter that's going on in their heads.Plus people with EDs are often frustrated.  They just aren't losing weight fast enough, people are always bugging them about their habits, God knows what's going to happen when they make her see this therapist person - They have a lot of things to feel frustrated about. So that is something you could say to her.  ""It must be frustrating to have to deal with all this.""  So there you go ; you guys would have something you could agree on, and she'd be able to think that at least you get it about that part.  Which is good, you know ?Anyhow, just some thoughts.  My sense is that there are going to be a bunch of more ""stages"" to go through in all this, so keep writing if it seems to help.B.J.",,,,,,,,,,,,
6,06/25/2020,Adviceonaddressingadultsister'sdenial?,"Hi everyone. I only made an account because my sister has refused therapy and continues to deny having an issue. Our mother and I both confronted her about it (she tried to turn me against our mother in an argument about whether she is anorexic or not), but she isn't buying it. I'm well aware that denial and an unwillingness to go through treatment is a big part of eating disorders, so I'm not surprised. I just don't know what to do about it.She can't really be forced to go to therapy because 1) it would be cruel of our mother to do the whole ""become independent or cooperate with therapy"" trick during the pandemic, and 2) she is 18 years old. My sister lives with our mother and has never had a job before if that communicates her lack of independence enough. She was diagnosed with autism when she was little, so the idea of using ultimatums like the one I mentioned above is even more difficult than it normally would be.I'm 22 and live on my own (with my fiancé). I actually live on the other side of the U.S., away from the rest of my family (I'm not close with my mother at all, long story). This means I don't have a lot of opportunities to confront my sister about it in person. I haven't tried anything after the first conversation because I have low tolerance for stuff like this, and I don't have the energy to field someone else's serious mental health issues when I am dealing with my own; I have severe OCD and a specific phobia that I am undergoing Exposure Response Prevention therapy for.I know I am improving, and I know that anyone is capable of doing the same if they bother to try. Problem is, she won't. She won't even imagine a world in which she is wrong or in denial. She thinks she's healthy when she is wire-thin and hardly eats. She obsessively reports her unimpressive snacks or small meals to me when she has them to ""prove"" that I'm wrong about her anorexia, or at least that's what it seems like she's doing since she never did this before I talked to her about it.What course of conversation or way of communicating is helpful when trying to get through that denial? I wonder if she finally sees the light, maybe she will do something about it.","It's true, people with EDs can worry about family members becoming aware that they have an eating disorder. And it often turns into the situation you've described.  Denial, and anger towards those who are trying to call them on it. At the same time, she knows that the cat's out of the bag now.  And that you guys do know what the story is.  So as much as she may try and prove that ""everything's fine"", she's aware that you already know that it's not. Alternately, I suppose it's just possible that she believes that she's on a regular diet. But I kind of doubt it.  And like you said, sending you pictures of her meals, that's a little obsessive, you know ?  As an aside, people with EDs often do this - take pictures of their meals I mean. So it was interesting to hear you mention her doing that.  In any case, I hope you guys don't end up stalled in the ""everything's fine"" stage of things for too long.  It's a big waste of time and energy, when you could be talking about more productive things instead. Which is something you may want to try with her.  How's she doing with getting out of the house, for example ?  Or pursuing that sorts of hobbies which may have once interested her ?  Or keeping in touch with her friends ?  People with EDs often find that the breath of their lives is becoming narrower and narrower, and that is something which can become a concern for them. So maybe she'd be more willing to talk about the non-food angles of her life with you ?  Because those sorts of things can effect people's eating disorders as well.Also, might the be things going on to cause her to feel like she's not in control of her life ?  Feelings of not-being-in-control cam lead to eating disorders as well, so that's something you might want to enquire about, if she'd be willing to talk about such things.This all may seem like you are coming at the issue indirectly, but such things may play into this in important ways, and if she can talk with you about those things, it may end up providing the both of you with the sorts of openings-of-communication that you're after. Keep in touch ?","Obviously denial is major in this illness, but for me the scary realization was the undeniable medical evidence that I was quite literally killing my own body by starving it. If I were you, I  would ask her to get a wellness check up, ""just to be safe"", but you would want to make sure that she is honest with the doctor about her limited food intake, even if she thinks ""it's fine/no big deal"". This is because, even if as of right now, her blood work or other lab results are not critical, the doctor will still express concern and be able to warn her about the dangers she is bringing upon herself, and recommend a safer level of food intake. Would there be anyone who could attend this appointment with her, to make sure she does mention the disordered eating to the physician? Perhaps your mother or another sibling if you have one.",,,,,,,,,,,
7,06/16/2020,18yearoldsisterpotentiallyhasbulimiaandidkwhattodo,"Context: I haven’t seen my sister in a year due to her moving to Florida to be with her biological father (who hasn’t been in her life for at least 16 years but that’s another story) and she has been living with my mom in California, and they have always had a tumultuous relationship. Neither one has been great to the other, my mom has talked about my sisters weight a lot, especially when she was going through puberty, and my sister has always tried to disobey my moms rules. My sister has also been manipulative with money and has just been mean to everyone, including myself, leaving to be with her friends only 2 hours after I’ve landed, despite listening to her over the phone as well as help her financially despite not having a job myself.At dinner tonight, my sister had a pretty small amount of curry and 15-20 minutes later, went to the bathroom saying her stomach hurt. My mom and I then both heard her turn the sink on and my mom knew right away what she was doing, and yelled at my sister to unlock the door, and when she did I saw the sink was in fact on and we both saw her trying to make herself sick.My mom has essentially given up on my sister, saying that the stress is not worth it for her health (she struggles with ovarian cysts from time to time and they get worse when she’s stressed) and she has encouraged me to do the same, but as the oldest sister at 22, and my sister being 18, don’t want to and I don’t want to be responsible for her death if there’s something I can do.I don’t even know if there IS anything I can do, she pushes everyone away willing to help her (including myself) and I even recommended her a therapist that would take her insurance, but she hasn’t seemed to reach out to her.","I'm sorry this is happening, it's a very tense situation, and it will be tough to figure out what to do. Maybe sit her down and tell her how much you love her and why what she is doing is not necessary. I think it's important that your family stays united, and does not get frustrated or angry with her.","You wrote :"" I even recommended her a therapist that would take her insurance, but she hasn’t seemed to reach out to her."" The thing is, people with bulimia often don't want to be helped.  They want to continue doing what they are doing instead. When you
recommended that she see a therapist, she probably understood  you to mean that you wanted her to get therapy to get rid of her eating disorder. Which is something she probably does not want to get rid of.  So no wonder she didn't follow up.However…it sounds like she has plenty of other things she could talk to a therapist about. How she doesn't get along with your mom, and how everyone tries to control her, and other things of that nature.Which are legitimate things to be concerned about, and which may also have some tie-ins with her eating disorder.So yeah, it's not like she has to necessarily get help for her ED, she could get help for other things too.  Which is an idea which might sound more appealing to her ?Anyhow, just some thoughts.  Things like this are difficult, and sometimes you gotta come at them from the side to begin with, rather than starting by confronting them head on.",,,,,,,,,,,
8,04/29/2020,HowcanIbesthelpher,"Hi - I am new the forum and I am very thankful for it! Recently, I have been home living with my sister because of all the recent quarantine orders. I have been very aware of my sisters ED. She Is diagnosed with disordered eating and does not yet fit the criteria for a specific ED. Living with her and seeing her habits form / fluctuate have been so hard for me. I just keep watching her control so much of her food and go so many days eating so little. My fear, of course, is the disease growing and becoming more and more severe. My sister is aware of her struggles and actually acknowledges how difficult it’s been for her.
I guess I am struggling with how to live with her that is supportive but also learning to cope there is not much I can do... she is older, 20, and typically at school living away from home. I also am typically not home with her but given the circumstances. I also am a fixer and it is such my instinct to be proactive and try and assist and fix the problem which we all know doesn’t work unless the person wants to get better. Any advice on how to process, and mostly learn how to not worry so much about our siblings. Also maybe just more information on what’s appropriate to support them but not push them or become fixated on things.  Thank you in advanced. I know there is so much more to this story that is too much to share.  i appreciate everyone here.",We understand your concern and want you to know that we have some resources to assist you.

We're in pretty much the same boat. My sister is also 20, and we don't usually live together but quarantine has brought us both back from college to our parents house. I don't know if my parents are really aware that she struggles with this; she's had mental health issues in the past but she's never seen someone for eating disorder related things specifically as far as I know. I think I might only know about it because I pay attention (and sometimes she hints at it on social media). But the last couple weeks I've noticed it's getting worse. She doesn't eat all day until a she eats a smallish dinner (we eat dinner as a family, and I think she's trying to keep us from noticing). She also has taken up running, which scares me cause I know she's exercising on an empty stomach and that can be dangerous.
I don't know what to do! I'm kind of afraid to bring it up with her, I don't really know why. Maybe I'm afraid that she'll just hide from me more and will stop trusting me. I also don't want to tell my parents because I don't think they will deal with it well. I feel so stuck and scared and helpless. I'm also the kind of person who needs to fix things, and she's my younger sister so I will always feel very protective of her. I guess my first step is probably to talk to her about it but I'm afraid and overwhelmed. Ugh","hi guys. i am in the same boat as your sisters-- home from school with eating disorder struggles while trying to make sure no one notices or gets too concerned. i grew up watching my sister suffer from life threatening depression, and there is no worse feeling of hopelessness as you watch someone's mental health crumble. as far as EDs go, the best thing that you can do is just check in. not ""i noticed you aren't eating"" or ""please eat"" or anything drastic, just ask if something is up and if there is anything you can do. this is hard to hear but there is probably nothing you can say to get rid of disordered thoughts and behaviors, but encouraging to get help and even offer to keep the conversation confidential from parents. I am so nervous about concerning my parents, and if they aren't jumping at the idea to talk to a therapist the last thing you should do is bring parents into the conversation right at the jump. encourage professional help, ask what you can do, find out what is helpful by asking and know that you cannot fix them, but you can help them find a way to seek recovery :)","also-- expressing concern is nice but one of the worst ED thoughts i experience is wanting to keep things from everyone because you don't want to make the whole family's life worse with an ED. if my sister came to me and said ""i am worried about you and i am scared"" i would feel terrible for my actions affecting her emotions. definitely doesn't apply to everyone but just something to consider",,,,,,,,,
9,04/16/2020,Canpeopletrulyunderstand?,"I feel I've reached a breaking point in talking to friends about my sister's ED. But I also feel torn about my frustration with this - is it really fair to blame them for not understanding what I'm going through? Does anyone else feel this frustration?My sister is on her 5th hospital admission now and has been struggling for the last 10 years with this illness. Early on I was met with all of the classic unhelpful remarks, which I would try to take lightly. But I feel like those around me are now just tired of this situation and don't want to talk to me about it anymore. I'm constantly met with ""she's back in hospital again?"" and ""Is this still going on?"" (sadly those quotes are not exaggerations). It's not only just a lack of understanding of the illness but I think people find it hard, in general, to talk about illnesses that seemingly have no end or cure in sight. There is no silver lining they can try and comfort you with so instead they'd rather not talk about it at all. But I've got to the point where this frustration is causing me to end relationships and friendships as I find it so difficult to be around people that make these comments and have these misunderstandings. I know I should try and be more forgiving to them but in all honestly, I've run out of energy to do that. Part of me just thinks I should stop talking about this with friends all together and I am really lucky to have a great family support system who are so helpful. But not talking about it at all with people I am close to just seems impossible. This is part of my life, a very big part of my life and I just don't think I can just pretend it's not there and everything is fine. How can I move forwards with this?","It's hard when friends let you down.

It's a sad reality to face but there are plenty of people who are willing to listen to your problems regarding your sister & sympathise with them. Those people would be great friends for you. This forum is proof that there are caring people in the world. I wish you & your family well & hope you find some new good friends soon!","Thank you so much for your comment.

Thank you again for your kind and supportive words.","Ugh, it sucks to be alone with situations like this, but at the same time, if other people have not been through things like this themselves, it's a lot to expect them to understand it.Of course they want to ""say something"" but as you've seen, coming up with words that are helpful or understanding can be difficult for a lot of  people. My recommendation would be to not expect too much from your friends.  It's reasonable to want to talk about it with them, and hope that they'll be supportive, but on this particular topic, you've probably seen the extent to which  they want to engage (not much) so letting that be OK is probably going to be your best bet.If somehow they should find themselves involved in something like this in the future, you may see their tune change pretty quickly I think. , But yeah, I don't think you can expect much from people who don't really understand, which is a bummer, but probably just how things go, particularly if the folks you know aren't of the curious sort, or aren't naturally empathetic by nature. Good that you stopped in here though.  And I hope that you will in the future. And bummer that your sis is back in the hospital again.  It's good that she's safe of course, but it's gotta be wearing on her, as well as on the family I know.","Thank so much for your response and  I think you are very right! It is a lot to expect of people to understand such a complex disorder - but also to understand the complex ways families and friends of people with ED suffer too... I do feel my own mood and thoughts about it all change a lot too, sometimes I'm really angry, other times I feel very low and other times I can't really express how I feel. I can see that that can be a lot for someone with no experience of mental health to deal with.
I think you're right about trying to find peace with it too, and I think it is important to see the difference in intention when people are not wanting to engage vs trying to engage but not really understanding.
Thank you for your support! I appreciate it very much","Hi there. First, welcome. I am sorry that you have been dealing with friends who just don't understand and your sister dealing with an eating disorder. I am sure it isn't easy on you either. I know my sister's had trouble dealing with me and my struggles. It does seem that mental health issues are frowned upon more than medical but that is because they are so misunderstood. And often it takes a long time to heal from. They are so multifaceted. I encourage you to take care of yourself while you support your sister. Do you two talk?
I am sorry they seem to be putting you in a position of choosing them over her. It is painful to watch someone we love suffer when it seems ""enough"" time has passed. It has taken me a long time to get to where I am today. I wish I was completely in recovery. My roommate doesn't understand. She says things like, you have had enough therapy, you know what to do. I know she doesn't understand but it is still frustrating. NEDA has information on their web site that may be helpful for your friend's if they are willing to read.
I am glad you reached out. It must be scary for you to see how sick and how long your sister has been struggling and how her illness has perhaps overshadowed some of your needs. Please post again. iwanttolive","Thank you for your comment! Yes, me and my sister are very close and we talk all the time which I am really grateful for.... but I do think that can make it hard for people to understand too... obviously this illness can make her a difficult person to deal with sometimes and if I talk to my friends about that side of it they will say things like ""she's a nightmare"" and ""why do you do all this for her, she's not a good person"". That really hurts because even though the things she has done and put my family thought have been pretty bad but she is still my sister and I still love her very much. I think that complex relationship is really difficult for people who don't have experience of mental health to understand and can lead to those hurtful remarks.
I will always put my family over any other relationship and I think sometimes when I feel like I can't be friends with people anymore it's as much to protect my sister as it is to protect myself in a strange way... I just don't want people who say things like that to be anywhere near her.",,,,,,,
10,04/12/2020,HowcanIencouragemysistertoseekhelp?,"A year ago, in a bit of isolation and loneliness, my sister told me she had be purging for years. We talked through it and I naively thought the problem would go away. I recently learned she had a relapse this week. With Covid-19 quarantine she is stuck at home in the same environment in which her symptoms started. She is unwilling to actively seek help. In the back of her mind she want's to heal, but can't get herself to approach resources. How can I encourage her to seek help?",""".. my sister told me she had be purging for years. We talked through it and I naively thought the problem would go away…""First off, don't feel bad if you thought things would get better.  Things like this can be way more persistent than most people realize, and sometimes you just have to see it for yourself to understand that. Because yeah, it can stick around, and it can flair up again even if people seem to have recovered. "" I recently learned she had a relapse this week. ""  While you didn't say, I bet she isn't happy about it either."" She is unwilling to actively seek help. In the back of her mind she want's to heal…""Yep, both of those things can be true at the same time.  It's pretty common for people to have that sort of ambivalence.  Plus If she's had these same issues off and on in the past, she may feel like she's doomed to continue like this and etc.  Negative thoughts about their chances of really getting free of it. One thing that can happen though, is that people can start to catastrophise about their situation.  They have a past history, are OK for a while, but then they purge once or twice and think that means that they're doomed for this big relapse.  When really, they just purged a couple of times, which doesn't necessarily have to signal the end of the world. If things continue to seem bad for her, one idea you can introduce is the idea of taking a risk.  Sure, she could decide to see a therapist, and after working up the courage to do that,  the two of them might not click at all.   Or she could see some marvelous therapist, and even then she might not get well.  Or it's just possible that she could meet one that's actually helpful.  The truth is that there's just no way to know ahead of time, which gets back to the idea of risk-taking, and how she does or doesn't feel about that. Anyhow, if she worries that this relapse is going to be a persistent thing, the idea that she may need to take some emotional risks is one thing that you could bring up, if it seems like she'll need outside help.",,,,,,,,,,,,
11,04/07/2020,I'mnotsurehowtohelpmysister,"My sister told me nearly a year ago at like 3 am that she had been choosing not to eat for periods of time.That night I talked to her about going to see a therapist, and she told me that she wouldn't be opposed to it, she just did nOT want my mom to know why see was seeing a therapist.I told her that I would tell my mom she wanted to see someone for her social anxiety, and she agreed.I told our mom, very carefully, a few days later because I felt it was something necessary for her to know since I had been planning to move out shortly after. I told her that as far as my sister knows, she cant know, but I wanted to be sure someone in the house was aware.Long story short I didnt end up moving out, so now I still live with her. We share a room, and we recently moved to a new state. Shes not seeing a therapist anymore because of that, and she said she refuses to see another one because her last one wasn't a good fit for her.So that was the extent of it as far as I knew until a few days ago. I thought therapy and other stuff had been helping, at least a little, but I was..not correct in my assumptions.A few days ago we were talking at around 4 am, both of us drunk on sleep deprivation and being silly and dumb and laughing. When we were talking, I touched her leg because she had been pointing out something on it and then she panicked and broke down crying. I just kind of sat there because she hates people to talk to her or go near her when she panics or cries, and after a few minutes she calmed out and wiped her face and was like ""I'm fine""A few days later we went shopping and she opened up to me about it, and told me things that I hadn't been aware of before. She told me that at a time she had been restricting, and that she'd fainted several times when no one was home during that period.  She started eating more after she had fainted a few times, but even up until now shes still counting calories and wants to work down to a lower number.There's other things she talked about, like skipping dinner every other night, or how eating gives her panic attacks and I just like....I don't know that there's any way I can help her without losing her trust...and I think that's more dangerous...because at least right now she'll talk to me...We went around and bought some healthier foods that she'll eat (she's had sensory issues her whole life and cant handle eating certain foods due to texture) because I want her to be eating /something/ without her feeling horrible all the time. I asked her if we could make a deal that she'd eat more (and I could help her put together meals and stuff) if I would be willing to do workouts (mostly stuff like yoga) with her because I know shes concerned about losing weight but I feel like doing a daily, light workout would be...I dunno....safer?I'm lost on what to do. I can't be forceful about it because that never works. I cant make it clear to her that I'm worried about her because then she'll just hide it better. I have to make some sort of compromise because I'm the only one who is supposed to know...so I'm the only one who she'll even listen to at all.Our mother doesn't know about the newer things, and I don't know that I should tell her. She was willing to not go crazy the first time because as far as we knew it wasn't to a dangerous extent and she was going to therapy...but now it's a much different situation - we don't even have a doctor here at the moment.I know this post is all over the place, so I apologize, but I'm just....lost on what I can do.","Hey mothman, thanks for your post. We edited the post to remove calorie numbers which could be triggering for other users. You can review our community guidelines here. Thanks, and keep posting!","Ugh, EDs are really difficult matters.  Difficult for the person who has them, and as you are seeing, difficult for those who care about them too.  If there were magic words we could say, everyone would know about them now.  So it's just a tough thing all around, and part of our task is to try and tease out the positive bits, and see them as such.  And then see what we can do from there.You wrote :""A few days later we went shopping and she opened up to me about it, and told me things that I hadn't been aware of before.

So that's how I'd approach it if I were you : You already know the truth of the matter, and probably should resist acting as though there's something she can successfully say to dissuade you from thinking that it's not happening.  Because you do know.  And that's because she took the risk to tell you herself.  Which was brave of her, you know ?And it was brave, so I think it's OK for you to acknowledge that fact when the two of you talk.Because if she's going to get better, she's going to need to continue to be brave.  And I think that that's something you can legitimately continue to encourage.Anyhow, just some thoughts.  I hope you'll continue to keep writing, if it seems to help a bit ?Bob J.","Dear Mothman, you mentioned that your sisted fainted a few times. Fainting is a sign of a medical emergency that requires immediate medical attention. The following are just some of the signs of a serious problem that demands immediate medical attention:
Seek medical help soon on an outpatient basis if you:
We recommend that your sister seeks medical attention as soon as possible. ","As far as I am aware and according to what she has said, she had fainted a few times but that was around a year ago. As far as I know currently, that's not been a problem for a while as I've been with her most of the time for the past several months.I would like for her to get some medical help but at the current moment, we cannot easily access a doctor since we do not have insurance in the state we've moved to, nor do we have a primary care physician or therapists/psychiatrists to go to. That, in the wake of covid19, makes it difficult to get very far in that regard, but I have been talking to her about it somewhat.We've compiled a list of foods that she likes and that don't stress her out, and were going shopping for food for the next few weeks tomorrow, so I'm hoping to be able to get some things for her. She ate a few snacks we had laying around today so I know shes still eating something.As for what Bob said, I think you're right in some regards but in other regards its...less simple. My sister has trouble feeling empathetic toward other people most of the time. We've been told by doctors and therapists she may be on the autism spectrum or have something in a related circle but she hasn't been diagnosed. My other sibling is autistic, as is my grandmother so it's certainly not out of the realm of possibility.That being said though, her lack of empathy for other people at times makes me think that she would likely not...be entirely affected no matter what I did. I cant pull at the empathy of someone who can ignore it, yknow? To a point I've been able to get to that side of her, and I think it...bothers her that I'm concerned for her? But if I make it a bigger deal I've seen her switch it off before and in sure she could do it again.I'm walking the thin line currently of expressing my concern when were talking about it, but also of keeping up the joking relationship we've always had to avoid it getting too serious and her clamming up. And it's worked to an extent. She's willing to talk about it more often, on a daily-dish basis, and doesn't avoid it, so I'm hoping that I can start to be an actual help.","So, she has been eating the past few days, not a whole lot. I've informed my mom in some aspects, basically just telling her she should also keep an eye on her, making sure that she knows to make a point to buy food that she enjoys and to prepare things for her if she decides not to. I would like to see about getting to see a doctor sooner rather than later, and I'd also like to have a conversation with some of the psychologists we've seen but neither are really much an option right now with covid.I'm worried about her, obviously, and I think about it all the time... But it's hard to say if I'm overreacting to the things I currently know due to anxiety, or if I'm reacting exactly as I should be.It is 5 am at the moment so that could also be affecting my ability to think entirely rationally, ha.","Yes, I can see where autism could complicate things.  The other board that I'm on has a section for people with autism related conditions, and they can definitely have EDs.  I'm not very experienced in that area, but I imagine it can influence things.You wrote :""I'm walking the thin line currently of expressing my concern when were talking about it, but also of keeping up the joking relationship we've always had to avoid it getting too serious and her clamming up. And it's worked to an extent. She's willing to talk about it more often, on a daily-dish basis, and doesn't avoid it, so I'm hoping that I can start to be an actual help.""Yeah, you are definitely on the right track with your approach I think.  People aren't want to going to talk about it if they see us getting upset or freaking out.   At the same time, you continue to show that you believe it's a matter of important concern.  As you said, it's a delicate mix sometimes, but the fact that you can retain the part where you both know that you are friends is incredibly important I think.  That's the part that makes things feel safe, I think.As far as helping, just that she has someone to talk to…that counts as important helping right there, and maybe what our best role really is.  So I hope you can feel like you are ""doing something"" already. Because if she can talk to you, then you are, I believe. Bob J","I am hoping that, once quarantine is over and everything isn't so hectic out in the world, that even if she won't go see a therapist, i will be able to talk to mine and get advice from someone close to the situation.That being said, this forum has helped incredibly not only to soothe the constant worry, but also to help me know that what I'm doing may actually be of benefit and isn't just me making light of the problem or...whatever.If anything changes I'll likely post again, especially if she tells me something or we're still unable to see any doctors or therapists, but for now I'm going to try and keep doing what I've been doing and hoping I can be of some help to her.When it comes down to it i know i cant just do something to fix it, and shes going to have to come to terms with the fact that she cant continue on with this...but i think the fact that she recognizes that it's a problem is a good enough start...even if that's not stopping her.Thanks again to everyone. Hopefully my next post will be on the lighter side of this.",,,,,,
12,04/08/2019,Mysisterisevil,"I am really struggling to come to terms with my sister ruining my family. She has been ill for approx 12 years now, and I am at breaking point. I was still growing up when her issues began, and as she is my older sister, I assumed all older sisters were nasty, hysterical, violent, manipulative, and generally unstable. As I got older, this became quite obviously untrue. My sister struggles with lots of mental health issues, but the ones which manifest themselves most obviously are the anorexia and bulimia b/p. To preface this, I am well aware, all too aware, of the affects of eating disorders on the brain. I know she is not in control/her brain is starved, she does not choose to be unwell. Unfortunately, when it comes to my sister, it is not that simple. The fact of the matter is that before she even got ill, she was quite horrible. Now she is unwell, everyone says, 'oh, its not her fault, she's sick! poor her'. For starters, she was nasty before, so it's not all the illness. Second of all, poor her?! Poor my mum, poor my dad, poor me? My mother cries herself to sleep every night, my sister is very abusive to her and constantly tries to blame her and inflict pain on her. She is a nasty, nasty girl, and I don't know what to do. When people hear she is mentally ill, they immediately gravitate toward sympathy. I don't understand where the sympathy or understanding for family members who are under the complete control of the ill person is? She rules my family like a despotic leader, my parents are so scared of her harming herself that they will do whatever she wants. She steals, she lies, she abuses, and no one says anything. I don't know her at all. Before I was 10, she was horrible, and from the age of 10-21, she was horrible and mentally ill. It's incredibly hard to feel supportive, and in fact I no longer feel supportive at all. For a while, I tried to help her - for years, in fact, to have it thrown back in my face. She refuses to live with my parents despite the fact that they pay for everything as she dropped out of school, uni, and refuses to get a job. So now she is living with me - she leaves mouldy food everywhere, breaks appliances by purging into them, blocks my plumbing, makes me gets rats, and I have no choice because where else would she go? On top of it all, she is horrible. My parents don't want to get her committed as they fear she would hate them forever, yet her weight is lower than ever and she is very obviously deeply unwell. I am sick and tired of her and I am sick and tired of her abusing and manipulating my family. I feel horrible writing that I have given up on a family member, but I can't take it anymore. I just want to know that some other people have also reached the end of their tether. Please don't lecture me/say I am being mean. I don't have capacity for that.","Hello.  I am so, so sorry for you pain.   I get the feeling that you were probably also neglected as your parents have put all their attention onto your sister who doesn't seem to want their help, just their handouts.  You are not selfish nor are you being mean.  You are suffering and are in a lot of pain.  You are probably worried, angry, worried about your parents, feeling badly that you have been overlooked, correct me if I am wrong.  When a member of the family is so sick, often parent's are unable to let go and say no more.  Not no more love, but until the individual, your sister, is wanting to get help, to change, than something has to change.  I would like to explain my situation because I feel it is similar.  My sister pretty much lives in her room in bed.  I don't know when she eats or even goes to the bathroom.  She has ligit medical problems, but she isn't getting the help she needs.  She had been living at her house for twenty years rarely leaving her couch.  Then she moved in with me about two years ago.  She rarely leaves her room and now claims intractable pain, isn't eating, sleeping, so she says, and I am angry.  She never asks how I am doing.  She is very self absorbed and I am upset that my parent's allow her to do this.  for the better part of two years my sister has been a control freak, never contributing to household expenses, never cleans, everything is done for her.  Just recently she has been mandated to contribute to household expenses by our father who is our landlord.  There were such fights even though she hardly came out of her room.  I was ready to leave, but I can not afford to.  She doesn't listen to anyone even doctors.  My Mom is conflicted because of her medical issues.  I think they are doing too  much for her.  I know they are worried about her physical health but what they can not grasp is that they are hurting her more than they are helping her.  And I am angry.  I am told not to be, that I have a choice to be angry or not, but I am also afraid that she is going to die.
Back to you sister.  To have someone who is mean, cruel perhaps, running the two households and holding everyone hostage is not fair.  Does she have to live with you?  Can you find your own place?  It may not bode well with your parents but that is not your responsibility.   Right now you need to take care of you before you get sick.  People can take advantage of their mental illness and use it as an excuse, my idea.   If someone isn't willing or able to get the help they need someone needs to be called in and an assessment needs to take place to see if she is safe to be living by herself.  You can not take care of her.  You have your own life.  It is not fair for your parent's to expect you to, especially if she is abusing you.  That is not to be tolerated.  Mentally ill or not.  I am really sorry for all the fear you have lived with all these years, the years that were stolen from you due to your sisters illness.  Your own losses and confusion.  What do your other siblings have to say about all of this? Can you talk to a therapist and ask them what they think you should do?  Get help for yourself to talk about your pain and suffering?  You can't keep doing this forever.  She needs help and you can not help her as her needs are too great.I do not think you are being mean or selfish.  You have lived with all of this rage, pain, hurt, anger, seeing what is happening to your  mom, it is a lot.  Please continue to reach out and please let me know what you think about what I said.  You are not alone here.iwanttolive","After IW2L's note, it's hard to know what to add, but here's a few thoughts.These situations are abusive.  We are taught that abuse is when the person with the most power takes advantage of those with less power, but sometimes it's just the opposite - The person who casts themselves as ill or powerless is the one who takes the role of the tyrant. As westernized modern humans, we are also taught to believe that if somehow we manage to discover the proper response, and discover how do the right thing, that things will somehow work out in the end.  And if things don't work out, somehow it's because of our own shortcomings or even worse - our selfishness.  I'm not sure if other cultures see things that way, but others can use those beliefs against us.  When things are working out in ways that are ideal.Then there's the notion of personal responsibility, and responsibility as a whole.   And how it applies to our family and friends, and how it applies to ourselves.  So yeah, we try and be helpful.  We are trying to hold up our end of the bargain.  But when the other person seems not to be holding up their end, then what should we do ?And how should we feel about ourselves ?  And what do we owe our own selves ?It's a rough situation for sure.","Hi Sue, I've just joined the site therefore just read your post. As a fellow younger sister of an eating disorder sufferer I can absolutely relate. In fact your story sounds very similar to mine, at least at the beginning. Fortunately at the age of 21 and after 10 years of suffering, my sister moved away from our family and started her own healing journey. It came about after my parents threw up their hands and said she could no longer stay. It was the hardest thing for my parents to do, and it broke my heart to give up on my older sister. We didn't know if she would live or die, but we knew she couldn't stay and continue to destroy our family and herself.
She went through a hard road, but she is now much healthier than before. I'm not sure you can say she is free from mental illness, but her physical health is good and that has helped substantially with her mental health.
I commend you Sue for doing so much for your sister, for not giving up. You are a kind and loving person. From my experience though, the care you provide her may be allowing her to continue to manipulate you and your family and hence prolong her (and your suffering). She's not evil, this illness is evil and it's taken her over. It hurts me to say it, but you need to let her go. You need to show the illness that you will no longer let it control your life, and this will also show your sister that it doesn't have to control hers. Please have hope, and tell her to have hope, cuz it is curable, but it will take space and time and discipline on your part to commit to letting her begin to heal on her own (and with the help of prodessionals if she chooses).
My heart goes out to you girl, and to your sister. Good luck, let me know if you wanna chat more. Emma",,,,,,,,,,
13,10/04/2019,Howtochoosepathoftreatmentformysister,I've done some research on eating disorder treatment (anorexia is my sister's issue) but how do you decide which kind of treatment? My sister works full time and has kids. There are centers that seem unrealistic due to the expectation that someone will spend many hours there per week. I also looked at psychiatrists which seem more realistic (1 hour per week or however many sessions you want to pay for). How to make a decision where to start? Each option is a little different. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks,"Hi! Thank you for posting. We’re sorry to hear about what’s been going with your sister! We hope that you are able to get the support you deserve.

I am so sorry your sister is going through this terrible struggle, at the same time I am proud of you and want to say thank you to you on behalf of sisters who care enough to want to try to help their sibling.  As said, unfortunately we are unable to mention specific programs, but I would like you to consider something.    She is dealing with a life threatening illness.  Going into a partial hospital program my take her away from her job, for which she should have protection, and spend long days in therapy.  But if you look at the long picture, if it helps and she gets stronger, she will be able to be a better parent, and employee.  Eating disorders take so much from someone.  It is much like someone who is addicted to drugs.  Their only thought is how to get the next drug.  The brain is unable to function properly if not nourished.  Sound decisions, thinking clearly, just can not happen because the brain is malnourished along with the rest of her body.  So if she gets help now then she stands a better chance at weekly or bi-weekly therapy.  Unfortunately, it can be expensive to seek treatment, and it shouldn't be this way.  I am fortunate that I have Medicare and Medicaid and I can get therapy, but not with a trained eating disorder therapist.  But that is okay because I am in recovery and am back in therapy to help deal with an abusive family member and a family member who is young and may be going onto hospice soon.  But a therapist can help deal with underlying issues, fears, traumas, even if they don't specialize in eating disorders.  I hope this helps and thank you again for trying to help your sister.  Remember too that unless she wants the help, it limits what a therapist or treatment center can do.  Just a sad fact.   I wish you the best.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,
14,06/14/2019,whenwillitend?,"I have two younger sisters, they're identical twins and they both have been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa this year. They're fifteen. One twin is hospitalised at a facility for young people with eating disorders, and the other twin is recovering at home but she's too weak to go to school. They're both at different stages in their illness, but it's such a long road ahead that I feel overwhelmed by it all. I help my parents with both my sisters, but the way my mum in particular handles my sister (the one at home) and her re-feeding process/meal plan makes me angry. If my sister refuses to eat something, or cries, or shouts, or argues about a portion size/aspect of her meal, she reacts emotionally, will get upset, will try and make my sister feel guilty for being difficult, or will give into my sisters demands and change the meal according to her specifications. We got to family therapy and have all read books about anorexia, and she should know very well that this only fuels the eating disorder. My dad and I are much more on the same page. I ressent my mum for being so immature and unable to cope with my sister's illness. I myself am tired and I can't see an end to this. I plan every day around my sisters meals and her progress and I visit my other sister at least once a week. I've gone back on anti-depressants and I find work and school too much, let alone socialising. The twins' anorexia came out of nowhere for me and I'm still shocked, even though I've been living at home now for nearly two moths. When will things go back to how they were? When will things be like they used to? I can't talk to my parents about how I feel because I'm scared that I'll upset them further, and none of my friends understand what it's like to have a loved one with anorexia, let alone two loved ones. I just want someone to understand, I feel as if it has taken over my life and that it'll always be there.","""If my sister refuses to eat something, or cries, or shouts, or argues about a portion size/aspect of her meal, she reacts emotionally, will get upset, will try and make my sister feel guilty for being difficult, or will give into my sisters demands and change the meal according to her specifications. We got to family therapy and have all read books about anorexia, and she should know very well that this only fuels the eating disorder. ""As you've seen, it's hard not to get drawn into the drama of it all.  And how the whole thing can bring up issues of our own.  Which is what seems to be going on with your mom.   Instead of sticking with the plan, she's letting her own stired up issues get in the way. This is not to say that people should never get frustrated, because EDs can really be frustrating.  But your mom may need to take a look inside, and see why it's extra-frustrating for her.   To the point that she finds herself going off into areas that she knows full-well are not helpful. ""I myself am tired and I can't see an end to this. I plan every day around my sisters meals and her progress and I visit my other sister at least once a week. I've gone back on anti-depressants and I find work and school too much, let alone socialising.""No kidding, this sort of stuff can be emotionally corrosive, and effect everyone who's associated with it.  So you're right, we probably need to find ways to keep ourselves safe too. Which may mean setting some boundaries.  Practical and emotional ones too.  You may want to make some changes in how much time you spend interacting with the situation. Like maybe don't go to the facility, but write your sister a note instead.  Or take yourself out for a meal by yourself or with friends now and then. It would not be something to feel guilty about.   It wouldn't.  xx","thank you endlessly for taking the time to read and reply. I feel a lot of guilt because I'm the oldest sister, and my two sisters idolise me and have ever since they were little. We've always been very close. I left home for the first time last year to work in France, the job was part of my university degree, and I was away when the first twin was admitted to hospital. My parents told me not to return home and I was scared about not honouring my job contract/not getting college credit. My parents said that coming home wouldn't change anything and I was only 6 weeks away from the end of my contract. When those 6 weeks were up and I did come home, I found the second twin emaciated and my parents in complete denial about it. They'd been focusing so much on the first twin who was diagnosed and in hospital, that the second twin was left to her own devices. I spoke with them the second I was home from the airport, and only then did they get her referred and eventually diagnosed and on a treatment plan. So basically, this all happened because I wasn't there to see the warning signs. I play in a band that tours regularly and I work part time at a studio, plus school starts again in September. I'm torn between wanting to never be home, wanting to be busy all the time and forget about anorexia, and then feeling tremendous amounts of guilt for not being present and for making something about me when I'm not the two people suffering the most!",Response moved to the bottom of the page.,"Hi.  You said that if you were home this wouldn't have happened.  You are NOT responsible for what happened to your sisters.  You are taking on this burden and responsibility that you can not possibly bear.  It isn't your fault for living your life.  You have every right to be going to have gone to France.  You had no way to know your sisters would get sick.  Please do not own this as your fault.   I worry that you are thinking this.  You also can not fix them.  You can be there for them, but their recovery is their responsibility with help from their team as well as support from you and your family.  It is not your responsibility to carry the burden.  You can be a support, but not carry the responsibility.  I know I am repeating myself here, but I am trying to stress the point that you are feeling so guilty.  I hope you can lay it down.  iwanttolive","Hello and welcome to the forum.  I am glad you found us and have reached out for support.  I am really sorry for what you and your family are going through.  It sounds very painful.  Are you getting help for yourself to help you as you go through this with your sisters?  I had  various eating disorders for many years and am now in recovery and I have to say my sisters did not know how to cope or deal with me and my ""problem"".  I think it is good that you want to help your sisters but as BobJ48 said, you may need to reduce the amount of energy you are putting into your sisters, especially the one at home.  If someone isn't ready to get better and are being forced into gaining, there will be a lot of noise and fighting.  I never had to have family based treatment.  Didn't really exist when I was at my worst but even if they had this approach, I assure you, I wouldn't have cooperated.  This approach doesn't work for everyone.  It sounds as though your mother needs help understanding how to use this approach and not allow your sister, her daughter call the shots. That isn't how this approach is supposed to work.  It sounds like your sister is scared.  Most people with anorexia are terrified of gaining weight and need a lot of support while going through the process.  How is your sister who is in the hospital doing?  Do you think your sister at home needs inpatient?  Again, it is painful and so difficult watching loved ones go through this.  You also need support.   Especially if a lot of your parents attention is being put on your sisters you may feel ignored and angry and want your parents to see you as well.  It is not uncommon for siblings to feel this and rightfully so.  I hope you can find support and please, keep reaching out here for support.  I can tell you recovery is possible but it often times is a long road.  Recovery also can not be forced, it has to be something someone wants, and even then the process is difficult.  I wish you the best and will pray for you and your family.  Take care.iwanttolive and I am","first off, thank you for writing back. Just hearing from someone who understands feels amazing. I started the anti-depressants again because I knew that it would be a difficult time ahead, and I've had therapy in the past which has helped loads with my own personal issues with depression and anxiety. I go to family therapy at the hospital my sister is at, but I can't get say what I feel like I need to say with both sisters and my parents in the same room. now that I'm an adult, it's harder to get therapy quickly, but I'm on a waiting list. My dad is a lot better at managing his emotions and not giving into my sister at home. He and I work well together and he knows that I'm frustrated with mum's mishandling of the situation. Maybe together we can continue to talk to her about why certain aspects of her behaviours aren't helpful. My mum can get very defensive. ""How is your sister who is in the hospital doing? Do you think your sister at home needs inpatient?""
My sister in the hospital is making progress. She passed her restaurant family meal task today which means she's one step closer to being able to spend weekends back home again. I'm very proud of her! I think my other sister would recover quicker if she was inpatient, but that would be painful in its own way, and I want her to stay home. She's gaining weight even if she doesn't want to, sometimes it feels like theres two sides to her - the one who wants to go back to school and be her old self, and the one who's terrified of food and hates the whole family. thanks again for the kind words, I think this forum is going to be really helpful in the coming months","""sometimes it feels like there's two side to her-the one who wants  to go back to school and be her old self, and the one who's terrified of food and hates the whole family"".  Very well stated and so very true.  The fear drives a person with an eating disorder, anorexia, to be people they never were, to say hateful things, lie, and self destruct because of the fear of gaining weight.  I used to find safety in being underweight and there are issues that cause one to turn to an eating disorder and initially it is used as a coping mechanism but then the disorder takes over and the individual no longer is in control but the disorder is.  There is a lot hiding behind the fear of gaining or food.  That is why therapy is so important.  Could you write a letter about how you are really feeling and read it at the next family session?  It is really important for you to  have a voice too.  And it may help reduce your own anxiety and depression as well.  I am glad to hear your other sister's outing went so well.   Yay!!!!  Eating disorders are so complex.  They are very difficult to treat and recover from.  But...recovery is possible.  I recommend you reading through some of the other posts on the other headings so you can see the challenges.  I am trying to help some talk more about what is underneath their fears and symptoms, to talk about their fears as this will help the recovery process.  I was afraid to get better because I was afraid to live in the real world.  Hiding out in hospitals as horrible as that was was easier than living outside of them.  Then God healed me.  I am free from all behaviors and addictions and am getting ready to start volunteering to help those who suffer with eating disorders.

I just wanted to say thank you so much for posting this. My younger sister has been struggling with anorexia for over a year and I have gotten to the point where I can't live my life like this anymore.

I feel so sad, angry, and lonely as a result of her mental illness. I can no longer keep my feelings in so I am going to try to find a therapist.

15,05/01/2019,I’mstuck-longpost,"Hello, I’m new to this forum but I’m hoping that I could get some advice. My sister has been suffering from bulimia for about a year now. I’ve known about it for almost every day and I feel horrible. I don’t know what to do to help my sister. I should have stopped her earlier but I always thought that she’d be strong enough to stop on her own. It’s been a year now and it’s just gotten worse. I’m so worried about her health and I wish that I knew what to do to help her stop. I’ve tried talking to her but she just waves it off and says that she’s fine. My mother and I are trying to get my sister to agree to go to the hospital and talk to a therapist but she flat out refuses saying that it’s all useless. She already has cuts inside her throat, all that purging and laxatives have messed up her insides so bad that sometimes she has trouble breathing. My sister knows what bulimia does to the body but she’s become so addicted to purging she doesn’t know anything else.I know that my sister has always had a tough time with her body and after her major weight loss it just became worse. She believes that being skinny is the only way to be happy. She always tells people to love themselves but when I see her not loving herself it makes me want to cry. My sister and I have a lot of the same mental health problems and I went through a small period of purging as well, so I know how she feels to some degree but obviously I don’t know all because I have not been able to successfully talk to her about it.  I just want to be able to help her because I’m concerned about her body and her health. I feel bad sharing so many personal details about her but I really need some advice right now. I need to know how I should approach my sister about this, how I should talk to her, and how to get her to at least visit the hospital. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much.","Dear namuuu, welcome to the forums!

Thank you.,"Situations like this are difficult alright.   When the person feels that their behaviors are still benefiting them in various ways (even though they may know that the behaviors are toxic) it's pretty difficult to convince them that they need to take steps to change. So how do people define ""having a problem"" ?   The thought is that one needs to examine the effects that issue has on their life.   Social relationships, work and study, emotional and intellectual enguagment and flexibility - Negative  impacts on matters like that pretty much count as ""a problem"".  Not even counting the physical parts.  Perhaps your sister might agree ?Still, people can become so emotionally dependent on behaviors that they aren't really interested in changing.  of it they are beginning to have doubts, they can often feel that  ""I'm not sick enough yet"" or ""It's all that I've got"".  Thoughts which can keep people from fully confronting the issue and getting the help that they need. In any case, you might want to ask her to reflect on the different ways that her ED is effecting her life.   You're not going to be able to convince her yourself - These are conclusions she'll have to arrive at on her own.Another angle you might try is addressing the depression she is probably feeling.  She may not have mentioned depression specifically, but just to say, there aren't too many jolly bulimics.  She may not want to get therapy for her bulimia, but getting help for her depression might be an idea that she's more open to ?In any case, you're not alone in having these difficulties.  They can cause us to feel helpless as well, so you'll need to be sure to take care of your own self too, as this situation continues to play itself out.","Thank you so much for your reply. My sister does suffer from clinical depression, and she has an anxiety disorder. I do think that her anxiety disorder played a part in her developing an ED. My mom and I have tried multiple times to get her to agree to go see a therapist for her depression but she always refuses. The worst thing is is that she knows what her ED is doing to her health, she’s fully aware of it she just can’t stop. I just don’t know what to do at this point. Like you wrote, I won’t be able to convince her myself to have her stop but she’s become so emotionally dependent on her ED. She’s not trying to overcome it herself, and there’s nothing that I can do that’ll make her realize that she needs to stop. Honestly at this point I’d be more than willing to just force her to go to the hospital or therapy than have this continue for any longer.",,,,,,,,,
16,04/17/2019,Needingsomeinsight,"My sister has an eating disorder going on three years. The thing is, she isn't sooo bad. That's not me in denial. She's definitely too thin, she needs to gain some weight. But she doesn't starve herself completely, nor does she throw up - she eats, and she's been doing so much better the past 6 weeks. She's been eating three meals a day (I think), and isn't as concerned with what she's been eating. But now, she has the chance to be admitted as an in or out patient (not sure which at this moment) at a facility, and I can tell she's unwilling to go through with it. She wants to enjoy her summer. I want that for her too. But I want her to get better, first and foremost. But I'm not even sure if this is the kind of treatment she needs. The menu they provide seems to be less than what she's eating now. She's gained some weight in the last 4 months. Progress is progress, but I can see how hard it is for her to gain weight, on a physical level. How long does it usually take for someone with an ED to fulfill proper weight restoration? I imagine its different for everyone. Do you think she should go in for treatment? Because maybe if she remains diligent, she can recover on her own, with the support of myself and my parents.I also think going to a therapist is extremely important for her, so she can confront the body image and dysmorphia she's been struggling with for a long, long time. However, she's seen two, both of which seem to not really help. I think its about finding the right person. Would you recommend she talks to someone who has recovered? Like a sponsor of sorts? Where could she find help like that? She's been to a group session, but they have restrictions on what they can talk about as to not trigger anything. I get it, but I think she needs someone she can really be open and honest with, and someone removed from her friend group and family.I'm just so unsure of everything. I don't know how to be there for her when she complains about the way she looks. I try not to engage with that kind of conversation, but I just never know what to say or what the right thing to say is. Often, she gets mad and upset no matter what I do. She says that I insinuate that she looks ""different"" aka fat, if I refuse to engage about how she looks, or if I tell her to remember that she doesn't see herself accurately. I try not to take it personally, but I've been having bad anxiety and panic attacks afterwards. I've been very supportive, and she knows that I'm always going to be there for her. I tell her how proud I am of her, and how this is just another battle that she will conquer. But it's taken a big f'ing toll on me. I just feel so bad. I am constantly thinking about it, and I'm so worried about her.Any insight would be really appreciated.","Dear sistersforever, we would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove specific numbers.

Thank you and please keep posting!","If your sister has continued to gain, over a period of 4 months, that actually is fairly impressive. There's the eating and the weight of course, but the fact that she seems to have been able to persist with gaining for this long seems like the important thing.  One thing to remember though, often it doesn't take much for the person to fall back into their old habit.  Issues involving the theme of control can put a person back into a spin again. It's hard to say if she needs a program or not.  If she feels that it's not needed, and someone would have to force her to go, then that's something to take into consideration.  The control issue, you know ?  if it were her choice rather than someone else's, things would probably be better from the control angle. You are right about the therapist situation.  Finding someone who seems to ""get it"" is going to be important.  Talking with someone who's recovered themselves could help too. NEDA may offer something like that, and check their ""Help and Support"" tab above, as there seems to be some peer-to-peer forums she could access. "" if I refuse to engage about how she looks, ""  Good Idea !  You don't want to let her bait you into questions about appearance, because it's likely that nothing you say is going to be interpreted correctly.   ""You look fine"" actually means ""You look fat"".   If you say she looks thin, then you are only saying that to try and make her feel better, when what you really mean is that you think she looks fat.  There's no way you can win in conversations like this, so you're right about not allowing yourself to get involved in it !""But it's taken a big f'ing toll on me. I just feel so bad. I am constantly thinking about it, and I'm so worried about her.""   To be honest, this os how a LOT of people find themselves feeling, so don't get down on yourself if you find yourself feeling worried all the time. It comes with the territory it seems.  Frankly, people in your position often get therapy of their own, to help them to deal with the feelings they have, so if you find that these feelings are starting to get in the way of things, and are draining your energy in ways feel like they are taking a toll, it's reasonable to think about getting your own therapy to help deal with that.   Again, a lot of people do, so it's not something that's weak or silly to think about. You can keep writing here too, if it seems to help.Whatever the case, your sister is fortunate to have a caring person like yourself in her life.  Not everyone is always interested in understanding or being supportive, so you really are ahead of a lot of people in that regard.  xxBob J.",I really appreciate you taking the time to respond in a such an engaged way. I think finding the help that I need too is something I shouldn't brush off. Thanks a lot for your insight.,,,,,,,,,,
17,04/10/2019,Afraidofothersgettingeatingdisorders,"About eight years ago my sister began suffering from anorexia. I was the first one to notice that she had a problem with food. Her disorder was a horrible strain on our family, as I'm sure is normal for families of eating disorder sufferers, and I think it had a big impact on my development as a teenager. Today though, thank God, she seems to be securely in recovery, and is at a healthy weight. However, despite the fact that my sister and the rest of my family seem to have moved on, I have struggled with this. I live in a different state from my sister and family now, and every time I visit them I find myself having to fight to not monitor every food my sister eats and every time she exercises. Even worse, I struggle to not monitor the food habits of basically all of my friends. Every time I see someone exhibiting an unhealthy attitude toward food, dieting, or exercising, I panic and want to lecture them on creating a healthy relationship with food. And unfortunately, most women in their early twenties don't have a perfect relationship with food, which means I am panicking a lot. Has anyone else experienced this, or does anyone have advice for how to cope with this?","Dear SH,Oh boy, it really does seem like you were traumatized by your sister's situation.   No doubt about it, home situations, when someone in the family has an ED, can really eat into everyone's life !  Some people manage to get through these situations OK, but some of us are naturally sensitive, and things can make a bigger impression on us than they seem to make on others.   Our sensitivity is not a bad quality, and can serve us in good ways in the future, but yeah, we can pay a price for it sometimes too. Because when we have a family member with an ED, it's like what can we do ?  Our sense of control over our environment goes right out the window, which as I'm sure you know, can be a truly unsettling feeling, and in itself can leave us with some real sensitivities.   Sensitivities that can be triggered again, later in life.    To an extent where if we see other people who we think might be heading in a bad direction, it can bring up those panicky feelings again.  At the risk of getting all Sigmund Freud about things, these panicky feelings may somehow relate to the  feelings of loss of control that you had  surrounding your sister. I suspect your remember how unsettling those feelings must have been. Also, we all deserve to get proper attention when we are young, but when someone in the family has a problem, often they are the ones who get all the attention, while  other children are neglected.  Stuff like that can really leave an impression on us too, particularly if we are of an intrinsically sensitive nature.  Almost like a PTSD sort of thing, you know ?And really, we can't just tell ourselves ""Oh don't be so sensitive"".   We are who we are, and it doesn't pay to beat ourselves up about that.At the same time, no one wants to find themselves in a situation where they are being triggered all the time, so I don't think  your concerns are silly at all. Everyone is going to say ""Oh you should get therapy"", but they may have a point.  This sort of stuff is disruptive alright, and it wouldn't hurt to try and figure out what's really at the root of it, and then go from there.   Therapists who advertise themselves as working with trauma and PTSD issues might be the ones to check out.   Not that you were physically abused or anything, but more the part about how disturbing events can really stick with us, you know ?   In ways that really can cause us some legitimate emotional disruption. BobJ",,,,,,,,,,,,
18,04/03/2019,FindingtherighthelpforARFID,"My older sister (34) is suffering from an eating disorder and I am extremely worried about her.  She seems to be experiencing something closer to ARFID (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder), as she believes that she cannot swallow.  Her intake of solid food is non-existent and even swallowing liquids is difficult for her and takes a very long time.  This has been going on for 2 months and has resulted in her weight dropping extremely low.  I can go into all the long stories of ER visits and whatnot - but I am really just hoping that someone here might have experience with ARFID and found help.  I have been trying to find a place for her to go, like a residential program (we're in California).  Aside from the challenges of payment (she has medi-cal and I have yet to find a place that accepts it), many places focus on anorexia or bulimia.  I don't want to take her to a place where they can't help her, because I've already done that by taking her to two different ER's, and each time I feel like she loses trust in her family for taking her there.Does anyone have any advice for this sort of situation?  She just texted me yesterday saying that she feels hopeless and I am trying to stay strong for her.  I promised her that I will do everything in my power to find her help.  If you have any useful info, please help me keep this promise.","Boy, this sounds like a difficult situation alright, and it sounds like your sister is stressed by it too.   Plus the idea that her condition is associated with all those ER visits, that sort of mental association can't be helping matters either. I wish I could tell you what the solution was, as I'm not as up on ARFID as I might be, but from what you've said, it sounds to me like anxiety might be playing a big role in this ?Like that there are issues that she feels a lot of anxiety about, but those worries have now become displaced, and have become projected onto eating instead ?So maybe it's not really about food, per sa, but more about anxiety over deeper and more complex issues instead ?Has she given you any hints  about what those issues might be ?   While the eating situation is worrisome I know, maybe that's not what's  really at the heart of the matter ?Keep writing ?",,,,,,,,,,,,
19,09/17/2018,Understandingmysister/howtohelpher,"My sister has suffered with an ED and depression for many years and she hid it from myself and my family until a few years ago. She was admitted to in patient program for 3 months after she almost dropped out of school due to her ED and it initially helped. It has been a few years since she went to the facility or saw a therapist/psychologist regularly and since then, she has dealt with her ED and depression on her own and I would see her struggle but thought she was doing ok or knew how to handle her emotional upheaval from the therapy she received at the inpatient facility. I did not realize how much she was actually struggling until my girlfriend told me about the obvious signs, i.e. not eating consistently and being obsessive about what she ate, never communicating or being honest about how she was feeling, she would cry when we would go out to eat because she was not in control of her environment or what she could eat, and how skewed our sibling relationship was to an outside perspective. I did not recognize it but she often used me to deal with her emotional turmoil and I was always there to help her out and tell her everything was going to be ok. We never discussed anything serious nor did I ever confront her about her difficulties and not seeking help for them and I thought I was doing the right thing by being there for her. It is incredible difficult to tell her anything because I know how sensitive and emotional she becomes when we do talk about what she is struggling with and therefore I never confronted it. We also come from a family that doesn't talk about emotional issues and instead brushes them off and tries not to think about them and I am the only one in the family that she trusts talking to about her struggles. It has made both of us scared of confrontation and avoid difficult emotional discussions. I thought this was an adequate way to deal with her struggles, help her out when she was struggling, make her laugh and let her call/text me whenever she wanted, until it started causing problems in my relationship with my girlfriend. She would get angry and frustrated because I lacked the perspective to understand that my ""help"" was in turn letting my sister off the hook and leaving me emotionally drained and constantly worried about her well being. My girlfriend told me that I had to change something about my relationship with my sister because it was such a drain on our relationship and it wasn't a healthy way to deal with my sisters ED and depression. I decided, through my girlfriend's suggestions, to only talk to my sister once a week and let her know that she had to seek therapeutic or medical help because I couldn't always be there for her anymore. It was a drastic change to how we talked before but I felt that if I didn't do something drastic, I didn't think she would comprehend the magnitude of her issues and how important it is for her to seek help. It has been several months since I made this change and there seems to be little change on her part; I make sure to tell her she has to seek therapy or talk to someone else about her emotional struggles, even if it is a friend. I also make sure to tell her each week that she has to be more honest with me about what she is going through and if she has sought help. She is in school now and tells me that she is too busy or forgets to call counselors and I know it is her way of avoiding the issue. Each time we talk I confront her and she starts crying and shuts down and doesn't tell me much. I am just wondering what I should do? Do I not talk to her at all to let her know how serious I am that she seeks help? I am being too demanding when I ask her to seek help and not change much on my end? I told her that I will go to therapy too to help understand how to help her and change my way of dealing with confrontation and emotions. I want to keep talking to her but I don't know what to do and I am looking for help on how to talk to my sister and where to go forward from here.","Hi.  I think it is great that you are trying to help your sister.sibling.  I think what you are doing is good but I would try to not always be telling her your sister that  needs to see a counselor, as you have already told her many times.  I think if you make yourself available on the day of the week you speak she may be more open to sharing if she isn't shutting down the conversation because of the mentioning of the need for therapy.  She knows what she needs.  No one can force an adult to get help.  Even a minor will not open up unless they want the help being offered.  So, you are doing a great job.  Thank you for caring for your sister.  I think once she knows you aren't going to be on her case about counselling, she may be more open to it is her decision and she doesn't feel she is doing it for someone else.  And she may talk to you more openly. Best of luck to you both and please let us know how things go.   I am sorry it has been a few days that you got a response.iwanttolive","Hello BotanicalCo23,
You’re situation is very similar to mine.  My sister has been struggling and ED for at least 10 years but she hid it well from the family because she has other health concerns that mask when her ED is taking over.
How has the advice you received on this website and forum helped you?  I’m not sure how to speak to my sister without starting an argument every time we speak. She’s trying to control the way we communicate and my responses to her. She’s openly telling me I want you to speak to me this way not that way, but I don’t think it will help her. I feel like I need to be tough and somewhat motherly but she is telling me she wants me to keep it very light and not discuss her eating disorder. I feel like ignoring her illness and avoiding the subject is the wrong thing to do, but she wants me to trust that she is aware of the steps she needs to take to recover and just keep the conversations superficial.","Hey there,You wrote :""I feel like ignoring her illness and avoiding the subject is the wrong thing to do, but she wants me to trust that she is aware of the steps she needs to take to recover and just keep the conversations superficial.""Just some thoughts, but my  guess would be that your approach  would depend on if she actually is trying to get better or not.  If she seems to be making progress, then ""normal"" conversations that help her  remain in the world (rather than her withdrawing from normal day-to-day interactions ) can be of help, I think.  But if it seems like she's not getting better, and simply want's others to avoid pointing that out to her, so she can proceed with her ED unchallenged, then thats' probably another thing altogether. How does her attitude towards recovery seem to be ?   People can be mindfully aware of all the ""steps"", but if they are not making a good-faith effort to take them, and accept professional help when it's offered to them, then it's pretty easy for things to just stay the same.","Hello BobJ48,
I’m getting mixed signals about her attitude toward recovery. Which is why trusting her is difficult for me. Her eating habits are improving but we don’t live together so I can’t be sure if she is purging when she gets home after dining with me. She refuses to go to a doctor or counseling which I think is necessary. As I mentioned, she has other health concerns that affect her diet and weight so in my opioin skipping doctors appointments is a terrible choice.","Sissy,It's not uncommon for people to truly want to recover….but still find themselves unable to do so. So if it sounds like you are getting mixed signals, it may be a reflection of those sorts of difficulties.  I'm not sure it means she is untrustworthy as a person, but she may feel a lot of shame about her feelings of helplessness , and ""to spare you anxiety"" may not always be telling you the whole story. ""She refuses to go to a doctor or counseling which I think is necessary. ""I think you are right about this. People with EDs can be in real trouble, and know that they are, but at the same time, don't like the idea that they might not be in control.  Which when you think about how EDs are supposed to be about being in control…maybe you can see the conundrum they are up against .  Going to see a doctor or counsellor….they can feel that doctors or counsellors aren't going to tell them anything they don't already know, or devise other sorts of mental rationals for not going. So yeah - They can come up with a lot of reasons to avoid confronting their situation, kind of like we all can sometimes.    Because there's a part of them that can believe that there really is no hope for them.  So why bother going ? Which is not really true.  People can get better, but I think they need to admit that things really are out of their control, which can be a very hard thing to do.   For any of us, really. So yeah, at some point she's going to have to be willing to take some risks, if she's going to get better.  Seeing a doctor or ED specialist - Those are just the sorts of risks that she may need to take for herself, if she continues to find herself out-thinking her situation.","I am very new to this which is surprising because my sister is 65 years old. She has always been extremely thin since she was in her 20s but it wasn’t until a few days ago that I received a diagnosis from a team of doctors that she was suffering from both anorexia and bulimia and has been for about the past 30 years.My sister and I have been extremely close our entire lives and I feel like she is my soulmate and we can talk about anything. But her eating disorder is something that never even occurred to me. She would always tell me that she has a very high metabolism and she eats lots of food but she just couldn’t keep on any weight. I have to say that she is so painfully thin you can see her spine and bones protruding from her body.Our year ago she had major back surgery and had a 10 inch rod put in her back for what we all thought was stenosis of the spine. The surgery failed  and ever since then she went on a downward spiral mentally. She suffers from bipolar 1  and OCD. Over the years her mental illness has been managed quite well but the past year she has been in such extreme pain physically which led to her downward emotional spiral into deep depression.I always assumed that we could talk about anything because we always have. I come from a family of six siblings and she and I are the only two that are close. The other siblings are not close to her at all,  because my family has a hard time tolerating her personality based on her constant complaining about her physical pain and depression and also the fact that she alienated most of my siblings many years ago because of things she has said that were hurtful to them. But my relationship with her has always been unique in that we just get along so well and accept each other no matter what.  I must add that I am very close to my siblings and my mother so I feel fortunate in that way but I cannot talk to them about her because they have animosity toward her and so I feel helpless and without support even though I do see my counselor regularly.  I have bipolar and depression also and so we can always relate to each other and have always supported each other throughout the decades. We spent much time together and laughed and always had a deep connection to each other unlike any other I’ve ever experienced. We even know what the other is thinking without even saying anything.After her failed back surgery a year ago, she has been depending on me more and more  in times of crisis, which at times could be multiple times a day. At first I would try to help her by listening to her and hugging her and telling her everything would be OK but it got to the point where I started suffering emotionally because I couldn’t handle it anymore. I am a highly emotional person and I also have borderline personality disorder so I started struggling to the point where I was having breakdowns over her problems and realized that I needed to set boundaries for myself. So at the suggestion of my counselor I implemented some boundaries as far as when I was available to talk, consistently reminding her I was not equipped to deal with both her major problems as well as my own, gave her multiple contacts to call, reminded her to see her mental health doctors, etc. but she would keep crossing those boundaries or not doing any of the things I suggested. I also should add that she has been noncompliant with psychotropic medications over the years also because she claims that the side effects are too severe. So as a consequence to that she has lost many psychiatrists  because of their frustration with her.  So therefore she depended solely on me for crisis intervention on a daily basis and after six  months of that I literally couldn’t take it anymore so I set a boundary that we can have a relationship but I can’t talk about her issues anymore. Her issues being her depression, her financial  difficulties, her severe pain, etc. Nothing I ever said to her helped in anyway.  She saw multiple medical doctors and none of them had any answers.  Fast forward to about two months ago and it finally reached a point where  I had to reach out to professionals to learn how to cope with both loving her and being angry and resentful that she was putting me into the position of being her sole emotional support, which I am not equipped to do. I have my own issues and I also I am under the care of a psychiatrist and a counselor and do very well but I cannot handle someone else’s major issues as well as my own. Because my sister lived alone and was begging me to help her and telling me that she couldn’t eat because her throat was so irritated and acid was coming out and her pain was unbearable and none of her doctors were helping her and she didn’t know what to do anymore I finally had to reach out to the police department and the officer told me that whenever she had a crisis I needed to call for them to do a welfare check. So the first time that happened, a couple months ago, I did that and she was sent to a mental health facility but she quickly got out after 24 hours saying it was a horrible place and they didn’t understand her at all and it made things worse. Then she would go back home alone and the next day be in crisis again and reach out to me again and I would try to talk to her and give her suggestions and advice which she would not take.   So what ultimately happened is that in the last two months I have called to have a welfare check for her about four times and each time they would put her in a mental health facility and she would get out after a couple days and be just as bad or worse. It finally got to the point where the county had to intervene and she was placed  under their care through the court system and was required to go to doctor appointments and if she did not then she would be placed in a psychiatric facility against her will. She failed the first appointment but they did not check on her until four days after her missed appointment and when they went into her house they found her emaciated,  disoriented, with heart palpitations and found out she had not eaten in a week. So they placed her in the hospital to get her hydrated. After that she was placed in a locked facility for the past 10 days and I was not allowed any contact with her at all and it was breaking my heart in pieces because I just wanted to comfort her but I knew it was for the best.   The facility told me that this is their protocol because when someone is in such physical and mental distress it is imperative that they get acute care without the intervention of family members at the beginning so I understand that completely. I got a call finally yesterday from her team of doctors and they determined that they did a full evaluation and diagnosed her with  both anorexia and bulimia and it is extremely advanced. I almost fell on the floor in shock.  I didn’t know!!  How could I have not made the connection? On Friday they are putting her in a assisted living facility to get her stabilized physically and then after that they are putting her in a special facility in another part of the state that specializes in mental illness and eating disorders.  This was such a shock to me. I never ever considered over the last 30 years that she was anorexic. She always told me that she wished she would gain weight but said she was eating a lot of food (which I never saw her eat because she eats at home alone) and she felt terrible that she was so thin but that’s just the way it works and I took her word for it because my four brothers and my dad are thin also And over the course of the years I have seen them eat a lot and still remain thin because we do tend to have a high metabolism in our family.   To make a long story short, my sister is now going to finally get the help she deserves for her anorexia and bulimia in a place that specializes in those areas. I am holding out hope that she will improve enough so that she can get back home again eventually but I realize  it might take a long time or it may never happen. What I want people to take out of my comment is that even someone you were extremely close to for many years, you can be completely in the dark about the fact that they have an eating disorder.  This is the first time I have ever known someone with an eating disorder so it is all new to me  even though I have seen documentaries on the subject. So if anyone who has a loved one who is suffering from anorexia or bulimia or both, please know that it was nothing you did or didn’t do that may have prevented them from getting proper treatment  and there was nothing you could have done to fix them on your own. I realize now that what I did for her by continually calling for welfare check was the best thing I could’ve ever done for her even though at the time I thought I was being a monster.  No she is in a safe environment where they are starting the  process of treating her eating disorder. It will start with her admitting that she has an eating disorder and then it will go from there to actually treating the disorder itself.I am trying to stay very  hopeful that she will gain some weight and get better. I also know that the statistics show that someone her age who is been anorexic for three decades are not very good but I will never give up on my sister. My heart goes out to all of you who are  struggling to help your loved one. I have found that only professionals can help a person with an eating disorder and I am sharing my story because even though I had to take drastic steps to finally get her the help she deserves it was the only solution.  Trying to convince a loved one that they have an eating disorder and need help for it is futile. Getting professional help for them is key. Good luck to all of you and you are all in my thoughts and prayers.","Hi.  I just wanted to check in real quick to see how you are and how your sister is doing since your last posts.
Please feel free to post anytime to get support for yourself.  Take care,iwanttolivepl",it is very difficult for my sisters and my parents to hendle me whenever i get a stroke! :(,"Feelsohelpless,
 Thank you for sharing your story. My sister hid her eating disorder very well for about 15 years. I’ve been feeling very guilty For not knowing the signs that her eating disorder was out of control, and sometimes I have trouble sleeping. Your story is helping me to see that many people with this this disorder are very good at hiding it and avoiding help to overcome illness.",my sister was 20 when she got eating disorder and it was very tough for me to hendle her!,,,
20,03/13/2019,Feelsohopeless,"Hello and welcome to the forum.  I am so sorry to hear about your sister and your story.  Thank you for sharing. You did an excellent job at explaining what you have been through with your sister.  You are correct in saying you are not to blame.  I understand you may feel ""how did I not know?""  But your sister was clever in lying and deceiving all.  You did the right thing in getting her help.  It is up to HER to decide if she is going to keep up with what she will learn in treatment. You are doing what is good for you in setting boundaries.  Boundaries are a sign of love believe it or not.  It forces the one who is ill to utilize the help that is there for her and will help keep your relationship healthy.  You are correct in saying you are not able to carry her and you.  As difficult as it has been for you to get her the help she needs, you did the loving thing, even if she is angry with you for it. I am really proud of you for loving your sister enough to do the difficult things you have done for her, and for yourself.  Please know we are here for you.  I am glad you posted.  You have been through a lot and as you said you are both older and it makes recovery a bit more challenging. I am 51 and after thirty plus years of suffering am now in recovery.  So it is possible. I relied on my faith in Jesus and my parents support and my friends.  So.  Again, I am glad you posted and shared your story.  Please let us know how things go.  Take care,iwanttolive","Everything IWTL said above is the truth.  I know it must have been difficult to call the police on your sister, and to know that they were taking actions that were likely traumatic for her.  That can't have been a comfortable time, I know. But as you've seen, she had reached a point where she was unable to take care of herself, and where others needed to take over.Hopefully things will go a bit better for her now.  If they can bring her nutrition up, people's thinking and mood often improves.  You may find that's the case with your sister. And really, BPD is no picnic, so it's really admirable that you've been able to look out for yourself in the manner you have. While it may not seem like it at the moment, I hope you'll be able to give yourself a pat on the back at some point for dealing with this situation in a manner that's finally brought your sister the help that she needs.   xx",,,,,,,,,,,,
