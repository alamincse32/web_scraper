I find myself constantly questioning if we are doing enough to help her.  Is there anyone who is working on recovery with a child that would like to keep in regular contact?

If we're doing the right things to help them. If we're doing the wrong things. Too much. Too little. It's so hard to know. The good news for you us that your daughter is working to recover. The other side of the story is that recovery is not a straight line. There are many ups and downs, steps forward and steps back, bumps and curves along the way.

Like you I continually wondered if I was doing too much, not enough, questioning myself constantly. We always had a good relationship, but I learned that sometimes I had to breathe and listen. The mom in me just wanted to dive right in and fix the unfixable. I'm sure you understand the frustration that mindset causes both you and your daughter. I'm glad your daughter is working on recovery. Keep up with therapy and meds. Family therapy helps a great deal too. It helped my other daughter and myself become supportive without smothering. Family therapy really offers a safe place where everyone can communicate and carry forward those skills at home so you don't feel like you're walking on eggshells all the time.There are things that come up that my daughter will take offense to and that I had no idea would bother her. But she brings it up via conversation or text, calmly helping me to understand. I can't stress enough how important it is to listen.Take every day as it comes and do your best to take care of yourself too.

1,DoodleLvr,02/25/2020,Need parental advice,"Hi, I ‘m new to this community but not new to ED.  My dd has engaging in behaviors for 5 years, been in residential 2x-the most recent was this Jan. She went in under her own will(she’s 19), but left AMA after 30 days. She suffers from bulimia and periods of anorexia.  She was wanting to get better when she left res last week, saying she was just very lonely there and that was her reason for leaving AMA. She is in IOP now (started last week after a day home) and individual therapy but there’s always a reason why she can’t go.  I am Just so sick of living in this world. I know shes engaging in behaviors again because the upheaval has already begun in the house. The combativeness, the inability to have any conversation that isn’t 100% positive and rainbows and ends with her arguing, blaming and then isolating again.  I just Don’t know what to do. She quit her job before she left for res because she was too ill and it wasn’t safe. She doesn’t go to school because of the anxiety. She has no friends (LITERALLY) because she has pushed everyone away. There’s not one consequence that I can think of to make her go to iop and therapy because there is nothing left. She has no money, no car and depends on us 100%.
Please help with suggestions. I’m open to ANY!  And also would just like support and to know I’m not the only parent suffering like this.

Find something you enjoy to help you keep your sanity.  For me and my wife, it is going to the gym or walking the dog (which, ironically, is also a stressor b/c our daughter gets upset when she can't go also).

2,bracal,08/17/2019,Mother grieving child lost to ED,"I am the mother of a 20 year old young woman, who was at one time vibrant and alive, unafraid of anything! A year ago she made a serious suicide attempt that brought to light the depth of her eating disorder, substance abuse and other mental health issues, depression, anxiety etc. She was hospitalized then we used the only leverage we had (her dance training program funding) to force her into a 30 day residential treatment. She hated it but complied with treatment recommendations because she wanted to dance. She got out of treatment and went into a step down program and continued an intensively outpatient regime for another 6 months. She resisted and hated it the entire time. Long story short, it kept her alive and now fast forward, she has graduated her preprofessional program and has come home while planning for her next adventure. We moved in the middle of all of this and she is isolated here. She just started a job and is saving up money to relocate to a big city where she can pursue her career.  Living with her has been exhausting. My mental health is a mess, I'm crying all the time, feel lonely, lost, powerless and hopeless, am depressed, anxious waiting for the next episode or suicide attempt (she has days where she cant function and just wants it to be over- I talk her off the ""ledge""). A very big part of me feels horrible because I just want her to leave, to move out and get on with her miserable life somewhere that I don't have to bare witness in this push/pull dysfunctional relationship. She does not want help. The less she eats, the less I recognize her. This is not the child I raised. I barely even like this person. It is the hardest thing in the world to feel this way about your own child. We almost lost her and here I am wanting her gone, I never imagined I'd feel this desperate.I don't know how to help and I no longer know how to take care of myself in this situation. My husband is equally struggling but the way he deals with it pushes us away. Our marriage has been impacted as has our relationship with our other adult son. I truly feel like I am grieving for the child (or maybe my ideal of that child) I lost a year ago.

3,WorryParent,02/14/2020,Is this Eating Disorder?,"Hello,My daughter who is 10 years old has been having complaints of abdominal fullness since August last year.  It wasn't affecting her eating then.  Started in October, the complaint seemed to have grown stronger and she wasn't able to eat her school snacks, but still finishes all her food.  In December, it got worse to the point she started eating less at dinner and complaining she feels really full.  Dinner was a big struggle, she still managed to finish all her breakfast and lunch.  Up to January, daughter couldn't take any food at all, she says she feels really full all the time.  She is also experiencing constipation, she also experiences headache when she feels really full.  We have done all kinds of tests, x-ray, CT scan, endoscopy, ultrasound, upper GI test, blood tests, all have come back normal.  She was admitted to the hospital 2 weeks ago, tube feeding was started on her as she was malnourished and lost lots of weight over the months.  She is experiencing severe symptoms towards the tube feed.  We were told the symptoms should get better over time as she adjusts to the feed, but after a week, she is still feeling awful.  She experiences burning in her throat, pain in her chest, stomach, fullness and sick feeling in her stomach, nausea but not able to throw up, she also burped lots.  She felt really distressful with the tube.  When offered the food, she is not interested at all.  Doctor diagnosed her as eating disorder, but I believe there is still an underlying issue going on that wasn't detected by the tests, but what's going on shouldn't really stop her from eating, is what my daughter experiencing considered a form of eating disorder?  Is eating disorder only limited to wanting to look good?  She is not the type of girl who wants to look slim.  I wanted to help my daughter but don't know how.  Should I get a second opinion on her fullness feeling?  She said the full feeling is not the same as a full feeling when you eat lots of food.  When she has a bowel movement, she does feel a little better. Any advise you can offer would help, much appreciated!",BobJ48,"Wed,02/19/2020-4:38pm",Worried.,"First here's the disclaimer about not being doctors and all that.   I can't really give you informed medical advice and etc etc.Having said that, I'm with you in still wondering if this is a medical issue.  Not so much because of the symptoms you mentioned, which do indeed sound serious, but more that you didn't seem to bring up a  lot of the psychological issues that often define eating disorders.  Which you probably would have seen and been aware of, if in fact it was  formal anorexia.By that I mean, not simply a concern with the fullness and the physical symptoms she's having, but a noticeable phobic adverson to eating at all.  Specific foods that seemed taboo, an obsession with the caloric content of foods that were offered to her,  confused assessments about what she sees in the mirror, concerns about clothing which may or may not fit, obsessive daily weighing, looking at pictures of thin people, and making overt comments about feeling fat. Generalized personal dissatisfaction and a lack of self-worth.   Along with losing patience and getting angry at  the efforts of others to feed her.If you were seeing a lot of that sort of emotional expression,  even at her young age, then folks might be correct  in suspecting an eating disorder. But from what you've said, it doesn't sound like like you're been seeing much of that at all ?This is not to say that people won't try and hide their EDs, because often they will.  But if things get to the point where people have to be hospitalized, usually some of those emotional signs have begun to show themselves already, in ways that would have gotten your attention. Even so, it wouldn't hurt to have her talk with a therapist who is experienced in eating disorders.  A good one would know the right questions to ask in order to tease the real answer out.  Much more so than a general practitioner would. As far as how to help your daughter goes, expressing sympathy with her distress is the best way to go I would say.   Because none of this sounds enjoyable to her at all.Bob J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,dontknowwheretoturn,01/02/2019,Orthorexia,"I'm in a place I never thought I would be.  My daughter has a disease which I just don't understand. I'll give you the basics and see what advice you can give me.  I'm 100% in her corner, I just don't know whether to press issues or stand back.My daughter is a Div 1 athlete.  She has been diagnosed with orthorexia.  (only eats clean foods).  This started in HS. She is now a Junior in college.   It started with only wanting to eat healthy foods.  The sport was an easy coverup (as she explained to us recently).  We truly had no idea.  She's maintained a fairly good weight throughout all of this.  Things took a bad turn this past summer and we finally strongly encouraged her to see the athletic department's nutritionist who in turn referred her to the psychologist.  She's been going to therapy for about 5 months.  She's open with us and is really trying.  She has gained some weight and does look better (her eyes and face aren't so drawn and tired looking).  Her athletic performance shockingly hasn't been affected by this disease.  I don't know how it couldn't have been but she had a great season this past fall.  My husband and I were looking for signs of lack of fitness and strength but she was the most fit of any athlete on the field and one of the strongest.  So, she's been home for the first time for an extended amount of time for the first time in a couple of years.  She's eating a fair amount of food but no foods which are outside of what she considers healthy. Should I be pushing this or letting it go?I know that she had a really rough time with her ED when she first came home but seems to have settled in a bit better as the break has gone on.  But still not eating anything outside of her ""clean diet""  Anyone have any experience with this?  This is how the whole ED started.  It got bad with restrictions and excessive exercise this past summer but while I wouldn't say she's eating to excess, she's still not eating a lot.  Excessive exercise is difficult to moniter as she has a program that she needs to follow from her coach over break which is pretty intensive.  She is open with us and is on medication.  It's difficult to know if she's making progress or if she's just holding steady .",BobJ48,"Fri,01/04/2019-9:46pm",Orthorexia,"Orthorexia can seem like a strange thing alright.  It's hard to fault the things they eat, but the fact that the person is so mentally effected and constrained by their obsessions - That's where the issue is. You probably have figured out by now that ""safety"" is a big part of this.  If a person is going to ""stay safe"" it's going to involve some fairly rigid personal control.  Which is one of the themes which ties it in with the other eating disorders.  The exercise thing can also involve themes of control and safety as well.  And really, who among us doesn't hope to feel safe and in control ?  So there really are some potent emotional themes here that she'll need to be aware of, and see if she can experiment with letting go of some bits of the sort of rigidness that's involved.You mentioned that she was able to be open with you about her situation, so that's a positive thing right there.  Has she been able to tell you what she wishes she was able to do ?  These are difficult matters, but If so, that's probably a start.",lovetowrite81,"Fri,01/18/2019-2:47pm",Hello!,"Hello-So glad that you decided to post here! I struggled with orthorexia nervosa throughout high school so perhaps I can offer something that is somewhat helpful. I honestly look back and my parents didn’t really know what to do. My mom was so scared, I found out later she was sneaking stuff into my 'acceptable' food to increase the amount of calories. But otherwise, she did not push me towards eating any particular thing and for the most part just encouraged me to seek professional help I needed. I started seeing a therapist for the first time- and began getting at the underlying root causing my ED. It didn't happen overnight but over time, my need to cling onto ED behaviors became less and less. It is a process. But what ultimately led to my recovery was my own inner work- learning how to identify my emotions for the first time in therapy and beginning to develop my identity outside of the ED. As much as you care for your daughter and want to help, my instinct says that ultimately her recovery will happen on her own timing. I know that as much as others tried to be helpful and encouraging, if I wasn’t ready to eat certain things, I wouldn’t. Breaking out of the good food/bad food mentality takes a lot of time and happens gradually. I honestly think the best thing you can do for your daughter is just continue to be a safe space for support, continue to foster the openness in what she’s going through and be there to listen. You can support her but it’s ultimately her fight. And it seems like she is on the right track with seeing a therapist & is putting in the effort. And it’s awesome that she is able to be open with ya’ll and will be super important in this process.Keep us posted on how your daughter is doing and how things are going.

She's still not getting enough calories and is working out with her sport which is excessive by non-NCAA athletic standards.In my mind, I think she is at a dangerous crosspoint.

She also suffers from anxiety which makes this all the more difficult.",brokenhearted,"Sat,07/27/2019-5:13pm",orthorexia?/anorexia,"I have a 22 year old daughter with ""orthorexia"".  Just under two years ago, my daughter, also a college athlete, began to lose weight during her sport season.  I paid an out of state visit to her to evaluate the situation that was brought to my attention by her roommate.  At that time, I didn't notice any big change.  A month later, her father paid a visit and he did not see anything alarming.  Her coach mentioned nothing to us.  When she came home for Thanksgiving, the weight change was visible and I took her to the Dr. for an eval as my daughter claimed that she was not ""trying"" to lose weight.  Of course, labs and visit were all fine.  I had a serious talk with her and nervously let her go back to school.
When she returned, she was in worse condition and I was frantic, as were my friends and family.
After naively deliberating about what approach should be taken, the athletic department and I agreed to let her return to school under the supervision of weekly Dr. visits, weekly therapist visits and bi-weekly nutritionist visits.  The plan was to dangle a carrot to get her to improve... that she would be able to train and compete if at a healthy weight.  Dr. was not happy with the slow progress and recommended hospitalization.  She spent 4 days in the hospital and was compliant, released and back to the same level of care. This was my window of opportunity to take her home and get her in the proper level of treatment and I didn't.  The ED demon convinced me that she could recover with this level of treatment and with that carrot dangling in front of her.  She has now experienced all levels of treatment except inpatient, with some improvements that never lasted. She has reported that she faked her way through every level of treatment that she has ever had. She has now graduated from college and we are back to square one. She has actually become more restrictive with her diet, leaving out an entire ""unnecessary"" food group. I used to like to call her illness orthorexia because it sounded more dignified than anorexia, but the truth is, it's a glorified word for anorexia and it's just as evil.  Her father and I are divorced and he doesn't recognize the seriousness of her condition, so all eyes are on me as far as what happens next with getting her to seek some kind of treatment.  I am praying that she hasn't comfortably nestled into this anorexic lifestyle and that there is still some hope for recovery.  As many of the other parents in this forum feel, I am haunted by this disease on a daily basis and just want my daughter back and for her to have a chance for a normal, healthy life.  At this point, I am praying for God to show us the road to recovery. I beat myself up each day, thinking things could be alot different if she had gone straight to inpatient treatment when she returned from college in rough shape.  From what I have read, the anorexic habits that were developing, along with the brain changes could have been treated before getting worse.  Maybe this information can help a newbie make a decision about early, intensive treatment from the get go...",iwanttolive,"Sun,07/28/2019-8:10pm",brokenhearted,"Hello.  I am sorry to hear about your daughter.  I want to let you know that I am not a mother, but I have one.  I had a life threatening eating disorder for thirty years.  My parents did what every parent does, their best.  When a child suffers from a medical condition, there are usually clear cut answers from doctors as to how to go about a course of treatment.  Unfortunately not so with eating disorders.  There is a lot of confusion and not so good advice and not so good treatments out there.  I know most parent's second guess themselves and say.....if only.  Well, that is a really difficult way to live and blaming yourself isn't going to help you or your daughter.   I encourage you to try to accept the decisions you made as the best ones you could have made and that ultimately it is up to your daughter to choose if she wants recovery.  I know when one is malnourished the person isn't thinking clearly and when in an addiction making wise decisions such as choosing to get help is compromised, but it is still a choice.  I was afraid to get better and even though I was hospitalized twenty-seven times, some for a year, six months, four months, two weeks; and then the day programs, half way houses, I finally was able to commit to recovery.  I am fourteen months free from the disorder.  I owe a lot of praise to God for His help in getting me to this place.   And a debt of gratitude to my parent's who stood by my side for all those long and difficult and challenging years.  My Mom second guesses herself, if she had given me more ultimatums, if she had been more this and less that.  She did what she knew to do at the time.  Looking back helps no one and certainly not your heart.  It sounds like you really love your daughter and would do anything to help her.  That is loving.  May I ask, are you taking care of yourself now.  Living in the present?  Looking back with the If onlys….isn't going to help you. I am glad you reached out for support and hope your heart heals.  Take care and God bless.iwanttolive and I am  PS  I just read over a part of your post that read: I beat myself up everyday.  Please don't.

What I would give to have my daughter back again...",holdingon3,"Tue,02/18/2020-3:54am",I feel like I have to do this alone,"I feel for all of you going through this.  Unfortunately, with all the ""healthy talk"" in schools and online, our children are getting mixed messages and I believe untreated eating disorders are the result.  My 15 year old son was a healthy eater and active sports player at 10 until his pediatrician reinforced that he was ""on the high end of the chart"" right in front of him not understanding the bitter feelings he already had for his muscular body.  He immediately lost an enormous amount of weight by restricting specific foods.  By the time we realized what was happening he stopped so we didn't seek any help.  However, low self esteem, OCD, and body dismorphism led him back to anorexia and last spring (of 2019).  When I called his pediatrician and explained he was fainting, had blue fingernails, rapid weight loss and extreme thoughts of depression, he saw that his ""number"" was still on the accepted scale (albeit low) and said he ""looked alright"".  Needless to say this did not help.  When I took him to an eating disorder clinic the next week they said the opposite.  His heart rate was low and he was in an extreme state.  However, his conformation was in two days, something he had worked for for a year, and he is a very spiritual person, and the medical doctor would not treat him there and wanted him to check into the local emergency room (where they do not specialize in eating disorders).  I knew this would traumatize my son who has an eating disorder BECAUSE of underlying issues and we left defeated.  I lost a really important window of help and now he is entrenched in this lifestyle.
     It has been a year and he has not gained any weight. I finally went to a therapist for myself and at her encouragement came ""clean"" to him that I was adding calories to his acceptable foods, but I didn't tell him the extent. My son and I have a great relationship and I feel constantly like a liar.  However, now I can see his body fat percentage getting even worse.  I finally have an appointment with a new doctor and pray to God that this doctor will see the health struggle we are going through for what it is and partner with my son to get him to see that what he is doing to his body is not healthy.  I feel like people reinforce his orthorexia all the time and this makes it harder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,Ladysen02,09/22/2019,Mistake to admit?,"I am having a lot of trouble wrapping my head around my daughter being admitted to residential. She came to us one night amd said she needed help and showed us that she had started cutting. We noticed this summer that she seemed to be thinner but weren't too alarmed since she was so active this summer. End of August,  she passed out on the toilet and admitted to her therapist that she had been restricting for a while. We contacted the recommended facility who had her doctor order tests. They determined she needed residential treatment.  She dropped a significant amount of weight in a short time. Her problems up to this point had seemed centered around anxiety and stress from issues in her life. Now she's been in the facility for 3 weeks, it seems she is worse. I am so worried that i made the wrong choice and that she is learning more bad things than healing. My academic head says she needs to be there but my emotional brain wants to take her home. Has anyone had these worries? Did we admit her too soon? Am I making her worse by being admitting her?",butterflying,"Tue,09/24/2019-6:16pm",Hi Ladysen02,"I'm so sorry to hear that your daughter had to go into residential and the fact she is dealing with this disorder, but at the moment I'm very sorry that you have to go through this too..

6,rawlih,02/01/2020,Refeeding programme - cannot get my daughter to do it,"My daughter attended an assessment at Eating disorders unit on Thursday. They said that her physical health is a cause for concern and that she needs to do a refeeding programme. They then gave us a sheet showing how she should increase her intake. Basically said "" make her eat it"". clearly this is not happening as she has an eating disorder!!!!!All that has happened is that she is even more conscious of what she is eating and so consequently decreased her intake. I am not at all convinced that this is the right strategy. They have also said that she cannot do any exercise or go to school. This is having an extreme effect on her mental health and I now feel that things are so much worse than when we asked for help.Does anyone else have any experience of how they were helped at the start of this process? They have basically said to me - make her eat it  as it's her medicine or we will take her into hospital. If I could make her eat I would not be in this position.She does not believe that she is that ill.Please help us to know what to do. Should we just allow her to carry on as she is now for a few days until she can be seen again on Tuesday or continue to force the issue knowing that it is making her eat less.",seren,"Wed,02/05/2020-2:23am",re feeding,"Dear Rawlih, It is so tough and worrying when you start with this.

If we manage to get her to eat one of the items on the food programme she just then refuses the next meals until we give in - this involves several hours of saying no and hysterical crying. Today she is refusing to get out of bed so that I don't make her have breakfast. I spoke to her support team who just say if you are worried take her to A&E. BUT even if I could get her there they just say yes your blood sugar is low. They make her eat a ""disgusting"" drink till blood sugar comes up and then they send us home.She then refuses to eat the next meal.

I am glad you posted looking for support.  I am sorry this happened.  Although I can not say for sure how things should have been dealt with, I would have felt better if it was discussed with you the parent's before talking with your daughter without you knowing about it.  I am not a parent but a daughter and my parents had to do a lot of advocating for me.  The doctor may have felt that your daughter is old enough to know what you her parents are thinking, but I would have preferred hearing it from my parents and not a professional as it would make me feel trust issues were involved.  You may be feeling some of these things.  What do you think about talking with your daughter when she calms down about what happened?  Ask for her input so she feels she has some control in the situation.  Also what to you think about talking with the doctor who was involved and maybe having a family meeting to figure all this out?   I really don't know much more and I really am not supposed to give advise but this is how I would and do feel when my parents talk without my knowing to any of my doctors.  But she is still a minor.  I am in my fifty's.  So it is different for me now.  But I was always very sensitive to my parents talking about me with any doctor even when the doctor said this was going to happen. I would get mad.  So.   What to do now....as I said, maybe talking with your daughter explaining why you did what you did...or having a family meeting to try to learn how to best deal with situations in the future.I hope this helps.

9,Andrea84,01/19/2020,13yr old daughter refusing to eat,"My 13yr old daughter has been having issues at school, with an ex friend targeting her about her weight, making comments, calling her names. Last september she stopped eating as she said she wasnt feeling well. Her blood sugars dropped and she was admitted to hospital. The drs put it down to viral as they couldnt find anything physically wrong (all her symptoms were things they couldnt really check-headaches, dizziness, blurred vision). She refused the syrup to get her blood sugars higher, and the nurses had to be quite firm with her. She eventually started to drink it.
All seemed to calm down at school for a while. Then before christmas quite a bit of food was vanishing and she denied it was her. I have found all the wrappers under her bed.
The girl has started making comments again now and my daughter is now refusing to eat. In the last week she has been eating very little. Another incident on friday happened and she is now refusing to eat anything at all. She is barely drinking. I took her to hospital last night. She was refusing but we managed to get her there. Her blood sugars are low, hands and feet are cold, headaches and tiredness. They were going to admit her but decided to let her home and said to monitor her, if she faints or goes dizzy to take her straight back, and to make sure she drinks as she isnt drinking enough. Shes now refusing water too. She is so emotional then switches to really angry. Its like theres just a shell of her at the moment. I just dont know what to do. The more i try and push even just drinking she refuses even more. She says it makes her feel better when she doesn't eat.

10,iwanttolive,01/11/2020,brutus94,"Hello brutus94.   I am just checking in because I saw  you responded to another's post.   How are you?  Your daughter?   Your family?   How are you holding up?  I know it is very difficult and I am just wondering how you have been.As for me, things have been very difficult in my family.   My sister is critically ill.  She may die, but then we don't know when or if it will be today or next year.  It has been very difficult for my parents especially.  My father isn't coping very well with all he has had to endure with all his girls.  Five in all.  Four of us are on disability.  As I wrote in a post today, he and my mother have had to deal with their children's spouses and boyfriends abuse, physically, emotional, verbal and sexual assault as well as a grandchild being taken away from their daughter, my sister, when he was two.  That is an entire story in and of itself.  There is suicide, and violence and on and on.  Then dealing with the eating disorder that nearly took my life and the decades they fought to help me overcome it.  I still struggle with things, especially as things escalated with my sister, and then my moving in with them about six months ago.  My father isn't coping very well and is very shut down emotionally but using some poor coping behaviors that have me concerned.  He is angry and doesn't want to admit that he is scared about the possibility that my sister, his daughter may die.  The family has not been in communication with another sister/daughter going on six years now, until she realizes she needs help, but then there again, he says he is fine with this and life goes on.  He holds very strongly to the fact that he just doesn't need to feel, he just moves on.
I don't know if you  as a father would have any perspective on this or if you might give me some ideas in how to support my father as he goes through this.  He gets angry with me, tries to control me and when we have discussions he needs to control them or else and he gets very defensive.  One confusing thing is that my parent's want me to follow my therapists advice, unless it pertains to them and what goes on in their house where I live, or in the house where I was living with my sister, and will be going back to eventually.  It is three houses away from theirs.  My Dad owns both and we pay rent to pay the mortgage.  I love my Dad and he loves me but he is burnt out.  Cooked.  Really tired.  He is going to be 80 years old in July.  Most people think he is in his late 60's.   Both my parent's are young for their age.I hope you don't mind my sharing all of this with you.  I just need a father's perspective of having gone and going through serious daughter issues and how I can help my father.  Thank you either way.  I understand if you are unable to respond.  I hope things with your daughter are a little better.  Did she go to college?  How is she doing?   Take care.iwanttolive",iwanttolive,"Mon,01/13/2020-10:08pm",hi part 2,"Hi.

I decided to move back to my own home three houses away.  I was living with them for six months or so and I know he needs his owns space back.

She did not go back to school for spring semester as we are still holding out $$ until she gets the help she needs.  The physical demands of the nursing clinicals would just be too much, and we were hoping the life disruption would get her attention.  Of course, she is free to spend all her own money to go back to school (I'm not blocking the door), but she choose not to do that on her own.  She is (slowly) making some progress toward seeking help, but there are a few hurdles to clear.  The residential program she wants to go to (yes, that is HUGE) won't accept her until she is a little more ""stable"".  So right now I am trying to remain patient and supportive.....God help me.  Now, here is my ""dad perspective"" for you.  I only have 3 kids and I am 30 years younger than your dad, and I don't have a lot of the traumatic life-altering problems you described (just one kids with an ED).  But I can already feel ""fatigue"" setting in.  It is not just because of the ""difficult"" kid with ED, it is a combination of MANY things.  Parenting is a huge responsibility, one you don't fully understand until you are there.  And it involves sacrifice.Knowing what I know now, I can empathize a bit with an old guy who may be shutting down a bit and just looking for some peace and quite.  It's not a lack of love or emotion.  It may just be a struggle to manage feelings that nobody really understands.

11,welostdaughter,01/09/2020,Our daughter lost the battle,"Hello,
I am new to this site and only found out about it through the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC). I never really cared about what to donate to until now. We lost our daughter just a few weeks ago from complications with her bulimia. She had been fighting valley fever for about a year and a half and due to being malnourished, her body could not fight it anymore. A healthy person can usually fight it off in about 2-3 months.
She was a beautiful 27 year old girl who was very talented at writing and drawing. She lived with us several times over the years and we had just moved her in to her own apartment in November. She has been fighting this disease for about 9 years. We have had her in many treatment programs over the years, none of which she liked but she knew it was necessary. She did have dreams of success and had dreams of becoming a mother. We had those same dreams for her.
My main reason for leaving this message is to help people become aware about how serious this disease can be. I am still mourning her loss and still in disbelief that I will never see her beautiful face, hear her witty jokes or her laughter, enjoy her big hugs, or get her birthday cards (which she always told me that I was the best dad in the world and I was her hero).
My wife and I are going to start an awareness group and start fundraising campaigns to shed light on the whole issue, in the name of NEDA. We were always just focused on her and if we had started something like this sooner, my daughter would not have liked that kind of attention.
For all the parents out there that is dealing with a child with a eating disorder, I want to encourage you, plead with you, not to give up and always try to get your children the help they need.

But sadly, the ED has sucked alot of this joy from her life already.  I know she can get better and have an amazing life.  Then at times, I feel like I have to prepare myself for the worst.  The emotional tug of war is relentless, and it is terribly hard to talk about.Thank you again for sharing and encouraging others.  Today I will choose to be grateful for the opportunity to help my daughter fight and recover.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,fittsfamily,01/06/2020,PHP Alternatives,"Hello all,I am new to the forum and really all of dealing with ED.  My 15 (now 16) year old daughter was diagnosed in October with atypical anorexia and after 3 weeks in hospital was moved to residential treatment.  She is improving greatly and we are getting ready to have her come home at the end of January.  We are unable to find a treatment facility for her to receive PHP level care that is near us in St Louis Missouri.  There is one center that takes adolescents but unfortunately does not take our insurance.  The cash day rate is not affordable.  She has already spent 10 weeks away from home.  Are there any alternatives to PHP level care that anyone can suggest?   I am a nurse practitioner and although this is not my specialty I feel like I could handle providing the structure she needs and build in her therapy, manage physician care, etc accordingly.Thanks for any assistance!Fittsfamily",iwanttolive,"Mon,01/06/2020-9:46pm",fittsfamily,"Hello.  I am so sorry to hear of your pain and your daughters struggle. I am a daughter of two nurses!!!  They got me help when I was your daughters age and continued to advocate for me over the years.  They got me on disability and Medicare because they knew it would be a long road and I am thankful they did.  I am not sure if I am allowed to mention this, but have you heard of Family Based Therapy?  It is where they teach the parent to help the child learn how to eat.  Basically taking over all food prep and meal times.  They have therapist that teach parent's how to do this.  There are also books on it, but it is best to work with a dietician and a therapist to help guide you along the way.I am glad you are so invested in helping your daughter.  Without God and my parents, I wouldn't be where I am today.  It took me a very long time to reach a level of mostly recovered.  I had fifteen months of strong recovery but had a little set back but am doing well again for the most part.  I wish you the best in this journey.  I also want to recommend that you get help for yourself if you feel you need it as it is very difficult to watch a child suffer.  My sister is critically ill and is on Palliative Care, currently in the hospital where she has been for about four or six months out of six or eight.  I forget how long it has been.  Three states, four or five hospitals.  My mother has been at her side most of the time.  My Mom is 77.  Going on 78.  So it is so painful.  It was also difficult watching me be so ill.    They had gotten help before when I was so sick.  Something to consider.Please feel free to post anytime and welcome to the forum if I forgot to mention that.   I am glad you reached out.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,iwanttolive,10/26/2019,brutus94,"Hi.  This is iwanttolive.  We posted back a while ago.  I am so sorry to hear of the seriousness of your daughters condition.  My parent's got POA when I was very sick.  The difference is I acquiesced. I knew they needed it and my life depended on it, so I let them.  Now that I am better, it is in a locked box and they will not use it unless I need help, but I do not think it will be necessary anymore for the eating disorder but if something else comes up and the need it I will give them verbal permission to use it again.  You worry that if you use this form of protection for your daughter that your relationship may go beyond repair.   That may be, but if it saves her life, and she understands why you have done what you are thinking about doing, once she returns to a state of thinking rationally, she may thank you.  She may not.  That is the risk you have to take.  I can not tell you what to do.  She may decide she doesn't want to get better no matter what.  But I think it is important to find out why she doesn't want to get better.  What she is afraid of in getting better. What that means to her.  I would want those questions answered before the eating disorder takes her life.  Harsh words.  Takes her life.  But I think you are living with that fear and are fighting perhaps more than she is at this point for her to survive this.  Have the counselors said anything about this to you?  You fighting more than she is, or is capable of?  I am really sorry for the pain you have in your heart.  The destruction this blasted eating disorder and attachments have caused your family.  It is insidious.  Ugly.  But given a chance, and getting your daughter to a point where she wants to try again, she may just have a fighting chance.  And then comes the faith part.  That is how I finally got better.  My prayers are with you.iwanttolive",brutus94,"Mon,10/28/2019-12:50pm","You understand, my friend. ","You understand, my friend.  Honestly, the POA sounds like the ultimate sledgehammer that a parent can use to ""fix"" the issue.  But.....I think you nailed it when you said you acquiesced.  YOU acquiesced.  POA is no guarantee that she will actually participate in anything.  To be honest, I'm not even sure if a treatment facility would hold her against her will.  And if they did, they can't force her to do anything.  My fear isn't that she will hate me, my fear is that it will cause her to dig in deeper just to prove she can win the battle of wills.You also nailed it when you said that her mom and I want her to get better more than she does.  I really thought that we could bend her using financial leverage.  She HATES the situation she is in.......and yet nothing changes.  Currently, she is in denial and thinks she will be returning to school soon.  It is a complete lack of reasoning, coupled with an ability to excel academically.  Sadly, she is just not getting the help she needs.  I don't know if it is lack of ""will to get better"" or if we just haven't found the right resources, or both.",iwanttolive,"Thu,10/31/2019-10:23pm",brutus94,"Hi.  How have things been going since our last post?  I think what you said about the two intersecting intruders here are the not wanting to get better for whatever reasons, and the not getting the right help both work hand in hand.  For me, for decades, I did not want to get better even though I told people I did, told myself I did, and went into hospital after hospital.  I was afraid to get better.  To be an adult.  To be independent.  Fear of not being able to support myself, work enough to support myself.  Hold a job down.  Fear of men and relationships.  Fear of being me.  So many fears.  Then through a miracle,  was healed at a women's retreat.  This was fifteen months ago.  Before then, I was working on recovery, but fifteen months of very little use of behaviors.  Some overeating.   Due to enormous stress and dealing with the abuse by my sister and the fact that she is seriously ill and face the fact that she may die, I did overeat for about two weeks.   Overall I am doing very well.  Still not totally independent, but that is okay.  Interdependence is much better.
So.  There are some valid reasons people are afraid to ""let go"" of the destructive eating disorder.  For me, I have been able to trust God and talk with my Mom and some friends and am reaching out to help others, which helps keep me in check.I say this to help you understand why your daughter may be afraid to let go of the disorder.  I don't think we want to be sick, but being well is sometimes scarier.  I thank God for helping me heal and I continue on the journey every day.I was just wondering if you have made any decisions and how you are doing.  I know how difficult it is for parent's to watch their child die.  My parent's have had to deal with the fear of my dying years ago, and now my sister and her possibly dying.  Not easy.  But we have One we can lean on and He promises He will be with us and grant us wisdom.  He will and He does.  Leaning on the Everlasting arms.iwanttolive",brutus94,"Tue,11/05/2019-9:29am",I feel like the parent at a,"I feel like the parent at a sporting event that is ""overly animated"" because they want their kid to succeed/win.  I have always prided myself on not being that parent, the one that wants the success more than their kid does.  Supportive, yes.....over-bearing and living my life through my kids, no.  Yet, here I am desperately wanting my kid to recover.  Sitting of the sideline of life screaming (or wanting to scream) motivational cliches like ""Come on, is that really the best you can do?"".  Agonizing because she is losing friends and missing time away at school.  She has a terrific scholarship to a Christian college that she just feel in love with right away.  It was a perfect fit.  And yet, she could not hold up her end of the deal we made regarding health and our tuition help.  So I ask myself.....is this really God's plan at work?  Wow, the time we can spend wrestling with that one.You are a spiritual person, so I will share just a bit more since we are as well.  I know God can save her, but I also know He promises salvation and nothing more.  No guarantee of a long prosperous life, no guarantee of a miracle cure.  And I need to accept that, because salvation alone is enough.  So for now, I guess I am really praying that God moves her to open up and be honest with someone about her feelings, to confront the fears, to have the difficult conversations.  We are also working to find another counselor/therapist that may connect better and achieve this goal.  Because I am convinced until that happens, no amount of arm-twisting, financial bribery, or verbal persuasion by me is going to move this child forward........and certainly not at the speed I would like.  It is likely she will be home again spring semester, but we will see.",iwanttolive,"Tue,11/05/2019-12:35pm",brutus94,"Hi.  Thank you for sharing.  I really understand what you are saying.  God's perfect will and permissive will.  Really tough to figure out in times of illness.  My Mom especially is dealing with this with my one sister who is medically and psychologically ill.  She lives in her bed and her life is in danger.  She was in the hospital about four months in three states.  She agreed to go to a rehab to get stronger but checked out.  My Mom continues to make doctors appointments and my sister cancels.  So today she cancelled and my Mom said this is it.  She needs to want to do these things and my Mom is a cardiac patient and is not doing well emotionally at the thought of losing her daughter.  But again, we can't want it more for them then they do.  I want to go over to the house and scream at her, but that won't help anything.  My Mom promised that if she backed out of this appointment then she is done.  I am not sure she is capable of stopping trying to help but I think this is it.  My Mom had a catheterization and then a large stint put in her main artery.  She had three small strokes during the catheterization.  She has not suffered from these but I am not sure.  She has been so emotional and tired.  She spent days and nights at the hospitals for weeks right after her procedure.  She NEEDS to stop or she will get sick.  She already is with anxiety and fatigue.  So, I understand what you are saying about wanting to help but also trusting God and handing our loved ones over to Him.  Oh I have tears in my heart right now.  Painful tears.  For you, for my parent's, for me, for all of us who have to deal with the wreckless choices of those we love.  My father was prepared to bury me.  He is prepared to bury my sister.  I am so sorry for your pain and suffering.  God wants your daughter to make the better choice, but He gave us free will.  Tough one.  I know.  Anyway, I will be praying for you.  Let God hug you.iwanttolive",brutus94,"Wed,12/11/2019-6:16pm",Update...,"Well, the tide may finally be turning.  The financial leverage of no tuition and no car is sinking in and, along with support from friends at school that want to see her return, are motivating my kid to pursue treatment.  Residential treatment.  She found a program she wants to go into, and it is in our insurance.....it seems perfect.  The one obstacle in the way is that she first needs to either go to inpatient for a few days, or improve to the point where she meets the residential admit criteria.  I really hope this works out.  It is the first time she has initiated a plan for getting help.  I will check back in a few weeks.

14,iwanttolive,10/02/2018,For Mothers and Fathers,"Hello.   My name is iwanttolive.  That is my user name and is very significant because I didn't always want to live.  I very much wanted to die. I was very ill.  I was just talking with my mother who says she suffers from PTSD from living through my illness.  She just told me how she was thankful for when she checked on me that I had a warm body.  How terrified she was of my self harm and not knowing if she would get a call from the police.  How fearful she was of the nights I would walk the streets fearful of me not making it home.  The thing is is that I never realized how sick I was.  To this day I don't remember being that sick.  I was hospitalized twenty-seven times, ranging from a year to two weeks.  Day programs, half-way houses.  I know how your hearts hurt, how you want your child of whatever age to be well. I want to encourage you not to give up on your ""daughter"". It may be a son.  I am now fifty.  I am walking in health.  I no longer self harm.  I do not engage in eating disorder behaviors.  But I know the pain and agony and fear you live with as my mother has been honest with me, about how scared she was.  And then again just a little while ago, she shared again, giving me a deeper revelation of how much she suffered during my illness.  The fear she lived with.  Not knowing if she was making the right decisions about how to handle me and what too do with me.  She told me just now that she was thankful I was warm.  How last night she saw someone walking in the dark and she had a flashback of me walking the streets in the neighborhood late at night, worried I'd be hit by a car or worse.  I didn't know the level of fear she lived with.  That you may live with.  Watching me self destruct while she was not able to help me.  I am sure there are some of you who can relate with what my mother went through.  On behalf of my mother I apologize to you for the pain I've caused.  The sleeplessness nights.  The fear.  Lost time.  I want to offer encouragement as well.  I am walking in recovery.  I have been recovered from the anorexia for at least three years, and the self harm and overeating for just under five months.  I know it isn't a long time, but I know it is real.  I have been going through some very difficult times and serious difficulties in recent months and have not had any urges to use any of my behaviors.  I know my faith in Jesus is a big reason for this breakthrough and healing, and the love of my parent's.  Without Their help, I wouldn't be alive.  I am living my life now.  I am happy even though I am going through a storm right now and have a level of depression and severe anxiety, I am also happy, or have joy.  I want to encourage you to share with your daughter how you feel.  Share if you are scared by her behavior.  How it affects you.  Not to shame her or make her feel guilty, but to let her know you love her and are scared.  My heart breaks for my Mom and what she went through with me, but we rejoice together now that I am well and am able to help others.  To offer Hope and say that even the sickest of individuals can get better.  I am living proof of that.  Don't be angry with your daughter.  But let her know you are there for her.  If you are able, let her know she can come to you and share how she is doing and what is going on.  It was hard for my Mom to hear what was in my thoughts.  My thoughts were sick and scary.  No mother should have to hear what my mother heard.  But she stayed by my side and didn't give up on me and I am here today to say recovery is possible for anyone.  On behalf of my mother, thank you for all you have done for your child.  Adult child.  For your love.  If the relationship is damaged, do what you have to do to repair it.  It the eating disorder has broken trust, caused friction, hatred, do what you can do to heal.  Your child most of the time isn't doing this to hurt you but she is lost and hurting and suffering.  There may be anger.  Hateful words.  Dishonesty.  This is difficult.  I know and understand.  I just want to say that after decades of being sick, I am now able to be on the other side and see what I did and how much it hurt my parent's especially my mother.  I love my Mom.  She is my friend.  My hope is that you can see past the behaviors and see your child as a person.  Not an eating disorder.  Look at her in her eyes and let her know you are there for her.  She may reject it at first.  Keep at it.  No one is hopeless.  Don't give up hope.  From my heart,
iwanttoliveMonths later.  Today, June 7th, marks the one year anniversary of no behaviors.  No self harm and no eating disorder behaviors.  I have been out of therapy for about four months, something I never thought possible.  I am very involved in living and am happy for the first time in since I can remember.  I celebrate this weekend.  So it is real and recovery is possible.  Never give upIt is now going into my fifteenth month of recovery, with a two months or so dealing with overeating, but not binging.  There has been a lot of stress and dealing with some abusive behavior with a sibling.  My home environment has not been easy.  Now my sister is probably going to be going on hospice in the near future.  All that being said, I have made choices to help keep myself on track, getting more support for myself and am back with my parent's for a while.  I say all of this to say that even during some very challenging times, I am doing what I need to do to maintain recovery.  With God's help.  I know you are worried about your children and adult children.  My parent's are dealing with health issues with my sister and have to learn how to help or not.  It is very difficult for them to know what to do and I know you must be feeling similarly with your children.  It isn't easy.  Loving them may be difficult or they may reject the love, but deep down they probably just want to know they are still loved.  I am not saying you don't, just from my experience I need to know my mom and dad love me.  And they do!!!  I am alive and well because of them and our mutual faith in Jesus.  Take care.

That can be really important, even if you went with her initially to make sure the fit is good and then being able to know what is going on inside her that is causing her to turn to the eating disorder.  Family support especially at her age is so important.  She may respond with anger but know this is the eating disorder talking. The eating disorder wants to keep her and take her down, but your love and support will help keep that from happening.  If she rebels or gets angry, try not to take it personally.

You are already inspiring me so much and you are new to our community but welcome. You are right in saying that when your daughter says things and may yell and say hurtful things to you it is because she is scared. Scared that her only way of coping is being taken away from her.  But therapy will teach her better ways to cope so she won't need the eating disorder in the future.  That is the goal.  And as I have said, I had an eating disorder a long time before I realized it was hurting me and my family and I was not living.  It is possible to be free.

There were many signs and I have been very worried. I finally confronted her and she confirmed all of my worst fears. I am working on getting her therapy right now and she is totally open to it and not fighting me at all. My issue is she is supposed to leave for boot camp on Jan 14 2020. I talked to her about maybe going to the military (she is joining the Air Guard) might not be the best thing. She signed up before she graduated high school in May and has just been waiting to go. She said if she doesn't go she does not know what she will do. She has been waiting for this and I am afraid if she doesn't go it will make her spiral out of control. If the Guard finds out she has an eating disorder they will kick her out and joining the service is all she has been planning for. I just do not know what I need or should say to help her. I have suggested she also join a forum of people that are going through the same thing she is. She feels so alone and she says she is just exhausted constantly fighting the demons in her head.

17,brokenhearted,09/22/2019,Complacency Stage,"I have entered a new stage as a parent of a 22 year old with an eating disorder.  She has been through various levels of treatment that she has deemed worthless and any progress that was made, has not lasted.  She has graduated from college, lives back at home, actively job searching and working a low-paying job until an actual career comes along, making new friends and has a healthy social life, seems happy.  The illusion is that, although she appears to be functional, her physique shows otherwise.  She has no intention of seeing a therapist and avoids her Dr. at all costs.  Since I am the one she lives with, I know that everyone is waiting to see what my next move is.  Frankly, I feel ""stuck"", burned out from all that we have been through the past two years with this ED.  I honestly feel that unless she wants this for herself, any effort to coerce her to take some kind of action to get healthy is worthless.  On the other hand, I am very anxious about the possibility of something happening to her while I seem to have the caregiving role.  I feel complacent and helpless...",brutus94,"Tue,09/24/2019-5:54pm",Hi Brokenhearted,"Just wanted to say hi, and you aren't alone.  My daughter is 20, we are several years into ED, and my wife and I also fell stuck and burned out.  Everything you said we are either going through currently, or I feel like we are headed in that direction soon.  How do you help someone that doesn't want help?  How do you watch a loved one self-destruct?  What am I going to do to fix this?  This is what keeps me up at night.  I do still believe she can get better and have an incredible life!  But.....here is a cold hard truth we have to accept.......this is not our problem to solve.  We have tried everything we can think of, and we are using all of the leverage we have to force change.  But at the end of the day if she doesn't want to get better, she won't.....at least that is what I have learned so far.

18,dtraynor34,08/19/2019,"""Goal weight"" during AN recovery","My 21 yr old daughter was in residential treatment for 10 weeks for anorexia.  She was moved down to PHP and after 4 weeks moved back up to Residential as they did not see the weight restoration they wanted in PHP.  First, this was a very emotional ""hit"" in the process - she was really progressing in all aspects of PHP except weight.  The therapy team praised her for her participation and dedication to recovering. She is now back to how she was when we first started treatment - depressed, defeated, and miserable with the return to the restrictive/controlled environment in Residential.  And, there is no set plan for moving her back out of Residential - when they think ""it's appropriate"" for her.  The main driver for moving her back to residential is her weight compared to the ""goal weight"" they set for her.  I have asked how they determine goal weight with no good answer (I think it's age, height, gender charts) and how goal weight plays into the recommendations around level of treatment.  We understand that weight restoration is so important.  She has gained X lbs so far in this process.  The goal weight they have given me seems high -- and it would require her to gain another X lbs.Has anyone had to question goal weight? Did your child have to reach full goal weight in order to be moved up in treatment levels?  Do they set goal weights high because they know there will be some weight loss upon returning to PHP, IOP, etc.?We really don't want to discuss weight (the number), it should not be the focus.  But, in our case, this is the only reason they can give us for the return to residential with no real understanding of how/when her weight will be at the right number to move back to PHP and eventually IOP.Any insights are appreciated.  This is so hard -- and I am so extremely proud of my daughter for the progress she has made.  Watching this setback has been hard on all of us.",butterflying,"Tue,09/17/2019-8:03pm",Hi dtraynor34,"That's a shame that her therapist put her back to residential without giving you full answers. Sometimes for eating disorders treatment, certain facilities require a specific criteria to be able for certain programs like residential, PHP or IOP. I would continue to ask the therapist those questions until they give you an answer that you are satisfied with. I hope things start to turn around for your daughter and gets easier on you as well.

19,[email protected],09/13/2019,Daughter 5th admission ,"Hi
I feel I need some more support so I’m here. My 29 year old daughter has been suffering with restrictive anerexia, PTSD, anxiertu and major depressive disorder for 9 years. She lives in Baltimore 90 minutes away. She is being admitted Monday back to a treatment facility for the 5 th time. I’m so depressed and upset. Twice she had to be forced to treatment by her therapist via the ER. This to she has been out of PHP for 4 months. She got a job part time as a contract therapist. She got her masters in social work while this has been going on. It was contractual so she was able to keep her Medicaid and disability. Just to back up she developed the ED sophomore year of college. Spent time inpatient twice but did manage to get her batchlers degree. Came home after graduation and had another stay. She is also suicidal. She went to Baltimore for a job and died pretty well. So well she was goof to study abroad a semester when she enrolled for her masters. Since June of 2016 it’s been awful. She has lost her friends. Her sister has nothing to do with her. Added to that her sister who is 4 years younger is living a charmed life. Bought a house, engaged etc. so we keep the same cycle for almost 3 years. Get sick stay in the treatment facility for months go home and then after a few months back in. This time she is telling me her out patients team knows she is only staying a week and will let her see her clients. I’m calling BS on that one. Probably saying whatever they need to to get her back in treatment. She won’t go anywhere else I’ve tried and she is limited with Medicaid.  She won’t listen to me anyway. I have no control at all. She isolates herself so I won’t know how bad she is. She is very concerned about my anxiety around her hospital stays. When she has been admitted it’s a shit show. She has 12 reptiles and a cat. We have gone in and taken care of everything.  I’ve learned from my support group not to take over and let her call the shots. I’m doing a good job this time but inside I’m falling apart. She is going to lose her job. It took a lot of convincing to get her to find a job because she didn’t want to abandon her clients. I can’t imagine they will keep her if she missed more then a week it two. I know all these details I should not be worrying about but I can’t help it. What’s goof to happen whensje loops her job, who will take cate of these pets etc etc. I know I should be happy sjebis seeking a higher level of treatment but is this ever going to end. I have health problems now. I’m trying to help my other daughter plan a wedding. We have financial issues from helping her.  Our friend and family are not any support anymore. They been there done that. We are alone  my husband tries but .... she won’t move back here and o no options. The ball is in her court and I have no confidence in her treatment. I’m worried she will kill her self over the weekend with the admission coming up Monday and I can’t do a thing. I feel like I’m falling apart. Any support would be appreciated toni",butterflying,"Tue,09/17/2019-7:48pm",Hi joecv5,"I am so so sorry to hear about the struggles you and your husband have gone through with the recovery process for your daughter. When I was going through my ED, my mom was my number one supporter and was there every step of the way, even when I absolutely despised her for trying to get me to start my recovery process. My mom is my number one best friend and she understands that throughout that time when I would be mad at her, if she wasn't there for me, I probably wouldn't be here today. So I do commend you for sticking by her side throughout this roller coaster, it takes a special person to go through that with someone else.
There has been some resources that I found useful from the NEDA website that I'll attach below that might be beneficial to your daughter and yourself. Always remember that we need to keep in check with ourselves and make sure our mental state is capable of continuing to help her, because if you're drained or exhausted, it'll be hard to give all the amount of energy you normally would.
I hope your daughter gets the help she needs and you and your husband continue to look out for yourselves. Keep in touch. <3

20,bennys,08/23/2019,Daughter with depression and now ED,"Reading thru other posts I felt I was looking at a mirror and reciting their words to myself.  We have a 19yr. daughter that we just recently found out has anorexia.  We had to face and battle depression, 2 attempts of suicide and social anxiety and now we get to add to it an eating disorder.  So we have a support system somewhat in place which is helpful, but unfortunately our daughter doesn't take ownership of things enough to keep the support going.  We can keep her in her counseling sessions (which is a positive) but when it comes to staying with the needed meds she won't stay on them regularly and take them unless we push her, and as of recently she has neglected staying active with her Psychiatrist visits and therefore fallen out of ""the system"" and has to be reestablished as a new patient.  So now she is out of meds and we have to wait for an appointment to get into a psychiatrist to get her new prescriptions.  This of course all happens at the same time we've found out about the issues with eating. The first few days of things were scary and positive at the same time.  It was great having her actually come to us with this (which her therapist had convinced her to do).  We felt like she was finally taking ownership of things in her life.  We felt we could help her along the way and monitor here a bit more and get her on track for eating.  Unfortunately what we've found as many of you know, is it just isn't that easy.  Since the initial discovery of it till now, things have gotten no better and we are learning that she has absolutely no interest in changing.  Between the depression and the ED she just doesn't care.  We've talked with her about getting into a nutritionist and been met with the comment of ""whatever, it doesn't matter what they tell me I won't listen and want to keep losing weight"".  We daily force her to eat whatever we can, and get met with resistance every step of the way.  We, as parents, have become just plain tired.  We've battled the depression and suicide (and cutting to make things a bit more complicated) for the last 6 years and felt that up till about 6 months ago we had some success keep her in a good place. Now this creeps up on us.  In the past I've been able to look out and see through it all and know ""we will get through it"".  This is the first time I have to say I can't see the end here.  I've become frustrated!  Between her actions in the past and now this I feel like we have our family life revolves around her.  We have two boys whom we've unfortunately had to push aside at times and ignore.  So I get frustrated, then feel guilty that I'm frustrated with her and the fact our lives can't be ""normal"" (whatever that is anymore) which then leads to me be mad at her and myself.Not even sure what I hope to get with posting this (first time posting on any forum for this).  May be just a great place to vent.  It's hard because there may be support out there but when crap hits the fan, it'sjust you (and your spouse) to wad thru these waters.  It's good to see others get some of the same emotions.  It's just good to know we aren't alone.",Erin_Patricia1,"Fri,08/23/2019-1:53pm",You are not alone,"Hi bennys,First off, I wanted to welcome you to the NEDA online community forums. We are so glad you have found a space where you can share you and your daughter's story. I am so sorry to hear what you and your family have been going through but I also wanted to say that you are NOT alone in this process. I struggled with an eating disorder, depression and anxiety during my late teenage years and into my early twenties and I can tell you, it was very hard on my mother to watch me go through this. At the time, I also did not want to get better and fought recovery the whole way through. I think at one point in my mid twenties, I was just really tired of being sick and tired all the time. You definitely have to want to get better and the pain of change is greater than the pain of staying the same. Does your daughter have a friend or a mentor she can talk to about any of this? When I was in treatment for my eating disorder, depression and anxiety I made a lot of friends and some of which I still talk to today! Or possibly maybe you can suggest her talking on these forums? Please let us know if there is anything more we can do to help! You always have a listening ear here on the NEDA online community forums!Erin_Patricia1 <3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,shanglen,08/07/2019,Daughter home from residential. ,"My 16 year old daughter is home from residential recovery. Step 1. We have a very wonderful therapist, doctor and dietitian in place. Now I am terrified. She's home and that is fabulous. Why am I so freaked? She was in the hospital for refeeding for 3 weeks and finished  residential program. On discharge, they told us that the relapse rate was over 65%.
This was not helpful.
Help! Sigh.",iwanttolive,"Thu,08/08/2019-11:00pm",shanglen,"Hello and welcome to the forum.  I am really sorry for the struggle you are going through.  It is indeed a very difficult and painful journey.  I am sorry for what you were told about the relapse rate.  It is common for someone who has an eating disorder to need more than one inpatient stay, or partial hospitalizations.  The time in a residential or in hospital stay are often too short to learn to develop new and better ways of coping,  One of the goals is to weight stabilize and learn some skills, but then upon release if is true that relapses do occur.  It takes time and practice and therapy to learn the new skills taught and to learn how to accept a different body size.  I had a doctor during a group therapy session give me a zero percent chance of recovery along with another girl.  She did that to me once before with a twenty percent chance.  I proved her wrong and have been in recovery  for fourteen months.  I have recently been dealing with a critically ill sister and I have been eating more than  I would like, but recovery is possible and while your daughter may need more help in the future it doesn't mean she is failing, but growing stronger as she learns how to use her skills, how to learn to live in the real world, how to live without using behaviors.  To learn that in the end they don't really help.  But she needs to learn these thins as she grows and matures.  I am glad you posted and I just want to offer  you a little bit of encouragement.  For now...iwanttolive and I am",PaulShipmanSmith,"Sat,08/24/2019-3:04pm",It must be aworry for you,"It must be a  worry for you because your daughter  has left the security of the treatment provider and is now home, without their constant supervision.  The chances are that you will worry every time you leave her alone.
  The treatment provider telling you about the high relapse rate will certainly have worried you.  However.  As hard as it seemed, they were only being honest and trying to prepare you for the fact that her recovery is going to be a long journey.
  After leaving the treatment provider, your daughter may feel that she is on her own in trying to cope with her situation.  She is young and likely to be feeling nervous about trying to cope without being in the care of the treatment team.
  Even if she didn't like being in care, there is still the likelihood of her experiencing an element of security that has now been removed since leaving.
    You say that she has a wonderful therapist.  This is hopefully a very good start for her journey to recovery as one of the main issues is dealing with all the feelings/emotion that can be involved in her treatment.
  Having a good doctor on board is additional comfort for you in order to deal with the physical aspects of making sure your daughter is as fit and well possible.
  Then there is the dietitian to keep a close eye on what she eats and continue with advising her on her diet as she recovers.
  In all fairness, it appears that you have got everything she needs in place and there is really little more you can do but let the professionals help her.
  Just keep giving her as much encouragement as you can as the emotional support will be one of the most important aspects of her recovery.
  The treatment providers may have left you feeling somewhat disheartened with the '65%' relapse rate but they were just being honest and realistic.  Unfortunately.  There is no easy way to tell you - as a very concerned parent - about the true facts of your daughter's condition and treatment.
  Although - very understandably - you are worried and there are no easy ways to explain things or console you.  However.  With the support your daughter is receiving professionally and especially the support from yourself, your daughter will feel empowered to continue with her recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,brutus94,05/09/2019,Parent struggling to stay positive,"I am the father of a 19 year old with an ED for ~3 years.  We have been through ups and downs, many counselors, treatment options, a 10-day hospital stay, etc.  We have been through all the ""you have to try this"" and ""go to this counselor she is great"" and whatever other advice that friends and family have to offer.  We have been through the barriers where people (friends and family) have overcome their fear of confronting my daughter with their concern for her health and just come right out to tell her ""I know what you are struggling with, and I think you need help"".  We have had talks about short and long term health concerns (bone density, heart health, hair loss, inability to have kids, and death).  There have been so many times where I have thought ""this may finally be the thing that wakes her up and makes a permanent change"", only to have another setback or have her push away and insist on doing things her way.She is an amazingly smart kid.  And she is motivated (and stubborn) like nobody I know.  She has dreams of being a traveling nurse and helping people.  She has excelled academically in her first year of college.  She has knowledge, resources and support.  But in this particular area of her life, it is just not working.  The best way I can describe it is she is 100% committed to a course of action that is resulting in compromised physical health.  Logic and reason do not work.  She is, however, willing to admit there is a problem that requires attention.  But making progress is just so incredibly slow, and sometimes no-existent.  And she is determined to do it her way.  She agrees to go to counseling, but claims it does not help and as a result she fakes her way through it so at least she can say ""I'm trying"".  The phrase ""I'm trying"" is very frustrating for me to hear, because I can instantly think of 5-10 things that she will refuse to try.I cycle through emotional stages of hope, acceptance, frustration, sadness, depression, and anger.  My wife and I are tired.  I often feel like the best thing I can do is to keep my mouth shut and avoid lashing out in anger and frustration (I have learned my lesson that this does not help, and any temporary feeling of relief in blowing off steam is soon overshadowed by feelings of guilt and shame).  Most recently, we have told her that our financial assistance for college will end if her health does not improve.  It makes me sad to think she may miss out on an amazing, successful, and happy life.  She hates the idea of spending all her money on college, and she absolutely won't quit, so I am HOPEFUL once again that we have created a situation where she has to decide what option she wants to choose.  I have come to realize that nobody can help her unless she decides she wants the help.  I wish this was wrong, and correct me if I am.  Thanks for reading.",iwanttolive,"Thu,05/09/2019-10:05pm",brutus94,"Hello.  I am so sorry you are going through this.  I am a daughter of two parents who both happen to be nurses.  I had a severe eating disorder and believe me, I understand what you are saying.  I ""knew"" everything.  I knew I wouldn't die from the eating disorder, that I wasn't ""that bad"", I knew that my self harm was not that bad, that I would possibly be able to die from that.  I was so smart.  I was x amount of pounds but I was fine.  No one could convince me otherwise.  The one thing I did do was go into hospitals to make my parents happy and because they were safer than living out in the real world.  The fear my parent's lived with.  I was always and honest ""Abe"".  That is until it came to how much I ate, or exercised, etc.  I never thought I would lie to my parents.  One thing is that I was usually open and honest with my therapists, but I was not ready to get better for many years and nothing anyone said made any difference. I was afraid to get better.  I am now fully in recovery for one year from all forms of the eating disorder and three years from anorexia.  I had bulimia for a number of years off and on but it was mostly the anorexia and binging.  So when you say all the yelling, convincing and wishing won't change her, that she has to be ready to want to change, unfortunately that is true.  One has to want to change.  One good thing is that she has acknowledged that something is wrong and she needs help.  That is huge.  Hold onto that Hope.  For me, my faith in Jesus was instrumental in my healing, as well as my parent's love and never giving up on me.  It makes sense to me to hold off on paying for more college if she is not well.  She may be very angry with you for this, but she needs to know how serious her condition is and you support her and love her enough to not allow her to continue to self destruct.  I am so sorry for your frustration and pain.  I am glad you posted and are looking for support.  You are not alone. I am going to find an old post of mine and bring it to the top for you to read.  It is a letter to parents based on my story.  I hope it gives you hope.  Keep Hoping.  There is Hope and help.  I hear your pain and frustration.  I understand it.

There are very few people in our lives that can truly understand what this is like, so to be able to hear from others with real experience is a helpful.  We really hope the tuition holdout is a motivator.  Since she is 19 now we are limited in what we can ""force"" her to do (ie, treatment, hospital etc), but we have also considered the idea of trying to get her to sign a medical power of attorney.  This may not be an area you feel comfortable commenting on, but if you are I would be interested in hearing pros and cons from those with more experience.  The tradeoff is us being able to force her into treatment that she doesn't want......it may be good for the short term, but in the long term that is really just us forcibly taking control and may result in her digging in further.  I'm not sure how far to let her fall on her own, and it is terrifying to think of some of the possible outcomes.",iwanttolive,"Mon,05/13/2019-2:55pm",brutus94,"Hi.  I allowed my parents to have medical power of attorney over me for a while.  It can be a bit scary to do this, but I knew I needed help and they are both nurses and I knew they would not abuse the power....So, it your daughter is willing, or if her doctor deems her in need of someone taking over her medical decisions it may need to go through a proceeding of some sort for you to get the power of attorney if she doesn't willingly let you have it.  I don't know if it will help or not, because if your daughter is not ready to get well, forcing it may hurt your relationship. But at the same time, if she is unable to make clear decisions and is a harm to herself it may be needed.  I would see if you can talk with a counselor about this as well as checking with NEDA and get their opinion.  I am sorry I can not give you more of an opinion.  This is something you really need to talk to a professional about and as I said, NEDA may be able to give you their input.

I am just checking in to see how you and your family and daughter are doing?iwanttolive and I  am,brutus94,"Mon,05/27/2019-8:27am",Still struggling to stay positive......,"Thanks for checking in! My daughter hit rock bottom last year at this time, but made significant improvements over the summer and was able to go to college (the one of her choice).  She was so excited to be able to go to the school she really wanted to go to, and I thought that coupled with the experience of being hospitalized would mean she would never go backward.  So to be near that low point again this year is pretty depressing for her and for us.  The road seems so long, and I think some days she really does want to get better but it just seems so overwhelming.  I get how that would be difficult for her to face.  But at the same time, I can't overlook the fact that this is the result of months of poor decision-making.  But that is the past, and dwelling on the past has never been helpful.So, trying to look forward........she is at a point where she really needs to gain just to get out of a danger-zone area.  We don't include her in walks or trips to the gym because that is all out of the question right now.  She blames us for not letting her do these things, like a whinny child trying to get their way.  The realization that she isn't getting a car or help with tuition this fall is still months away, so it has not really become a motivator for her yet........so we are trying to find some shorter-term motivators.  No walks is one, and no family trips is another.  We usually take a family trip to an amusement park, and we told her we will go as a family once she is in better health.  I know it is hard on her younger siblings, but they don't say it, and honestly they are not the parents and don't feel the burden to fix it.So we wait patiently, and I try to do my venting while alone in the car or while out walking the dog with my wife.  I miss my old kid and I want her back.  At times I resign myself to the possibility that it may never happen.  She has missed out on a lot, and with each day and month she misses out on more.  Her friends from high school have all come home, and I suspect they are very concerned for her again (and perhaps disappointed, maybe even angry).  I avoid talking about it to friends and relatives because it doesn't really help and often makes me angry, like ""great idea gee, I never thought of that!"".  I understand what they are thinking..........she is such a great kid, and we are not bad/stupid parents.  So why is it so hard to fix?  That is a great question.....",iwanttolive,"Mon,05/27/2019-10:28am",brutus94,"Hi.  I am so sorry about your daughter not doing well in college. I know it is painful but college is so very stressful for a healthy person.  Throw in someone who is dealing with an eating disorder plus the issues one has to deal with that caused them to turn to needing the eating disorder.   For me, once I was able to trust Jesus with the fears that I had and allow Him to help me deal with the fears ( it took a very long time for me to be able to do this), but once I did I was able to recover.  I want you to know that she has to be ready to confront her fears and pain and then she will not ""need"" to use the eating disorder as a way to cope.  It will  still take work to relearn how to live without the behaviors but it IS possible.  For  me it was very quick once I handed my trust over to Jesus.  Even though I  have been a Christian for a long time, it took me actually  transferring over the baton to Him.  I have been free from all behaviors for a year in June.I hear the frustration in you.  This isn't something YOU can fix, really.  Yes, set up boundaries and parameters.  No. She isn't going to like them or you probably.  It is more likely the fact that she is afraid that you are trying to ""take away"" the eating disorder from her and right now she needs it.  I know that sounds strange, how can someone ""need"" something that is so horrible and difficult to live with, yet there are always reasons.  Are you getting help for yourself?  Any parent going through this can benefit from getting professional help for themselves.  You seem to be doing a good job at doing everything you know to do to  help your daughter.  A lot of parent's wouldn't do what you are doing and this tells me you love her and want what is best for her and I admire that.  I know it is painful and you feel helpless.   Tell her you love her with words.  Daughters need to here that from their dads.  I know you love her and want  so badly for her to get well.  She needs to want if for herself.  Don't give up.

I am a daughter of two loving parents who did everything they knew to do to help me, but as so many say, it needs to come from the person with the disorder.

I am going over the journals in hopes of writing a memoir or short story.  I am amazed by some of the things I wrote.  I am so afraid of giving up this disorder, sin, to You Lord, I know I am  hurting You by hurting myself and not trusting You but I am terrified of living, of the pain of letting go.  I feel as though my fist is crazy glued shut but I want so badly to open up my hands and surrender this to You.  This goes on for months of this type of writing.  Pleading prayers to God of repentance, of knowing His way was so much better than mine, reading His Word and finding Hope in it; I will not die but live and declare the works of The Lord.  Psalm 118:17.  I had no idea God gave me this verse so many decades ago.  The fear of letting go of something so harmful because I was so afraid of what laid beyond it.  What if I wasn't happy after I let go of the eating disorder.  What if all the bad things happen to me that happened to my family members?  What if....I was so afraid of living.  And of dying.  But that is what I was doing.  It wasn't until a women's retreat last June, one year, that God freed me from all forms of the eating disorder and self harm.  It will be about three years from the anorexia and about ten or less from the bulimia.  One full year from all self harm which had gotten severe, and binging and overeating.  And intense fear of being a normal weight even though I had been weight restored.  At the retreat, I was able to finally surrender my fear to God.  To trust Him with the things that had me so afraid.  Of people.  Of growing up. Of being independent.  Of dating and getting married.  I have chosen to remain single at this time, I am 51.  I have single friends and am happy.  For the first time in my life I am happy and want to live.  I never thought I could say that as I was so depressed.  I told my forth grade teacher that I wanted to end my life.  This teacher did nothing and I got no help until the anorexia developed many years later.I say all of this to give you Hope.  That you need to hand your daughter over into the capable hands of Our Savior.  To know that He loves her even more than you do.  That He has to work on her heart, for her to trust Him and transfer her fears onto Him.  Pray for this to happen.  I was in so many hospitals because I felt safer there than out in the real world even though I hated being in the hospital and day programs.  But I was sheltered.   This was in the days when I was in a hospital for a year, or six months at a time.   Now the stays are much shorter and I think too short to really address the problem effectively.I share my story because that is what I feel I am called to do.   To offer Hope, Jesus to some and for you.  If it were not for Jesus, I would not have lived.  My Mom may not be who she is today.  It was scary for them, both my parents nurses, my dad on lay offs from being a pilot would do nursing when he wasn't flying.  I want to offer you Hope.  Jesus.  Lay your fears at His feet as your daughter needs to do the same.  When I did, Jesus took away even the desire to use behaviors and I have been behavior free from last June 6th or so until this day.  I still have pain, hurt, anger, physical pain, emotional pain, fear.  But I know that using behaviors will never make them go away and dealing with them with Christian friends and my parent's and my pastor and of course Jesus IS the answer.  Next Saturday I go back to the retreat.  I was actually in a hospital that Friday and I told the doctor I didn't need to be there, he agreed and I went to the retreat that afternoon and the rest is History.  I have come to say it is our story because without Jesus it wouldn't be a story.
I hope our story offers you some hope and eases some of the pain you are feeling.  Jesus holds all of your tears in a bottle.  It says that somewhere in the Bible.  He knows what is going on with your daughter, her fears, the reasons she is afraid to let go of what is hurting her.  Cry out to Jesus that she will learn to trust Him with these fears as I did.  I am no one special.  My journey was a very long and painful one.  But once I surrendered, He stepped in.  You need to surrender your daughter into Jesus hands tonight.  He knows your tomorrows.  He has her in His very capable hands.  I do not know what her future holds.  Only Jesus does.   Make sure you are getting support for yourselves and just let your daughter that you love her and if she wants to talk you will be there for her.  You are doing a good job.  You are loving her well.iwanttolive and I am",mgord,"Thu,06/20/2019-4:55pm",I could have written that post as well,"I'm a father of the most sweetest girl.  She is 18 and going to college next year.  3 times around with all kinds of treatment.  Time and money mean nothing to me as long as we kick this disease.  We are in the tail end of a 6 month stint at a hospital, in-patient, PHP and IOP.  I call this the honey moon period.  She is doing well and looking forward to college.  I am under no misconception that we will be dealing with this again.  I have a sliver of hope that this time will work which is worse than having no hope.  At least I know what to expect...  I guess what I've learned so far is this is a mental illness and she will be fighting this for the rest of her life.  Don't get frustrated with her (very hard to do).  I think of this like bi polar or any other mental illness where she is very focused on herself and we are there to rescue when things get bad.  And they do...  Have your own hobbies and think long term.  Make sure to take breaks and spell your spouse as well so she can take breaks.  I'm not very religious and don't know what works but if that does then I'm all for it.  I like reading the comments from ""iwanttolive"" and am glad she has found her center.  I guess there has to be something more important in their lives instead of ED.Hope this helps....",brutus94,"Fri,06/28/2019-10:11pm",Guilt and self-doubt.....,"Alot of what you are saying resonants with me.  Somedays i have hope and optimism, some days none.  I totally agree that spouses need to balance each other, my wife is amazing but everyone has their limit of frustration. Occasionally we second guess everything because family or friends feel we are not doing enough.  There are times of fatigue and hopelessness, but those are usually on the heels of pushing to the point where you feel you might just snap.  That where i agree you need your own life and hobbies.Wondering if anyone else struggles with self-doubt, especially when talking with extended family or friends that are concerned.",BlueMoon,"Wed,07/03/2019-3:24pm",I can empathize! We're there now.,"brutus94 - we are walking similar journeys. Yes, we struggle with self doubt. All the time. My precious husband and I go from wanting to rescue her to digging our heels in and saying she will have to reach out for help if she wants it. We don't know what is the right thing to do. You're damned if you and damned if you don't do. Meanwhile, we have family that understand and are so compassionate and caring. While others look at us and say we are over-reacting. ""She's just little skinny. A lot girls her age are skinny."" <deep sigh> There is so much misinformation and misunderstanding about ED....and that just puts more pressure on the ED sufferer and their family.Our daughter’s current state, she will die if she doesn't get help. So her therapist is trying to stage an intervention where we can whisk her away to a ED residential facility. We have traveled this journey for 6 years. Two facilities and countless hours of family-based therapy….we are now back to ground zero. She was thriving when she entered first year of college and then couldn't handle the stress and peer pressure. She skipped classes the first semester and stopped going all together the second semester…. but didn't tell anyone. She then retreated to someone's apartment and lived there....no one knowing where she was. She stopped talking to us. We had to get the sheriff involved to find her. We advised her to attend a smaller college, but she wouldn't listen. The university was too big...not that it would have made any different, we think now. We can't reconcile the person she is now with the person she once was. No comparison. It's heartbreaking. So I totally hear and feel your angst and pain in this battle against ED.Balance, yes, we are trying to do that. But it’s tough. You love your child. You never stop being a parent. Our biggest self-doubting comes with family and friends that tell us to just let her be. Let her hit rock bottom and then she will be forced to get help. Hospitalization, etc. Really? Is that what they would do for their own children? I doubt it.We try to educate others, but it’s tough. Some people just don’t care to know, while others think they know it all. There is a part of me that wishes they had to experience ED for themselves and then they can give me advice.It’s also hard to follow social media, watching all these same negative nellies posting photos of their children, while our only child is struggle to live. <deep sigh>So you aren’t alone. Hang in there. Have you ever read the book “Brave Girl Eating” by Harriet Brown. Excellent. I have had the pleased to speak with Harriet on two occasions. She is the real deal. Loves her daughter and has been a Mama Bear in getting he the best help. Amazing story.God bless you. Stay in touch. Prayers for your daughter and family.

At the same time, i am sorry you are going through this also. We are at a low, just waiting until the crisis unfolds.  My daughter is firmly committed to returning to college this fall, but i just dont see how.  So that is our next crisis point.  She refuses to consider alternatives, and refuses to do what we think is necessary to get better.  She is irritated because we go on walks and to the gym without her.  Umm, reallt?  Blue Moon, i get your deep sigh my friend.It is sad because many of her friendships are gone, but not all.  Many family have stopped asking how she is doing because they know, and because she avoids them.  It is really hard to watch.  People can sympathize and understand cancer.  My wife battled it for 2 years, chemo and the whole bit.  Friends brought meals, cards, prayers.  But how do you explain that your kid is sick and refuses treatment?  How do you help someone that doesn’t want your help?  Uggh.  Deep sigh.  And on it goes.  I just got the book Brave Girl Eating.  I will post again when im finished.  Until then, i will keep trying to live my life, and keep trying to do my best for my daughter.",BlueMoon,"Tue,07/16/2019-7:19pm",Hang in There,"brutus94....hang in there. My husband and I have lost friends too. So much misinformation about ED. Makes me crazy. And yes, if it were cancer, people would be falling over themselves to help you and your daughter. Meanwhile, don't neglect your wife and other children. It's hard to do. You want so badly to save the one that doesn't want saving, but that can hurt the others. Balance is important in these situations. I hope you enjoy Harriet Brown's journey with her daughter. She doesn't sugar-coat it. She has a blog that has since been retired where she addresses some of the hard issues on hospitalization. She advocates FBT (Family Based Therapy) which is what we have utilized. It has helped greatly. God bless you and your family in this journey. Reach out again if you need some moral support.Also, Jenni Schaeffer's books are excellent. ""Life Without Ed""BlueMoon",brutus94,"Thu,08/01/2019-10:29pm",Need another shot of hope!,"So my daughter has been home from college for 3 months now, and has pretty much remained at a what I consider to be a critical point.  We knew her first year away at school was hard, but I really thought she would ""bounce back"" this summer and be ready to go back to school this fall.  Now, that just doesn't appear to be possible.  Rather than forbid her to go back, we setup milestones for her and tied those to the $$ we were providing to help with school and car.  So we are a month away from the start of school and it just doesn't seem to be coming together.She has really tried, and she does eat, but it apparently is not enough and she just can't seem to gain any weight.  It's all the same things...…""it's too much"", or ""I don't like it"", or ""I feel bloated"".  I think she is sneaking in walks or sneaking out of eating some food, I don't know it's hard to tell without being a full time policeman.  She goes to counseling, but who knows if it actually does any good.  I looked into what happens to her scholarships if she takes a semester off, and it doesn't sounds like it would be a problem (I know, helicopter parent) but she absolutely doesn't want to discuss that option.  Wow.  So basically her plan is to ""keep trying"" and have everything magically work out?  Not really a high likelihood plan...….so I guess we are left with waiting out the next 4 weeks until the inevitable hits and she has to pay for all her own tuition.  Without any other viable option being pursued.  Or considered.  Or discussed.I don't deal well in situations like this!  You can't start looking for off campus apartments 30 days before class starts!  You can't undo 8 months of terrible planning in 4 weeks!  But.....it's not my problem to solve.  I know.  I'm going to have to let her fail on her own.  But I also have to live in the same house and that is extremely stressful.  I have to live with guilt trips because ""I can go walk the dog but she can't"".  And ""everybody gets to do fun stuff but me"".  Uggh.  Enough already.  So......I vent here so I don't vent to her.  Because saying ""either do something about it or shut up!"" would be mean and hurtful.  And I vent here because you all understand my frustration and most of my friends, co-workers, and family really just don't.  So thanks for reading my rant.On a sort of positive note, we have identified some good support options for her should she choose to try them out.  I had a good conversation with a nurse at an ED clinic that explained the transition from the ""child"" model of treatment to the ""adult"" model.  The conversation made me feel like it wasn't all my fault, which I know, but sometimes it is good to hear it again.  Bless her heart she was so encouraging and uplifting...….it was a nice boost for me.  I just wish she would be more open minded.  I wish she could see how great her life could be if only she could beat this thing.",iwanttolive,"Fri,08/02/2019-10:12pm",brutus94,"Hi.  I am glad that you are able to come here and vent and to get support.  What I can say as a recovered daughter  of parent's who went through  this horrible illness for thirty years before I started strong recovery, is that it is as you said, terrible.  Most people, even professional's don't all agree on the best method or approach on treating people with eating disorders.  I am sorry friends have left you over this.  That is not fair, nor is it right.  I lost some friends but more didn't have friends because of how shy I was.  Not anymore!!!!I think it is a shame that there is so little out there to help those suffering with eating disorders.  The stats are that one person every hour dies from an eating disorder and that doesn't even talk of the horror of living day after day suffering, many alone because there is so little out there to help those suffering.I am proud or you and for all the love and help you are offering your daughter.  Right now she may be very angry with you, but deep down inside, I believes what your are saying is true.  It's just that it is SO scary to let of the need to be thin.  Some are the opposite and need to hide behind their weight. I think what you are doing sounds good but  also hear weariness and maybe feeling a bit burnt out but all of this.  Do you ever have you time, or a date night?  To do something fun, to put the pain aside for a while and just do what makes you happy.  Good medicine for the soul.  For now...iwanttolive",Charlet,"Tue,08/06/2019-4:58am",Hi! Its heartbraking to read,Hi! Its heartbraking to read your stories. In my experience one can not wait around until the adolescence decides to get well. Parents are the biggest resource for recovery from ED.,brutus94,"Tue,08/06/2019-2:24pm",Heart breaking indeed.I can,"Heart breaking indeed.  I can't force my daughter to get better (we have tried), but we can encourage and motivate (no tuition assistance until you get the help you need).  She goes to counseling, she goes to the doctor, and she eats.  But there are limits to everything she is willing to do and as a result, she struggles.  So what is a parent left to do?  Obtain medical power of attorney (either by their choice, or by a judges order over their choice) and force her into a treatment facility.  Is that what you are suggesting?  Is your experience as a professional (dr, counselor, etc), as a parent/caregiver, or as an ED sufferer?  Her current counselor, who struggled with ED and self harm in the past, has told us and our daughter that she has to want to get better......us ""wanting"" it for her just won't work.In response to Iwanttolive.......yes, my wife and I do try to take care of ourselves to the extend possible.  We exercise and walk the dog (2 of our favorite stress relievers).  Unfortunately every time we do one of those things, it is a trigger for my daughter.  She wants to do those things also, but we have told her she can't until she gains enough to be out of the critical zone.  So doing what we enjoy can sometimes come with stress and guilt."
23,iwanttolive,07/14/2019,brutus94,"Hi.  As you know I am not a parent, but am in strong recovery from a long struggle with eating disorders.  I am really sorry you are struggling and are in so much pain.  I  just wanted to say that I am in a different but sorta similar situation with my sister.  She has been in the hospital for a month, and is critically ill.  She had to have a j tube surgically implanted because she is unable to swallow.  There is a long history behind this and her refusal to get herself to a doctor two years ago may have prevented this horrible situation.  Her intestines shut down as well as her esophagus.  She is only able to get nutrition through this formula.  But for weeks she had no nutrition.  Her body is not tolerating the feeding and she is in severe pain.  Her intestines are working again but not well.  She can not tolerate the feedings.  We are all very concerned and wish so badly that she had gotten help before it got to this crisis.  We pray, we do our best to support her, and we pray.So I understand the frustration of having your hands tied, and watching your daughter self destruct.  My parent's did that with me.  Self destruct for thirty years until I finally was able to choose recovery and accept God's way over my own.  And I am forever grateful.  It hasn't been easy.  Knowing that there is nothing you can do to ""make"" someone want to get well, to make them go to a doctor, or do anything really.  I pray for you and hope that your daughter sees your love for her and that she will want to live and see what she is doing.  We need to entrust our loved ones to God and do what we need to do for ourselves along the way.  You sound like a very caring father.  It tore my parent's up to watch me suffer.  Now we are watching my sister suffer, although she doesn't have an eating disorder she didn't take care of herself and things may not be as serious as they are now if she did.  That being said, we need to look at today and take it one day at a time.  Don't give up.  Trust God. Get yourself some support and keep posting for support here.

I do realize we can still battle and win, and i am gearing up now for another strong push to improve before we have to resort to hospitalization.

The plans and obstacles that block acceptance of treatment can be torn down so fast (job, school, etc mean nothing if you are dead).  But in her mind it is the whole world crashing down.  Being vegan is another battle we cant seem to win, but that seems secondary now.  Thanks again for your support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,BlueMoon,07/03/2019,ED Intervention:Anyone Here Have Experience?,"In short, our daughter's therapist wants to conduct and intervention to get our daughter into residential care. As I write this message, our daughter has cut off all communication with therapist, doc and us, her parents. (For the past four months) She does not respond to any texts or phone calls from anyone, even extended family. It is believed, based upon social media posts that she is engaging actively in alcohol and drugs. She doesn't even look like our daughter.Does any parent here, or ED survivor, have experience with doing an intervention for their child, or as an ED patient? At this point, it we wish to intervene and save her life, it's going to involve the police. We have been told that we should seek a court ordered guardianship as an option, but how effective is that?If you did an intervention for your child, did it help or make matters worse? She is restore and thrive, or just went through the motions and went right back to her lifestyle?Anything you can offer us is greatly appreciated. This is uncharted water for us. Need some comfort from experienced families.Thank you,
BlueMoon",iwanttolive,"Wed,07/03/2019-5:29pm",Blue Moon,Hello. I am the mom of iwantolive.  I can only imagine your pain.  It sounds like this is a situation of saving a life or not.  I only know that at this point your daughter is not in her right mind.  If you choose to do an intervention it will give her a chance of being able to think clearly and hopefully making wise mind choices.  Despair is ugly and paints a picture that is not reality.  There is no hope in the dark place of despair.  What are you willing to risk?  Have you thought about how you would feel if you did nothing?  It sounds like you have support of therapists who are encouraging an intervention.  I hear you asking if it will work....God has given each of us a free will which is a gift.  It is hard to see our loved ones use this gift to destroy themselves.  With God there is always hope.  I have had to surrender our daughters in various circumstances to our Lord and  trust Him in the process.  It has only been crying out to Him for direction that I have found peace in doing what I believed He showed me to do.  It is faith that brings us peace as we seek His direction.  I will pray for you to find the place of peace in your decision that only He can give you.  The complexity of life is what throws us into His arms.  I found my only Hope was in knowing that He is in the fire with me and to keep my eyes on Him and not the fire (problems) saved my soul.  Blessings and love from my heart to yours.,iwanttolive,"Wed,07/03/2019-7:41pm",BlueMoon,"Hi.   Before I start, I just want to let you know that we are not allowed to post weights or numbers.  You didn't know but the moderators will edit it out and let you know, so just a heads up unless you can go back and edit your own post.  No worries.  They will just tell you it isn't allowed and ask you to review the policy.As far as your daughter is concerned, I am concerned for you too.  It is so very difficult to watch a child suffer.  It is difficult to watch a sister suffer and I have been doing that for many years.  She recently had severe medical issues and has been in the hospital and will hopefully be coming home to a rehab at the local hospital for about ten days.  It is difficult to know what to do, what is enabling and what is helping.  My mother, the above post, has questioned herself on how she dealt with me and the severity of my problems.  She wonders if she were more strict, if she laid out more restrictions, such as if you continue to do this you will no longer be able to live with us, or at the house I now live at with my sister and a roommate.  My folks live three houses down.  She questions herself but she needs to let that go as I am in recovery now.  I think having an intervention is a good idea because as you said, it is a matter of life and death.  Once she gets nourished and she begins to think more clearly, because in a state of starvation, the brain is not capable of making any kind of decision at all, she will then be responsible for making her decisions. I went to a support group last night for people with addictions and asked the question about enabling verses helping.  Some said if one does something for another that they are able to do themselves, that is enabling. If a person doesn't take care of themselves, getting to doctors appointments, doing what the doctor says, and then asks for help and support, that is enabling.  For you, your daughter is not able to make any clear headed decisions.  Until she is able to, it is wise for you to intervene.  It may be that she will not want to talk with you again.  She may hate you.  But I believe that would be the eating disorder talking.  A lot of people with anorexia don't want it ""taken"" away from them.  It becomes an identity, a way to cope with pain, as with drug abuse and alcohol abuse.  It is a way of avoiding life, pain, fear, you name it.  As for you and your husband and if you have other children, it may be good to get some support for yourselves as you are dealing with all of this.  It is incredibly difficult.  My Mom never knew if she would get a call or a knock on the door from the police saying they found me unresponsive in my car.  She lived with the fear of me not waking up in the morning.  I hate that I did that to my parents.  I am glad for their support over the years and don't think I could have made it without them, but maybe my Mom is right.  If she laid the rules down and stuck to them, would I have been sick for as long as I was?  That is something we can not focus on anymore.  What they did was their best, and that is what you  are doing.  I will also pray for you and please stay in touch and let us know how things are going.  Take care..  You are in His hands.iwanttolive and I am",BlueMoon,"Wed,07/03/2019-8:16pm",WOW! Powerful support iwanttolive,"First, thank you for the reminder. I removed the numbers. ;)Thank you both mother and daughter for the words of encouragement and support. Yes, intervention is what we all think is best. Her therapist is a Christian, former ED patient, went on to get her PhD in Psychology. She is amazing. Love that women. I suppose in our moments of delusion, her dad and I want to believe that she will just snap out of it...but we know that won't happen. She needs serious help. And to compound the problem, she is hanging with a bunch of young people who are not helping. They are telling her that her parents are too controlling, you don't need a therapist....you don't need medication....""here take a drink of this...it will make you feel better."" <scream> Her therapist has told us that she believes that our daughter's roommate is part of the problem. I totally agree. The girl is a moocher and manipulator. That's a whole other story. ED patients don't have good judgement anyway.I agree. Without God I am nothing. We have gotten this far with his guidance and intercession. I know that he is at work here. Since she is avoiding everyone and this intervention effort has just escalated. We might have to force her into a facility. The only hesitation my husband and I have is reading so much material telling parents if their children do not want the help, they will just go through the motions and return home to the same issues. She has already been through two nationally recognized facilities. The first want she attended against her will. The second one she asked to help and took the initiative to go and participate. She restored to a healthy state....and her sweet little personality returned and couldn't thank us enough.Now she's back to ground zero again...no, even lower than when she entered the last facility.I pray for strength and courage to do what is necessary. Her dad (my husband) and I know that this intervention effort may make her so angry she will never speak to us again. But I'd rather her live a healthy successful life and her not speak to me, than watch her laying on a hospital gurney dying and apologizing for not listening to us.Please keep us in prayer.

Hope deferred makes the heart sick.  Somewhere in Proverbs.  I am glad you trust her therapist.  That is really good.  Please let me know how you are doing and if you do do an intervention.  Do you know where she will go and are they ready to accept her?   We can't think as those without Hope.  God is able to work the impossible and breath His breathe into anyone's life.

But for the last several months, her eating has changed and she engages in behaviors, such as really only buying a few foods, which are not nutritious. Like she eats only three things, and one she eats with the freezer door open, standing there, etc. So I have suggested she challenge herself, but we are trying to just do meal support by eating with her, and that is the only support we are allowed to offer. Question: should I push her a but by saying we won't pay for groceries if she is not challenging these behaviors? Or should we do nothing? Thanks!",BlueMoon,"Mon,07/15/2019-7:54pm",Setting Boundaries,"Hi, Doodlemom,I'm a mother of a now 21 year old...and we have been traveling this journey for 6 years. So I can empathize with your situation. I have read and studied everything I can get my hands on. We have been in FBT (family-based therapy) for four years with an ED nutrition specialist to help our daughter restore. It is important that the entire family understand the nature of this beast and not allow it to control you. We are still traveling this journey, since our daughter had a setback last year.It is so easy for the parent to be held hostage by their child's eating disorder. ED wants to be in control of everything. Thus, you lose control.Regarding your question...""Should I push her a bit by saying we won't pay for groceries if she is not challenging these behaviors? Or should we do nothing?""Questions before I respond:*   Does we work?
*   Is she expected to contribute to the house hold budget?
*   If she doesn't eat meals with you, then how is she learning to enjoy engaging with food?
*   Do you prep food for her? I have so much to say...but don't want to over inform you. ;)BlueMoon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I just posted something about it. ""Letting Go and Trusting God"".....Without her cooperation, it won't work. And no facility will take her if she is combative and a flight-risk.

27,BlueMoon,06/22/2019,Daughter Now Disconnecting with Parents/Family,"I'm the mother of a precious 21 yr old daughter who has battled anorexia for the past 7 years after suffering a trauma. During that time, she has been in two PHP programs, ongoing FBT (Family-based Therapy) with a nutritionist, psychiatrist, physician and therapist. The rollercoaster ride between successes and setbacks has been exhausting. Eight months ago, some of her friends convinced her that she didn’t need to be on depression medication and that she didn’t have an eating disorder, “she’s just small boned and skinny.” Due to peer pressure, she moved out of the house and that’s when she dropped to a dangerous level. Her therapy team says she needs to be in a residential facility. We are working on that. Meanwhile, her personality has changed so dramatically is frightening. She has disordered thinking due to malnutrition. She has now disconnected with us (her father and I) and the rest of the family. She no longer responds to text messages or phone calls. Because of her age, we can’t forcibly remove her from her apartment and place her in a facility, as many have acknowledged here. If she doesn’t want the treatment, it’s a waste of money and effort. Therefore, all we can do is pray and hope that someone somewhere will convince her to seek the help she deserves. We will be waiting here for the Prodigal Daughter to return.So my question here is this…..anyone here who had a daughter stop talking with them, disconnect with them, and ultimately sought the treatment they needed. My fear is that due to her weight, BMI, depression and last lab tests that clearly showed dangerously low Vit D and iron…she is going to drop dead from a heart attack.Like many mother and fathers here, we have had to accept that we raised her up “in the way that she should go so that when she is old she will not depart from it” - but she is possessed by a hideous demon that will not let her go until she rebukes him. I hate ED. Any thoughts?Thank you,
BlueMoon",iwanttolive,"Sun,06/23/2019-10:20pm",BlueMoon,"Hello.  It saddens me to read your post.  I am a Christian and suffered with various eating disorders and self harm for thirty years.  My parent's never stopped praying.  I can somewhat understand how you feel as my Mom has shared with me what it was like for them to go through all those years with me and not being able to do much but have me go into hospital programs.  The difference with your daughter and me is that I number one-needed to go in as it was too scary for me to live in the real world and two, I allowed my parents to make me go even if I didn't want to, even as an adult.  I am sorry your daughter's ""friends"" have convinced her that she doesn't need help.  And you are correct that someone can not force another to want to get well, but being nourished and given the chance to be able to think more clearly can definitely help.  My parent's chose to keep me under their care, supporting me throughout the time I was ill. My mother sometimes questions whether that was the best choice and others told her to cut me loose and let me fend for myself. But she knew that I would not have been able to survive without their help.  Every parent has to come to that decision for themselves as they know their child the best.  I wound up after thirty years recovering.  Long dark scary days and nights did my parent's spend as did I.  Our faith sustained all of us.  Without Jesus in our lives we don't know what would have happened.  I know you are scared and even though you have done all you can do in the natural, you can continue to do in the spiritual.  For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds-demolishing strongholds against Truth...2 Cor. 10:4I hear your fear, pain and sorrow.  After you have done all, stand...We don't know what the choices our loved ones will make and the outcomes, but we pray and seek God's face.  I lost my nephew to suicide after an addiction to drugs.  My sister is critically ill in the hospital at the moment, some due to her own negligence and some because of the illness she has.  She possibly made things worse by not getting help sooner but there was nothing we could do as she refused for a long time.  Then it became critical.  I am fortunate that I survived and live to help others with eating disorders and support parents even though I am not one.  I lost out on all of that due to the eating disorder and fear.  One of the reasons for me needing the disorders.  But never give up on Hope, our Savior.  You are doing all you know how to do.  The demon the illness, once she starts saying no to it then her recovery can begin.  For you, I encourage you to get help for yourself.  You need help and support while going through this.  I hope you are connected with a good church and have a church family that you can lean on, but also to consider therapy.  Maybe talk with a NEDA support person.  I am glad you posted and asked for help and support.  I am again sorry for the fear but try to keep handing her over into God's capable hands.  I wish there was a magic answer to take away the pain and for your daughter to just be OK.  Pray.  Stand your ground.  Stay close to God.  iwanttolive and I am",BlueMoon,"Mon,06/24/2019-2:34pm",IWantToLive,"OMG! What a powerful testimony of faith, courage and perseverance. Thank you for taking the time to respond and offer your wisdom and experience. I am blessed by your willingness to share. We continue to lean on God. You are correct about ED and malnutrition. Our daughter is making unhealthy choices and can’t hold down a job. Disordered thinking it out of control. So out of character for her. I agree it’s her journey, but like your mom, I’m not willing to just sit back and watch her die before my eyes. We have lined up residential programs. Trying to stage an intervention, if she can get to her therapist (who an amazing woman) at her own free will. She is so tired and depressed. It’s heartbreaking.God bless you abundantly for your willingness to respond and offer me moral support. I feel so helpless at times. Like I’ve said before, when she was little it was so much easier. I could pick up and hold her, kiss the boo-boo, tell her that we’d put a Dora the Explorer band-aid on it and it would be much better. <smile> I guess I would look pretty silly doing that now to a 21 year old woman. <laughing> But if it worked a miracle, I would do it in a heartbeat.Enjoy the rest of your day.
BlueMoon",iwanttolive,"Mon,06/24/2019-6:16pm",BlueMoon,"Hello again.  I am  glad that you found my post helpful.  One thing to consider is that if your daughter is declared incompetent and unable to make decisions due to the illness you can look into becoming her medical power of attorney and then you can make medical decisions for her and have her placed in a program against her will.  My parent's had that for a while with me.  It also allowed them to speak with the doctors when otherwise they would not be allowed because of HIPPA.  This is a good law but also harmful as it blocks parents from being able to help their adult children from getting necessary help.  Yes, being able to apply a band-aid would be nice.  But when malnutrition sets in the brain is unable to make clear decisions.  So much of her behavior may be related to her trying to protect the disorder.  I do my best to avoid saying my or your when referring to the eating disorder to take the identity away from the person and depersonalize the disorder.  I am first a child of God and not my identity is not an eating disorder.  So I try to take power away from the eating disorder by not giving it any power. I am glad you are there for your daughter and while she may not want your help now she may really be wanting the help but be so afraid of the process of recovery that she is pushing everyone away.  I never thought I would settle at my current weight. I was like I will never go above x amount of pounds. I am over that but am freer than I ever thought possible and happier.  I did a Bible study with a group, I have been doing a weekly study for a year. By Beth Moore called Breaking Free.  Updated version.  Very good.  I am starting Daniel July 3rd  So the fear I had of being a certain number and size was all a lie.  I had to get rid of a lot of clothes but am happy for the most part.I would love to stay in touch and know how you are doing.

Her dad and I adore her so much. She is an amazing human being. She was thriving until her trauma. That's when everything declined rapidly. We have considered power of attorney, and even getting a guardianship, but we have been advised using that approach should be only in extreme cases, where someone needs inpatient care on a feeding tube. We have been advised that the lasting successes are from the patient coming to realize that they need the help and accepting the gift of treatment. Our daughter did tell her therapist that she was tired and ready to let someone else help her.  (This will be the third time in a facility.) Since that meeting she has avoided everyone. We did receive a test message from her on Sunday...responding to all the text message we have sent over the past few weeks. She has no money. Can't find a job. Struggling to get a meal due to lack of cash. We have been depositing money in her account, but therapist advises to stop as this will force her to reach out for help. We continue to send her short uplifting messages every few days reminded her she is loved and valued. Meanwhile, we have her on every prayer list we know....and continue to pray that she will finally respond to her therapist who reaches out to her every few days. Her therapist is an amazing Christian woman who is a wounded healer. She has dealt with ED personally and overcome. She knows. No patient can fool her.My husband (her dad) and I are standing on the promises of God. We understand. We pray. We trust. We are preparing to do whatever necessary to get her the help she needs.

Very clinical, but gives you a clearer picture of what is happening. Hard to fathom, but 6 out of 10 young people from elementary school age through high school endure a traumatic experience before they even get to college of young adulthood.

28,cwb124,06/03/2019,10 year old developing eating disorder,"HI folks, new here.  Wife and I have a 10 year old son who starting around age 4-5 became VERY picky.  He used to eat the pureed vegetables we fed him as a baby and most everything else and then the wheels fell off.  He has cut his food down to a very few things.However over the last couple years he's developed what I must consider a serious eating disorder.  When nobody is awake yet or when he doesn't think anyone is around, he'll raid the cabinets for any food to be found. While this probably isn't entirely abnormal, some of the things he finds to eat perhaps is. We have recently discovered that he has pillaged out baking cabinet. Stuff that is barely edible on its own, he has cleaned out.  Whenever we go to the store, he sneaks money in his pocket and tries to buy snacks from the checkout isle.  When he discovers that we are allowing him to have a treat he gets almost anxious that he will miss out when obviously there's enough for everyone to have one.  I just see very odd eating behavior from him, and he's extremely difficult to feed.  Won't try ANYTHING new.  He's not overweight now but the way he's going if he keeps this up, he'll have serious health problems.  I am not sure what to do.

Thank you in advance.",iwanttolive,"Mon,06/03/2019-7:29pm",ginetta,"Hi.  I am sad to hear that your daughter is suffering with an eating disorder and you are having to deal with the pain of having her go to a residential facility.  I know it must be breaking your heart to see her suffer and that you can't ""fix"" her.  Eating disorders are complex and painful.  I hope you called NEDA for some suggestions.  I am sorry we are not able to give out that type of information but it really is best for you as some of us may have a good experience at a particular facility and another a terrible experience at the very same facility.  So the forum dissuades us from talking about specific places we've been.  I would suggest that you call some yourself and ask them some questions such as:  what type of therapy is used?  DBT?  CBT?  A combination?  What types of groups are run, are they mixed girls/boys women/men?  The age range and size of the groups?  The subjects of the groups.  Are the patient's allowed in their rooms during the day or evening?  How long is allowed for meals?  What is one doesn't complete their meal?  Do they teach intuitive eating?  Do they teach meal plans and are the patients allowed to choose their menu?  How often will they see the dietician?  Psychiatrist?  Therapist?  Will there be trips outside of the facility?  If the patient is of age, are they allowed out on their own for walks on grounds?   Typical length of stay?  Calls home/usage of hospitals computers for emailing?  Family therapy sessions even if done over the phone?  Are they allowed a certain amount of dislikes, foods the person does not like, usually three is the limit.  Most places do not allow vegetarian but some do, if it isn't being used as a means to control the food they eat.  This will be dealt with on an individual basis.  I am in recovery.  Been to a lot of places and all over the country.  That is why I know some questions you may want to ask when calling facilities.  You should be able to get all your questions answered.  I wish you the best and your daughter and family.  I know it isn't easy but worth the work.  I hope your daughter is motivated as it really helps if she is.  Post back with any questions.

30,staypositive,05/25/2019,How Can I Learn to Communicate Better with my Daughter after sending her to Treatment?,"We finally pulled our 16 year old from school and put her into a day program. She is mad. I betrayed her. I promised I would not put her in to a place she did not belong. She needs to be there. She doesn't see that. Somekids are severe there. She's not. She eats, now. She needs to learn how to eat enough to gain and maintain and how to have a healthy relationship with food..not the one that she believes is healthy. When people say ""eating disorder"" it's upsetting to her. I try to explain that ED encompasses a lot , not just not-eating. There are psychological components, behavioral..etc...and what she shows her parents is her distain for what we have ""to"" her...she can't see what we have done ""for"" her. She believes that she can just eat more. Exercise less. She is with drawing from friends because she doesn't want to explain where she is and why she's not at school. We love her so much and want to support her, we hope that she will understand, but she can't now. I want to control my temper when she lashes out at me and speaks harsh, I can sometimes, but not always. I want to learn how to communicate with her while she is in this new stage--the extremely angry stage. Advice?",iwanttolive,"Sun,05/26/2019-11:19pm",staypositive,"Hello and welcome to the forum.  I am glad you found us here. I am not a parent, but an adult child and someone who started out with an eating disorder when I was around your daughters age.  I am free from all forms of eating disorders for an entire year and due to the fact that I had it for so long this is celebration time.  I say this to encourage you.  My parent's were both nurses and knew what was happening.  They gave me the threat, lose one more X and in you go.   Of course I didn't believe them, that I was really ""that sick"" and how stupid they were to be sending me off to a hospital.  Well, they knew what they were doing and this was in the early 80's when very little was known about how to treat eating disorders.  You said you broke your daughters trust.  You told her that if it wasn't necessary you wouldn't make her do x y and z.  But then you said she needs this.  So, trust yourself and not her anger.  It is a very confusing time at this age.  I was only in ninth grade when I was sixteen so I wound up missing a lot of school.  You are so right on when you say an eating disorder is so much more about food and numbers and weight.  It is about learning to live in the big wild world.  I am just starting to do this at age fifty-one because I was paralyzed by fear of living.  So I existed for most of my life.  You are doing the most loving thing you know how to do for your daughter.  She may not see it now but she will understand one day.  I know you are scared, probably a bit angry, and frustrated.  I suggest trying to not get into battles over food.  Let the professionals help her with that.  See if you can just let her know that you are there for her if she ever wants to talk.  She may be too angry right now, but keep up letting her know that if she ever needs to talk with you about anything you are there for her.  Get help for yourself.  It is tremendously difficult for parent's to go through this terrifying illness.  Do you have friends to support you?  Can you see your own therapist for a while?  About your anger, I think you need to understand what it is about.  Is it fear based, or not knowing how to help your daughter as you see her self destruct?  Do you have a faith based community where you can draw support from?  I know without my faith in Jesus and my Christian friends and parents I would not be alive today.
I hope this helps some.  I know I am not a parent, but my Mom and I have talked about what my experience did to her and how she cried herself to sleep a lot.  My Dad would be afraid to come home from his trips while he was a pilot.  But there is Hope.  Never give up and let your daughter know that you are never going to give up on her.  Maybe you can do some things together now that the weather is nicer.  Does she want to do anything with you at this point?She will learn all about how food isn't the main issue with eating disorders.   I was so angry when people would tell me this.  I was more than angry. I was thinking you are so dumb.   But now I know the truth and it goes so much deeper than food, calories and etc.  It is about learning to live life and how to deal with the stuff life throws at us.

31,molly123,05/23/2019,New to this ,"Hi, my 15 year old daughter has been struggling with bulemia for about 7 months now. She came to me about two months ago asking for help. Admitted that it was getting out of control and she was scared. After going to numerous psychologists, we finally found one that specializes in eating disorders and she has started therapy (once a week). We've only been twice so far so I haven't seen any changes this soon.  I think she uses behaviors at least 4 times a week if not more. She uses behaviors right in front of me,  she doesn't hide her disordered eating. It is so heartbreaking when I see her doing it,  especially when I know what she will do next after the eating is done. I get so frustrated, sometimes I just want to tell her to please stop eating, but I know I shouldn't do that. Another problem is that her best friend has an eating disorder(sometimes I wonder if she has a lot to do with what my daughter is going through now) the friend was self harming back during the summer and I found out my daughter had started to self harm around Thanksgiving. She did that for about two months.  That's when the eating disorder started. Her friend also convinced her that smokimg would help with her anxiety and food cravings. I found out that my daughter had bought one from a kid at school and has been using it for about a month now. Is it wrong of me to wish that this friend would move to the other side of the world?? Ugh I just don't know how to handle all of this. Any advice is appreciated.",iwanttolive,"Thu,05/23/2019-5:06pm",molly123,"Hello concerned Mom. NO it is not wrong to want this person to move to the other side of the world.  I speak as a recovered adult who dealt with eating disorders and self harm for a very long time.  My parent are both nurses and knew right away what was going on, even though my issues stared in the 80's.  The fact that this ""friend""  also suffers from  an eating disorder and another is helping her got whatever substance they are, is concerning.  I personally would to limit their contact as much as possible.  If you know who is getting this stuff for her, you can report them.  It may be illegal what they are selling her.  That would be one way of dealing with that issue.  As far as your daughter using behaviors in front of you, to me, it sounds like anger.  Do you know if she is dealing with anger issues?   Do you know if she is still self harming?  If she is, it is highly addictive.  It actually changes the brain chemistry and gives off a calming sensation which is why some engage in this behavior.  I did for many years until I finally stopped one year ago.  Do you think once a week therapy is enough at this point?  Have you considered a partial hospital day program, PHP?  She would have help up to five days a week six hours a day, some provide more days and hours.   Once a week initially may not be enough.I understand you are scared and don't know what to do.  NEDA is great in helping parents and others navigate through this scary time.  On the site National Eating Disorder Association, there is a section called Parent Tool Kit.  It is filled with a lot of ideas, suggestions, explains the different types of eating disorders and may really help you a lot.

32,MurphysLaw,04/23/2019,Anyone else in a holding pattern or plateau,"My daughter is 17 and struggled with an ED for almost 2 years now.  She was never hospitalized but lost significant weight over a 3 month span and ended up passing out at her lowest weight.  She has been seeing a therapist who has been instrumental in her recovery.  That being said - it seems she is in a holding pattern - physically out of danger and for that I am so thankful and grateful, but emotionally stuck.  Not sure that really makes sense??  She just had a physical and was back up in the 30% for girls her age so that is amazing progress but it's more of what goes through her mind that concerns me.  I realize recovery is not linear and that you can't flip a switch but I guess I was naive in hoping there would be a time when it would be behind us or that I could selfishly put it down.  I try very hard NOT to powerstruggle about food choices but then I find myself thinking ""Really???  You are going to try to have this for snack - like are you kidding me???""  But then I realize well her friends all ate the same thing so that is pretty normal that she would ask for them.
 And I know it's not about a rice cake - it's about control, shame, independence. progress, setbacks and so much more.
In talking with her therapist I know that any judgement or frustration is so counter productive yet sometimes I fall into a mode where I want her to realize how hard I am working - BUT then I think wow if this is hard for me and she doesn't want to hurt me it must be so hard for her.  I am just wondering how other parents continue to support their teens - or how they find ways to separate what is a ""normal"" teen attitude and what is food restriction or active resistance?  I try to support her but I know she perceives my frustration which makes me feel guilty b/c I know that is detrimental to her progress.  Should I take a step back and be patient and thankful or keep nudging her forward.????
Thanks for any advice",BobJ48,"Thu,04/25/2019-5:26pm",Murphy's,"You're right in not wanting the situation to turn into a power struggle, but at the same time, I suspect that your daughter might admit that as a parent, it's reasonable for you to be concerned.   Also, if it seems to you that she's still struggling emotionally, that's probably a reasonable assumption too, even though she continues with therapy. One thing you might want to do is ask her how she would like you to support her.  Granted she might say ""Just leave me alone"" but it's also possible that she could have some suggestions.   It would be worth a try, I think, and something which might show her that you are on the same side that she is.I know that you may have already tried this, but try not to settle for a knee-jerk response.  She if you can seriously have her give you some suggestions. It won't hurt to let her know that you understand the ""one step forward, and another step backwards"" part too. Recovery can be frustrating for her as well as for yourself.  So hopefully the two of you can forgive each other for that part as well. Anyhow, just some suggestions. It's great that she seems to be recovering, but it's also normal if she finds herself struggling with those old urges and those old self-judgments as well.",sacreddad,"Tue,05/07/2019-1:53pm",holding pattern,"Murphy's,
Not sure I have any helpful advice...just the fact that your not alone. I read your post and it was almost looking in a mirror.  My 12 year old was in intensive care October 2018, after a 2 month spiral.  She has been back home and out of outpatient since February.  Everything now is similar to your situation, she is out of danger but holding steady.  A small drop or small gain.  As this all began when puberty and normal teenage attitude began, I also sometimes am not sure which is normal teenage rebellion, and what is the ED.  I call my fiends with similar aged children but no ED, and some of the behavior is the same, back talk, and being mean to younger siblings, so there is definitely some co-mingling.  I do find times that she is talkative (definitely not during meals) where we can have a heart to heart, and it is at that moment where I try and get all the answers I am searching for.  So when you see that she is talkative and looking for some heart to heart, stop everything and find a place where the two of you can get the answers together.  Also I have put the ED books aside for the moment and am reading on Anxiety in adolescent girls.  It is an epidemic and from just speaking to parents with and without ED issues in their children, its incredible and sad to just see the numbers of people who are dealing with this issue.

My daughter is 19 and has struggled with an ED for ~3 years.  Last year she spent 10 days in the hospital, and we hoped that would be the wakeup call that really changed her life.  She did much better for sure, and was able to start college where academically she has excelled.  But eventually the old habits crept back in and now I fear she is back in the same place as last year.  I cycle through emotional stages of hope, acceptance, frustration, sadness, and anger.  Everyone I talk to about it (which isn't many people) has ideas or reassuring words, but it doesn't really help so I just try to avoid the conversation.  From what I have read on this forum, the people posting here really get where me and my family are living.  I have been wanting to post here for awhile, but the feelings are so hard to write down.It is a helpless feeling to watch a loved one suffer, but I have come to a point where I realize she isn't going to get better unless she makes that choice to get better.  I can't force her (believe me, I wish I could).  All manner of help, counseling, programs, medical staff, etc have been made available.  She even has people in her life that have personally struggled with ED (peers and mentors) that she will talk with.  And all of the counselors and people who have experienced this have said that she has to decide to change, she has to decide to get better.  Please......someone tell me if this is wrong?  Someone tell me there is a magic program or trick we haven't yet tried?I haven't answered any questions for you, rather I suspect I'm asking all the same ones myself.

My 12 year old at times looks at me with confused eyes and I know she can not do this on her own.

Because when people have anxiety (particularly GAD, which feels all encompassing, rather than situational)   they can feel helpless, as it really can be a thing that feels beyond their control.   And so what do you turn to, in order to feel more  in control ?  Back to the one thing that has become mentally associated with feeling in control - Your eating disorder.  Your ED can feel like something you could actually use to fight your anxiety, so there is a certain logic to it.   Although it rarely works out that way.So it can become a vicious circle alright.  From your reading, you probably know more about it than I do.   But yes, people with EDs can often be victims of generalized anxiety too.

34,dumbdad,04/25/2019,"Daughter in recovery, now struggling w/ weight gain","Been quite a while since I've posted on here. My now 18 year old daughter struggled with anorexia, has been doing very well in recovery for over 2 years. She is currently out of the country on an extended mission trip. She has had lots of anxiety while away on this trip. Recently her anxiety has been focused on how much weight she has gained (which is real, and not distorted by her). It has been very difficult for my wife and myself trying to work through her issues with her from half way around the world. We are struggling with how to talk to her about her weight gain, without possibly enabling her falling back into her ED. She has said some worrisome thing along the lines of being angry with us for making gain weight while she was sick, because then she was at least in control, and now she feels like she has no self-control and no will-power when it comes to food. She says she is over-eating, particularly late at night, and making unhealthy choices (junk food, sweets etc)when she does it. Trying to talk to her about without inadvertently enabling her disorder is tricky. Any suggestions on how to deal with these issues?",BobJ48,"Thu,04/25/2019-11:58am",Dad.,"(I read your posts on the other forum)As IWTL said, it's easy for people to become concerned about weight gain.  ""Concerned"" may not quite encompass their feelings, but perhaps you know what I mean.  Such thoughts may try and take over, is probably more what I mean.  And how we (as folks who are not them) can influence that process (particularly from a distance) can be a difficult thing.In this case, she really had put a lot of effort into getting herself on this mission.  The fact that she's made it is a positive thing, which is something you might encourage her to reflect on.  Because it really is an accomplishment that she can be proud of.Having said that, one other thought that people with EDs are often plagued by is the ""good enough"" thing.  Granted, perhaps they've brought themselves to a point of achievement, but will they really ever be ""good enough""?   The sorts of high standards they can hold themselves to can be close to impossible for normal humans to achieve, so that's something to keep in mind too.  It's possible that while she's actually doing good work, she could also be berating herself for not doing better.  Which can evolve into self-doubt and self-hate, particularly if combined with self-disappointment from weight gain.So you'll want to be aware of the sort of delicate balance that may be going on here.  On the one hand you'll want to congratulate her on all that she's accomplished, because she really does need to give herself credit for that part.  While on the other had keeping in mind that she may be plagued by thoughts that she's not ""being perfect"".  What I mean is, it won't hurt for you to acknowledge that you understand that part too.  The ""We're only human"" part, I mean.In any case, see what you can do to balance those two things when you talk with her.  The idea that you ""get it"" about some of the emotional doubts that she may be facing will go a long way towards her feeling authentically understood and supported.Bob J.",dumbdad,"Wed,05/01/2019-1:06pm","thanks for the reply.

35,JustWantMyDBack,04/09/2019,Making the decision to go residential,"Hi everyone,I'm looking for advice on making the decision to enroll my daughter in a residential program for Anorexia.She is 14yr old and was diagnosed in January 2018 (15 months ago).  She did an 11 day hospital stay and we've been managing her illness with the support of an FBT therapist.  Actually multiple:  we originally spent the first 8 months with one via an FBT research study, then we stayed on our own for a while, and now we have a new therapist and a dietician that we really like.We've been able to keep her weight stable and close to her targets, but her anorexic behaviors and willingness to see this as an illness that she wants to fight have not budged.  In some ways, things are worse now than when she first got out of the hospital.  Then, she was eager to do what it took to get her freedoms back, but now she's depressed and has resigned herself to us ""controlling her life"" (her perception) and there's no light at the end of the tunnel for her.On the other side, my wife and I are so incredibly burnt out... plating her food, having lunches with her at school, taking tons of time off work for therapist/dietician/medical appointments, having the predictable arguments and dealing with the tantrums (including the rage-filled moments where she'll get violent and start hitting (anger mgmt issues as well)) is taking a major toll on us and the family as a whole since this process has gone on for so long.  We keep hearing that if she gets to and can stay at some magic weight that eventually she'll start to shift her mindset and we just don't see that happening and are losing hope.  :-(My question for the community is at what point, and how did you come to the decision for your child that home care wasn't going to work, and that you needed to enroll your daughter in a residential program?  And if you did, how did it turn out and would you do it again?I know that we can't talk about particular programs here, but I'd also be interested to know based on your experiences what kinds of questions I should be asking to ensure we get a good fit should we decide to go this route.Thanks in advance,David",iwanttolive,"Tue,04/09/2019-10:25pm",JustWantMyDBack,"Hello.  I am not a parent. I am one who has been in residential.  I am really sorry for all that you have been going through.  When I was going through treatment, FBT didn't exist.  I don't know how well I would have coped with it with my mindset.  I hear how incredibly tired you are and how hard you have tried.  I give you a lot of credit and I thank you for all you have done for your daughter.  It has to be so difficult.  For residential, I would see how long it lasts.  Some last a few weeks, some, I was in one for six months.  So they are all very different.  I would want to know if they work towards intuitive eating which teaches the individual to learn when they are hungry and full, but that takes time after weight restoration.  Also, I would ask what type of therapy they use, CBT, DBT, how many times a week they get individual therapy and for how long.  If they are a part of developing what they will be eating or are they given a plate of food not knowing each meal.  How often they will meet with the dietician.  Will they get to know their weight at any point in the process.  What happens if they don't complete a meal?  What are the consequences.  How long they have to complete a meal.  Are they allowed in their rooms during the day or evening?  What are the ages of the others, co-ed or not.  What types of groups will be held, what a typical day looks like.  Will there be trips outside of the facility during the stay.  Are they allowed dislikes, I was allowed three foods I didn't like, not fear foods, real dislikes.  How much do they involve you guys as parent's.  How much will they discuss with you without her permission being that she is a minor.  These are just a few questions I can think of.  I also wouldn't pick a facility for distance sake but for how good it is.  Often some place aren't as good as others and if you can find a place that you like, even though it may be difficult, if it is a good one but further away than you would like I would consider going to the one that best suits your daughter.   It has to be extremely difficult to have one so young dealing with such a serious illness.  If you believe in God, involve Him as much as you can in your decision making process.  For me, my healing finally came when I was able to give all my fears and control over to Jesus and finally be free from this.  My parent's love and care and forcing me into programs when I didn't want to go, and then the adult me finally  accepting responsibility and saying no to the eating disorder and yes to what Jesus wanted for me brought about my ultimate healing.    Please let us know how things go and know you are not alone.  I am sorry I spoke not as a parent, but I hope I was able to offer some insight.iwanttolive and I am",mauricio.malago...,"Wed,04/17/2019-10:42am",Making the decision to go to residential,"Hello, and I am sorry for what you are going through and understand what you are going through. My 12 year old daughter went through similar situation September 2018 She was admitted to a hospital for 2 weeks.  She was then transferred to an inpatient facility. Its a little different I imagine then residential but more or less the same.  As this was all new to me, I don't really remember being asked, but rather told that this was next logical step.  I absolutely advise AGAINST any inpatient program.  After fighting for 2 weeks in the hospital to not have a feed tube inserted, the inpatient facility inserted 1 after 1 night.  My daughter spent 2 weeks there and she was miserable throughout.  Myself and my ex-wife were there every day visiting and saw how the employees treated the patients horriblly.  They were treated like prisoners, and with absolutely no respect.  We were treated worse simply for visiting, as they had now work instead of hiding in their offices and reading.  My daughter is back home after 3 months at an outpatient facility and is going through research program as well.  Every day is a challenge but she is maintaining her weight.  She also does not believe that she has a problem which makes it even more difficult.

36,scaredmom1322,11/19/2018,"The at HOME help that no Doctor, Psychologist, or Psychiatrist can give me","HI! My name is Amy, and I am the mother of a 12 year old girl that is suffering from anorexia. My daughter's struggle begin last spring when she started losing weight because a boy started teasing her about being a FAT COW!!! She begin this journey weighing in the triple digits last spring, to a low double digit as of recent. I took her to the Doctor in May 2018 with concerns and the Pediatrician told me she was in the normal weight range and her BMI was in normal range, and I got told she was an active girl, and was doing just fine!!! That was when things slowly begin to slip. I told the Pediatrician it wasn't the fact that she was in ""normal range"" it was that she had lost a certain number of pounds which is a HUGE weight loss for a child in the 6th grade. He assured me, that there was NOTHING wrong with her, of course in my heart I knew differently.The summer went on, and the weight continued to poor off of her. They told me that I would need to bring her back to the Doctor for a three month check up and lab work and I decided to try taking her to a Family Medicine Professional instead of the Pediatrician.In August 2018 she was down again, and the Family Medicine Doctor thought it was time to have her see a Clinical Psychologist. She begin seeing a Clinical Psychologist August 6, 2018. During the first 6 weeks of the visits with the Clinical Psychologist were spent with my daughter, the Psychologist, my husband, and myself. WE would go to sessions and I would do 95% of the talking and I wasn't sure why she wasn't spending any individual time with our daughter.She started seeing her alone, and some sessions were good, and some were not productive at all.....She felt it was appropriate to move her visits to bi-weekly with her progression. My daughter seems to relate o.k. to the Psychologist but, I am not convinced she is 100% the best fit. I would like her to spend more time with her, and less time visiting with us (mom and dad)Approx, 2 weeks ago she had a re-check up and it didn't go so well this time. She was directly admitted from the Clinic to the hospital for dehydration and low BP. She was back down to her double digit low. Her lab work came back perfect, EKG's came back normal, and she HATED being in the hospital.She stayed two nights, and she was very sad while there. It was very scary for all of us.
She is now seeing a Psychiatrist, Psychologist, and and doing weekly weigh-ins. She says she wants to get better, says she is too skinny, but her behaviors show otherwise. She does the sneaky things at meal time. (Dropping food, throws it away when not looking)
But, desperately says she wants to get better. I am looking for at HOME advice.....
-We are currently doing a meal plan of 6 meals per day.
(Small meals)
-What do other parents do to encourage their child to eat?
-How do you find a fine line between Screaming and yelling to not saying much of anything at all?
-Do any parents use reward systems for their child?
-We are currently using POSITIVE reinforcement every time she does something good, but it just doesn't seem to be enough
-How do parents Cope with the moods and depression
-Have parents tried an anti-depressant and has it been successful for them and their family.
-What tips can you give me to make the home life more comfortable for my family and II know this is a lot of information but I am looking for support. Any information and help is much appreciated.
Thank-you!!

Good luck",iwanttolive,"Thu,03/28/2019-11:34am",scaredmom1322,"Hello and welcome to the forum.  I am so very sorry for your pain and for the suffering of your daughter.  I am sorry that the doctors don't listen to Mom's who know their children and instead treat people like things.  It is such a shame that while you were trying so hard to get your daughter who you knew needed help were told, ""she is fine"".  You knew better and now are dealing with her health issues that are even more serious. I am not a mother, but I know one. Mine.  She dealt with me in the years I dealt with a serious eating disorder with my father.  They were both active nurses at the time.  I am told how I was very angry and extremely difficult. When I was so sick back initially in the mid 80's, there was little known about treatment in hospitals or out.  Now more is known, but not enough.  It is a shame because as you know, eating disorders are difficult to treat, and the sufferers are difficult to live with, even when they are your child.  The anger and rage again is more about her fear about what is happening to her and her fear of gaining weight.  As sufferers, we have a NEED to protect that at any cost.  Even if that means lying when that was never a part of us ever.  We don't really do it on purpose.  It is to protect what we think is keeping us safe and from what we don't always know.  For me it was being shy, being abused by my sister at home that my parent's weren't aware of.  Or the extent of.  It was fear of being attacked. It was fear of going to school where I was bullied.  It was fear of growing up and not knowing how to adapt to the changes going on in my body.  It was fear from seeing what was happening in my sisters lives.  I have four sisters, all of whom have been abused and physically, emotionally and/or sexually.  I didn't want that to happen to me.  The world of eating disorders was safer or so I thought.  So I did anything to keep it.   And keep it I did for decades.  I am now free from all forms of the eating disorder and all self harm.  For you.   My Mom and Dad loved me.  They put my butt in hospitals when necessary to keep me alive.  They prayed a lot.  And many others did as well.  They educated themselves as best they could.  They listened to me, they explained to me why my body needed food.  When one's body becomes malnourished the brain doesn't work properly.  It sees things that aren't there, such as fat on ones body.  The brain becomes addicted to starvation as one becomes addicted to drugs.  So as another mother pointed out, one of the best ""drugs"" your daughter needs right now is food.  To help her think more clearly.  To focus better.  To have less anger.  To understand why she is angry, besides just having to eat and gain weight.  To understand what gaining weight means to her.  If she is being bullied at school.  Being called names.  Being teased for her weight initially.  That is really hard to hear.  Especially these days when most people thing being thin is the answer to all problems.  They are wrong.  Today I am 51 and am at a higher weight than I ever thought I would settle on.  I am happier though than I ever thought I would be. I am active in life, leading a Bible study at my home, taking a class at my community college, involved in church working part time.  I am truly living and I was so afraid to live for so may years I found it safer to live in hospitals and hide out in day programs.  But my faith in Jesus and finally being able to trust Him with my fears and surrendering to Him my fears has helped me to be able to say no to the eating disorder and self harm.  I am two and a half years free from the anorexia and ten months form all other forms of self harm and eating disorders.  For you, loving your daughter, getting help for yourself, support for you and your husband, you need others to help you go through this.  You can not do it alone.  NEDA has great resources and are available to talk to when you have questions or need support.  Posting here is a good thing.  Ask your daughter what she needs from you.  Let her know you are there no matter what.  Her moods and anger are a result again I believe in part from fear.   Fear of the anorexia being taken away from her.  She will need to learn other ways to cope.  Other things to look to to help her deal with her fears and pain.  Therapy is there to help her with that.  If you go down that route.  I hope you get help in knowing what is best for her and yourselves.  I do not know what your faith backround is but mine is Christianity.  If you can find a good youth group where she can find some other teens to meet with on  a weekly basis with a hopefully good youth leader is one idea.  Again, I do not know your faith backround but for me, that is why I am alive today, my faith in Jesus.  Even today, or last night, I needed to cry out to Him to help me deal with some feelings that were uncomfortable.  He did.  It isn't always easy but I am maintaining my recovery.  I again am sorry you are going through this very painful time.  I pray your daughter gets the help she needs and is able to move forward in healing and health.  If you haven't see if you can get the help of a dietician to help you know how many calories your daughter needs to gain and then she is still growing and will need to continue to gain or maintain as she grows.  So having a good dietician will be helpful.  Or a medical doctor who understands eating disorders and meal plans.  Maybe having her have some input into what she eats, as long as it isn't low calorie and is what is needed.  She may not be there yet.  As for rewards, initially it may work but she is going to have to learn to want to recover and giving her reasons why and understanding her fears about her need for needing the anorexia I think are key.  There are usually always reasons an eating disorder develops.  Understanding those and finding out why are key.  Family therapy at her age is also very helpful.  I believe in letting her know what is and is not acceptable, such as screaming and yelling.  But a therapist would be helpful in helping you know how to handle these things.  I am not a therapist.  I only know from experience that fear played a big role in why I stayed ill for so long.  I also didn't know that my first ""diet"" would take me down the road it did.  You are from what I see a loving and caring mother and I will pray for you that you get the best help possible for your daughter and for yourself.  Please post anytime and know you are not alone.  I know my response was long.  I am sorry.  I hope it was of some help.  Take care and post anytime.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,mauricio.malago...,03/23/2019,Orthorexia/anorexia,"Hello everyone and thanks for being on this site. First time I ever joined a forum. Let’s get right to the point. My 12 year old daughter was diagnosed with orthopedic/anorexia nervous while in the ICU. She did 2 weeks in hospital, 2 weeks inpatient, 3 months outpatient. She is finally back at home. I am a father and divorced 50/50% custody.   Meals are difficult as you can imagine and with orthorwxia even more as I don’t necessarily disagree with eating healthy and my daughter has no issue with her weight, actually is happy when she maintains or even gains, to get out of the programs.  Still she is anorexic as she needed hospitalization.  My ex and I are amicable and on the same page usually. My issue is this and all help is appreciated. My ex has issues with all programs my daughter has entered. She has shown disdain for all medical professionals in front of our daughter and feels she is not getting the correct treatment.  This in turns emboldens my daughter to feel she is right in thinking these programs are useless and Shenzhen knows what she is doing.  I have had my issues with her treatment teams throughout but the difference is, I have absorbed much information about the disease and the treatment and understand their plan. My ex wife and daughter feels she needs emotional therapy and that the concentration thus far has only been on her relationship with food.  I’ve explained the whole “anxiety wont kill her/ but an ED will”
Now we were accepted into a research program but now the ex is finds no issues with this as well and in front of my daughter again so she will feel like she can quit with her mother’s blessing.  Her mom now says that the only good treatment are the ones that I simply can’t afford. I do not believe that money is the answer and the more you spend the better therapy you will receive.   How do I get an ex wife to read and understand why solving the disordered eating is the first and most important issue to confront instead of just saying it is not enough.  We are finally going to receive some FBT and learn how to help feed our daughter.  It seems they argue a lot when she is feeding her and she is giving up. My daughter entered the hospital in November 2018 after a very rapid amount of weight loss in less than a certain amount of time. Any help is greatly appreciated",BobJ48,"Sun,03/24/2019-10:32pm",Maruricio,"It's not uncommon for parents to be frustrated - EDs can seem mysterious, and the idea that there is no specific ""cure"" that can be counted on to work doesn't add much to the frustration.  This can lead to people questioning pretty much everything.  All those hot-shot professionals and all of the time and the energy involved - A person can look for someone to blame.It sounds like your wife has found herself in that position.None the less, it doesn't help matters for your wife to be questioning all this in front of your daughter.  As you may suspect, attitude makes a big difference, and for your wife to seemingly encourage your daughter to doubt the helpfulness of the programs that are out there ; perhaps even she might agree that that's not the best stance to encourage. On the plus side, if you do decide to pursue FBT, it's quite likely that the parental counseling that's a part of this will address some of the issues you mention, and help your wife better understand the positions that she'll need to take.  Granted, meal times can be difficult, but that pretty much comes with the territory, and hopefully the FBT folks will help your wife with her concerns as she works at dealing  with that part.  In the mean time, yes : treatment can be a ""long haul"" sort of thing, and being able to keep one's feet on the ground and remain optimist is one of the more important roles for a parent. Because someone needs to remain steady and forward-thinking with this, in the face of the many frustrations involved.  It's an important and appropriate role for all parents.",mauricio.malago...,"Mon,03/25/2019-12:30pm",orthorexia/anorexia,BobJ48- Thanks for your insight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,WorriedMom13,02/16/2019,Any help appreciated,"My son is 13. He has been a picky eater since he started eating solid food pretty much. Over time, it has gotten much worse. He will say he is hungry, but nothing sounds good. No matter what I suggest, I usually hear, ""That doesn't sound good."" He will eat only about a dozen things. And food items keep dropping off the list. He used to like a certain food, but won't eat it anymore-no good reason-he says he doesn't like it. He is NOT intentionally anorexic. He WANTS to eat, but can't force himself to if something doesn't 'sound good' to him. Feeding him is my number one worry and stress. He ends up eating alot of fast food because that is what I can get him to eat at times and he doesn't like more than a couple of things I make. He is now starting to say he doesn't like fast food-so the list is dwindling even smaller. He is in a certain percentile in weight for his age/height. He also hates this. He is a very anxious child and exhibits some OCD tendencies.
I have never heard of this type of eating disorder issue before. His doctor doesn't seem to be much help. I have had him to counseling for anxiety and that didn't help at all. I feel this may be a brain chemistry issue and don't know where to turn. Has anyone else had an issue similar to this?",iwanttolive,"Tue,02/19/2019-10:56pm",WorriedMom13,"Hi.  I am sorry you are having such difficulties with your son.  He says he isn't anorexic but if he isn't eating and is refusing food, that is a problem, as you know.  AFRID.  That is an eating disorder where suffers can only eat certain foods.  I think it is called AFRID.  You would do good if you spoke or chatted with a NEDA volunteer.  They can help you more than I can and give you advice I can't.  I wish I could offer you more.  I am sure it is scary for you and you worry a lot.  Do you have other children?  How are they doing with this?   It may not be an eating disorder.  It may be a sensory issue where certain foods are just not tolerated.  I would suggest talking with a NEDA volunteer and they may be able to point you in the right direction.  I am glad you posted and hope you get the help you need.

39,caringdaddy0325,07/29/2018,My DD is ill and I feel helpless and hopeless,"Hi
I have a 17 year old daughter that has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and anorexia. For the past couple of years i thought something was wrong but could not figure it out and my dd had not been forthcoming to her therapist.  Last month i found out my dd had been harming herself over a 6 month period, drinking, smoking, sneaking out of the house, lying, manipulating, dieting and exercising ( she is thin ) being promiscuous and she has a 4.0 GPA taking all honors and ap classes and plays to high school sports.
She has been in a PHP day program for about 4 weeks, last week stopped eating over the weekend because she had ex-boyfriend trouble and ended up in the hospital for dehydration.
I am so lost.  I don't know how to handle meal times on the weekends and evenings when she is not at program.  I have her meal plan, list of food and exchanges but she is picky, does not want to eat and I want to make food she will eat and likes.  It's a vicious circle.  She will eat when we go to a restaurant but that's not sustainable.  I don't understand.
She sits on her phone and the couch, barely talks and has told my wife that she has done a lot of ""bad things"" and has shame, but she is not willing to share this.  I believe it will help her get out of shame by getting it off her chest.  I honestly don't care what she's done or has happened.  i believe she can develop better morals, values and charater traits going forward.
She asked the Dr. to discharge her tomorrow.  She has been there for 4 weeks and barely seems like anything is different about her.  It seems like she thinks her way to wellness almost delusional but her behaviour and actions don't really seem like that.
I really don't know where to begin or what to do. Seems like i just want to help her eat and stay alive.  Seems like such a low bar.  Please help me with suggestions, insight and direction.  I am struggling.  I need some reality from a person in this forum that has similar experience or situation.
Thank you so much.",iwanttolive,"Sun,07/29/2018-8:00pm",caringdaddy0325,"Hello and welcome to the forum.  First, I am so sorry for your pain.  For your daughters pain.  This is no simple matter.  It is as complicated as you wrote.  From someone who has suffered with eating disorders, starting with anorexia, now recovered, I also was seriously self harming.  It is so painful for parent's to watch their daughter's suffer.  One thing you need to understand is that you can be there for DD. But you can not change her.  You can support her, let her know you love her, but she has to want to change.  Dishonesty and lying are common with this disorder.  It is a way of protecting it from being ""taken away"" from the sufferer.  Shame is another biggie.  From what you have said, it sounds like she is suffering from shame and it is most difficult talking about these things.  Unfortunately, no one can make her talk about what is truly bothering her.  Not until she is ready.  What would be a good thing for you and your wife to do is get help for yourselves.  Get some therapy perhaps.  It is so important that this doesn't affect your relationship.  Having a sick child can do this.  Getting therapy to help you both work through any false guilt you may have at not being able to ""fix"" your daughter may be very helpful.  My parent's couldn't fix me.  I was in many hospitals.  They didn't fix me.  They saved my life by getting me stable.  Yes.  But it didn't make me better until I decided I wanted to get better and then it was a journey after that.  Giving up old ways of coping and working hard at giving up old behaviors and patterns.  It took time.  I am not saying therapy won't help your daughter. It can help a lot.  The hospitalizations and day programs can be immensely helpful.  But it may take more than one time.  When your daughter realizes she is tired of this lifestyle, and really is ready to be honest, then you love her.  You tell her you are there for her when she is ready.  It is very unfortunate that love alone can't make one eat.  There is such fear of gaining weight that that fear takes over all reasoning.  Therapy can help one understand why they are focusing on that fear and find out what lies underneath the fear.  The eating disorder and other behaviors are used to deal with hurts, pain, insecurities, being bullied, not feeling deserving of being happy and any assortment of things that come up in therapy that people try to cover up the pain by using all these behaviors.  I hope this makes sense.  Then when malnutrition sets in, one can not think clearly anymore.  The brain needs nutrition to think properly.  That would be when being put through a refeeding program comes in.  To nourish the brain and body so the brain can think clearly enough to be able to sort through traumas or other things that cause one to turn to eating disorders, drugs, promiscuity and other behaviors.  There is hope.  She is young.  Eating disorders are serious but recovery is possible.  The thing is is that your daughter needs to come to a point where she wants it.  So, sorry this is so long.  Love her, you may need to set up boundaries, which a therapist would come in handy to help you with that, and let her know you are there for her when she wants to talk.  I am sorry for your pain.  I can tell you love your daughter and are confused and feel helpless.  Being a dad, I am not, but have one, and not being able to fix your children is maddening.  I know as I have watched my  father do this not just with me but some of my other sisters as well.  But there is hope.  Don't give up.  I am glad you posted and please let us know how things are going.  For now,iwanttolive",caringdaddy0325,"Sun,07/29/2018-10:29pm",DD has ED,"Thank you iwanttolive!  I needed to hear what you have written.  I am hearing that she must really want to get healthy and recover or she won't.  She needs to speak her shame to heal herself and do this in safety, BUT she has to really want to do this and really want to be healthy.
I am scared, very scared.  Tomorrow in therapy I am going to ask her where she is with wanting to recover?  I will listen and love her.  I fear so much right now.  My wife goes out of town for 5 days.  Emotionally I am so tired.

It seems that your daughter is giving you conflicting information on how she is doing.  I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you.  It seems that you are taking care of yourself and that is good to hear.  Remember that this is her journey.  You can offer support and love, but as you have heard before, she needs to want to get better.  You can have boundaries if she is living with you, and this would be something to discuss with her therapist.  Not as punishment, but to help the both of you.  This is a serious illness as you know so it is good that she is seeing her treatment team and if you have any concerns, you can tell them, they just may not be able to discuss her treatment with you, but I think it is okay if you tell them if you have concerns.  I am sorry you are all still struggling with this.  NEDA have volunteers you can talk with also if you need to.  Take care for now and I am  sorry I couldn't offer more help.  iwanttolive",caringdaddy0325,"Thu,01/10/2019-2:01pm",My DD and her ED,this is helpful.  I may call neda for support.  I appreciate your responses as they have been helpful and important.,PaulShipmanSmith,"Tue,02/26/2019-6:33pm",DD,"Your daughter is going through a very difficult time and this must be hard for you as a parent to witness her go through with this.
  You mention her college and sporting achievements which indicate that your daughter is very talented.  However, it is not uncommon for anyone who is succeeding at whatever they do to feel an element of isolation from their peer groups.  Success can, at times be rather lonely.  There could also be a lot of stress involved.
  Your daughter has been diagnosed as having depression, anxiety and anorexia.  All these conditions could result in her not being too forthcoming with her therapist.  She would be more than clever enough to hide the self-harming, drinking, smoking and so on from her therapist.
   The drinking and smoking could be her way of trying to be part of the crowd she is either hanging out with, or trying hard to be part of.
  She knows that you are not going to be very approving of her leaving the house to partake in whatever adventures she is undertaking when out your sight.  Hence, she ends up sneaking out of the house in the belief that you will be none the wiser.
  Her lying, manipulating and self-harming must be a worry for you.  The self-harming will need addressing in therapy and will take time to explore because of the deep emotions that cause the self-harm.
   The dieting and exercising is good in moderation and if done sensibly under professional guidance such as the gym.  However, many young people - and all age groups - find themselves taking it to more extreme levels
  Our society today is so much based upon the influence of visual social media.  At one time, teenagers were influenced by the TV and magazines for their 'role models'.  Now, with the internet, it is 'full-on' 24/7.
    Your daughter could be experiencing a high level of stress due to her working hard at college.  Many of us don't express the fact that we are suffering from stress in our lives.
    You mention problems with her ex-boyfriend. Is she having serious difficulty moving on or handling the ending of this relationship with him?
    Your daughter also does seem to be trying hard to find a way of wanting help.  Her boyfriend trouble has lead her to stop eating and end up being hospitalised.  There does seem to be an issue where she is using food - or denial of food - as a means of expressing her inner feelings.
  Your daughter wants to eat in public such as restaurants yet won't eat the food you put on the table in front of her.  OK...She is willing to eat when she does want to.
  There is the possibility however, that your daughter does not want to show her troubles when out in public places.
     There is certainly the possibility that your daughter is not being forthcoming with what is happening in her life.  She does seem to be trying to tell you what is wrong by saying that she has done 'bad things'.  The problem here is that she is not ready to openly share this with you.
        A counsellor/therapist will be able to help her with discussing the the issues about the  shame and bad things.  She will then learn how to deal with these issues over time.  Much of what she is trying to visually express could be discussed with a therapist who fully understands what your daughter is trying hard to say.
    The only person who can really help your daughter is herself at the end of the day.  She is going through a very difficult time and all you can do is continue with what you are doing to help her through it all.  That is be there for her when times are hardest and support her as best as you can.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am glad you reached out for support.  Everyone at one time or another gets a moderator editing out something written at one time or another so don't worry about that.  I am  just glad you reached out for support and want to help your daughter.  That is one of the best things you can do for her, to let her know that you are there for her, that she trusts you and you are being supportive.  It is a shame your country doesn't have more help for those struggling with these issues.  One thing that might be helpful is to go online and check out some self help books on the topic.  I can not recommend any specific books as we are not allowed to but NEDA may have some ideas.  You can chat with them and they also have a lot of good resources on their web site.  It is wonderful that you are being so supportive, but you also need to take care of yourself.  There is a topic, tool kit for parent's that may be helpful here on this site.  Also, maybe reading over some of the other posts to see what others have done to work on their recovery.   There are recovery stories on the web site as well.

42,nadanana,01/16/2019,Diarrhea in recovery?,"Hi, I’m currently helping my sister recover at home. She has been on a meal plan since January 1st and has been eating beyond it on most days. The problem is, she has severe diarrhea ever since she started eating- she goes to the bathroom probably around X times a day, if not more. I’ve considered laxative abuse but i don’t think that’s the case. What should I do? Is this normal? Is it advisable to prevent her from earing what she wants, as not to upset her stomach? How do I belp stop it? How do I know when she is in danger? I feel like if we go to a doctor they will put her on a very strict diet like if she hd the stomach flu, and I think that would pull her back into restricting. This is a lot of questions but I hope someone has some advice!

43,Getwell2019,12/14/2018,My 12-year-old daughter is on a journey of recovery,"It will take a lot of baby steps, I truly get it. Especially in the beginning, it will be slow. I tell myself, be patient, beginning is always hard. The breakthrough will come eventually.At least she has opened up herself to me and expressed that she wants to seek professional help. We got a friend and pastor’s wife involved and she is a beautiful and kind fitness instructor. I am taking my girl to do workout sessions with her, and one premise is that she must eat, or “no eating, no workout”. She used to push herself do excessive workouts and skip meals. My friend and fitness instructor told her to do limited workouts and eat a certain amount and has kindly created her a simple menu framework to follow. She is not following it for sure, I am fully aware, as she intentionally hides herself in washroom at breakfast or dinner times. At least she has stopped doing excessive workout now!!! All those baby steps count...I took her out intentionally tonight and our family watched “Green Book” movie. Eating disorder also makes young girls depressed easily. Being pregnant for 7 months and working full-time, I desperately want my girl recover 100% from anorexia, though feeling tired from carrying a heavy belly around. My hubby totally did not get it, and saw eating disorder as a result of my spoiling our daughter. I yelled and screamed at him, “ stop trying to be one if you cannot make it a good doctor; just be a helper on the side if you do not know how to be a good parent, stopping making the problem worse. Enough on my body already!” Later on I showed him a YouTube video on eating disorder story, he started getting it! I also approached our family doctor and we have to wait until early Jan. There is an eating disorder program run by a local hospital, doing family-based treatments for my daughter’s age. And it does need referral from our family doctor. I am constantly tired and still on medications for morning sickness and heartburn. Plan to work until end of Jan to get top-up allowance during maternity leave. We have to consider the financial reality. I wish I could be off work now to focus on helping my daughter with her eating disorder issue. At the same time, I am sometimes unhappy with her, thinking that she is so self-Centered on her body issue and forgets that her not-so-young mother has to go through pregnancy discomfort all the time!

Thank you for sharing your story.  I am so sorry your young daughter is struggling with an eating disorder but glad to hear she wants help and she came to you.  That is really going to help in the difficult days ahead.  I am sure you just want to put your feet up and rest with all that is going on.  Soon the new baby will be here and you will be getting help for yourself and your daughter.  It is such a good thing she is young and wants help.  That should be of great help.  Not easy.  Just the thought processes and behaviors aren't ingrained for years and the process although difficult won't be as difficult to turn around.  I don't want to make it sound like she isn't sick and doesn't need help.   Not at all.  And I am glad you are there for her.  I am in recovery after thirty plus years of suffering.  The family based treatment wasn't around in the 80's and I don't know if I would have been able to go it.  I have been in recovery from the anorexia for around three years I think, and the overeating and binging for six months as well as self harm for six months.  I also suffered from major depressive disorder and anxiety.  A lot of individuals do who also suffer with an eating disorder. The depression is a lot better as is the anxiety but there are still days it can be difficult.  But the eating is great.One thing I am always careful not to do is give the eating disorder an identity.  I say, ""the"" or ""an""  or ""it"", to take power and ownership away from it.   It doesn't own us.  It may want to but it doesn't.  We may suffer from an eating disorder but to say my or my daughter's, etc. to me gives it an identity and power.  My identity is in who Christ says I am.  I am His child.  I am set free.  I belong to Him.  The only one who has that kind of power in my life is Jesus.  So I have learned over the years to treat the eating disorder as an entity outside of myself.  I truly  believe this helped in my recovery.  So just something to think about. I am glad you posted.  Sorry it took a while to get to your post.  Please keep us posted and let us know how you all are doing and how the baby is.     Take care.  I know you are worried.  I saw what I put my parent's through. Do what you have to do, but don't worry.  It won't change anything except make you sick.

44,greg9840,11/30/2018,My daughter disagrees about BMI,"Hello everyone,
My 13 year old daughter was recently diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.  She grew over 4 inches fairly recently (she is now 5' 4 1/2"") and simultaneously slimmed down, so my wife and I though she had slimmed down due to rapid growth, so we didn't realize there was a problem with anorexia for several months.  She later admitted she was going days at a time without eating or restricting to only X calories per day at times.  She has been unable to complete her school work due to lack of focus, which has never happened before, so we had her placed on medical school leave.  When we took her to the doctor, he checked her urine and she was dehydrated. I guess we caught this relatively early - her BMI was borderline of healthy weight when at the doctor. We took our daughter to a doctor who specializes in eating disorders, and she said our daughter needs to gain more weight to repair her brain and organs.  My daughter disagrees, saying that a BMI of X is a ""healthy"" weight, so as long as she is at least at X, she is fine.  We have a meeting with a nutritionist next week to discuss BMI in detail, but I was wondering if there is anything we should be telling our daughter in the mean time.  She insists she only has to eat X calories per day with moderate exercise (based on online calorie calculators) to maintain her X BMI.  What is normally recommended for calories at this point, and what are parents supposed to tell recovering children who argue that X BMI is healthy?

45,[email protected],11/19/2018,Thoughts?,"Hello everyone, I have been lurking around here for a month or so and feel blessed to have so much information in one place.  My daughter is currently in an in-patient treatment facility and is recovering.  What I have learned about ED's has left me trying to obtain more information, I feel bad that I didn't know anything about them in the first place.  How could ED's be what they are and I just had no clue?  I actually feel ashamed to some degree.When I started this journey as a parent I was terrified, and to be quite frank I still am.  I started a journal before she was admitted and I have found it to be a good way for me to vent, or to cope with what is happening.  Writing things out seems to help me.  I was thinking about starting a blog, my intent is to bring awareness to the disease and also share my story as a dad.  I couldn't find the specific answers I was looking for in the beginning of this journey.  I couldn't find any on the facility or anything in general about what the first day would be, or what the 21st day would be.  Maybe by sharing my journal I could help another dad like me that felt like he couldn't breathe when this all started.  I spoke to my daughter about this and she says she is ok with it.  I will not be using her name, but she says everyone knows anyway.  She seems to like what I am trying to do, or at least she says she does.  Before the Monster came we were very close, we still are, but I found out some things that had been happening with her ED that makes me wonder if she is being truthful all the time like she use to be.I guess my reason for the post is what do you think?  I feel something pulling me towards doing it but I don't want to be harmful either.   I look forward to your thoughts.  Thanks in advance.",iwanttolive,"Wed,11/21/2018-9:15pm",None,"Hello.  Me again, iwanttolive.  I think it sounds like a good idea, just want you to be careful and protect yourself as you do this if you decide to go for it.  I would also post this on the other subjects under working towards recovery, or maintaining recovery to see what others think as well.  I know I post a lot about my journey and share my thoughts and struggles and victories.  I think it helps people to be able to relate to me as a person not just someone who has had or has an eating disorder.  I try to not come across as I have all the answers, not saying that you are doing this.  I want to be relatable.  Sharing the good with the not so good.  People who have been posting for a while are able to see the changes that have taken place since I started posting.  So for you as a father who wants to connect to other fathers or mothers of your experience, I see no harm in that.  I find it interesting that the hospital where your daughter is in hasn't given you an idea of what is going on with her treatment, of what to expect.  Most places will tell people the types of groups, expected time of treatment, which I know varies a lot depending on the individual, but there is usually some idea.  Family therapy is usually always a component of treatment.  Knowing if they practice intuitive eating, the type of therapeutic approach that is used, CBT, DBT, a combination;  if they have trips outside of the hospital, things like that.  If patients are allowed in their rooms during the day, etc. I admire your commitment not only to your daughter but to helping others.  As I said before though, right now, you need to focus on you and your daughter and your family.  The other stuff will come.  I hope you have a nice Thanksgiving.  It will be different.

I think what happened to us happened very fast, and in that week or two leading up to her admit into the treatment facility I was so scared, and I couldn't find what I was looking for.  Maybe it was that I couldn't find the exact positive response I wanted to hear.  Part of that is every patient is different and the other part is there is no way to give anything definite on any eating disorder, of course you already know this.Since my daughter has been in the treatment center, tomorrow starts Day 24 for her, I have nothing but positive things to say about the place.  I think so much of the place I wish I could sing their praises here but I understand that is not allowed.  Everything you spoke of in your above post has absolutely been discussed and we are briefed regularly.  The facility runs like a well oiled machine and I am so happy places like this exist.  Things now are much better than what they were a month or so ago, it was just so scary in the beginning.  Everything you spoke about is covered, my post was a little misleading I see after I went back and read it, sorry.You are correct, right now it is about my daughter.  I have just returned to work and that's where I am tonight.  When I get off in the morning we will head back down to see my daughter, we have Thur-Sun this week because of the holiday.  She is doing well in the program and I am so thankful for that.  I hope you to have a wonderful Thanksgiving.  Talk to you soon.  Oh yeah, thanks for giving me a response on my post, I really appreciate it.",iwanttolive,"Wed,11/21/2018-11:25pm",None,"I am so glad you like the place your daughter is in.  No worries over the misunderstanding.  I had some really BAD experiences.  So I am so happy to hear your daughter is doing better and you like the facility.  Hopefully this will be the only time she needs inpatient, but just know she may need a higher level of care in the future.  Coming out of inpatient is difficult as the 24/7 isn't there.   Will she go into an outpatient program or is that too far in the future?  For me, it took a very long time to surrender the eating disorder to God.  I don't know why.  I just was too afraid to live.  My username, iwanttolive, is because for most of my life I did not want to.  I wanted to die so badly.  I almost did on numerous occasions but God had and has other plans and I am so thankful for my recovery and life.  Tonight at church I thanked God publicly for helping me overcome the eating disorder and self harm.  I spent so much of my life sick that now at 51 I am learning how to live as an adult.  My life was gone for so long being so sick.  I am now doing well and am preparing to help others even outside of this forum.  I am just waiting on God to direct me and I have some ideas.  I can only imagine how scared and unprepared you were finding out about your daughter's condition.  My parent's are nurses so they knew more than most what was happening but they couldn't stop me from doing what I was doing until they threw my butt into a hospital.  They got me onto Medicare at age 16 and I am still on it.  They knew the potential for long term help.  Your daughter seems motivated so I pray she will not have to go through what I did.  They know how to treat the illness better than they did when I was first sick.  I think that was a big part of why it took me so long to get well, poor help in the beginning in the early 80's.  Anyways, it is getting very late, again, for me so I have to go.  Any help I can provide I would like to be available.  So I don't want to overwhelm you but just post and I will see if I can help.

We had some passes and we were able to leave the facility for the first time together since she was admitted.  She is doing very good, but as you can understand the urges are very strong in her mind that food is just bad.  She feels guilty every time she eats and just beats herself up.

I am glad you got to spend time with your daughter for Thanksgiving.  That was good for her.  To get out and not be in the treatment facility all day on a holiday.  That is difficult.  I know it is still very difficult for her and that she is still afraid of food.  That will take time and healing and trust that eating isn't going to make her gain a ton of weight.  It takes trust in what she is being taught and learning through experience as she is on the meal plan.  Once she reaches her goal weight if she hasn't yet, she will come to learn that she can eat and not gain. But this comes with practice and trust.  Time.  Lots of time.My parents are coming back tomorrow. They have been in California for two weeks.  I really miss them. But I have enjoyed peace and quiet with the two dogs and myself at their house.  I wish I could live on my own but I can not afford it.  I am glad you posted again.  Take care.  And remember, recovery takes time.  Be patient with yourselves and with your daughter.  Get help for yourselves and if you don't yet, see about getting involved in a Bible based church where you can find support from other Christian's.

I am sorry to hear about your daughter but it is good that she came to you and let you know.  My best suggestion is to ask her what she needs and how best you can help her.   Let her know you are there to talk with her if she needs to.  Let her know you are there for her and are thankful that she is trusting you.  Open dialogue is really good.   I wouldn't try to force her to eat or monitor her food as she will be getting help soon.  It may cause her to pull away.  It is a good sign that she is trusting you right now.  Research the hospitals you are looking into.  Ask questions about how long meal times are, if they practice intuitive eating, if the patient knows what they will be eating and be filling out their own meal plan or is their food placed before them without them knowing what is being served.  Are they allowed in their rooms during the day.  Some of these types of questions so your daughter knows what to expect.  What model of therapy will be used.

47,rea_rea,08/20/2018,Advice for talking to my family?,"Hi! I hope you don't mind me coming to this forum as I'm not actually a parent, I'm the child (24 yr old child). I need to talk to my family, but need some advice so I was hoping y'all could help give me some perspective. My ED started about 7 years ago, but I've been in recovery for almost two years with a few rough patches here and there. It started towards the end of high school and I did everything I could to hide it from my parents-I think they suspected something, but we just don't communicate in our family so nothing was said to me. I left for college and that's where my friends took over. When I had breakdowns or had to go to the hospital or anything they were there for me. I hate that I lied to my parents about so much - making up reasons why I was in the hospital and stuff, but I didn't want them to know because I was ashamed. Now that I truly feel I'm doing better I have to get this burden off my chest and tell them, but I'm still scared. Do you, as parents, have any advice for me? I'm going to try to talk to my older sister first because she's actually a therapist so maybe she can give me some advice on how to handle them as well, especially knowing their personalities. She was away at school during these years though so I imagine she'll be a bit surprised. One other thing is she and I live a few hours away so I don't know how to meet with her because I really want to do it somewhere private, not at a restaurant or anything. Any suggestions there? I just really want this secret out so I can feel free and also so maybe they'll understand me better and why I hate diet talk and stuff ya know?

48,jeune,10/27/2018,Only the Stepmom. Step-daughter in her 30s Grievously Ill,"Hi, Friends,
I've only been my step-daughter's step-mom for a few years. She's become VERY ill over the last year.  Her teeth are so gray that when we saw her last week after not being with her for maybe 6 months from a distance I thought she'd gotten braces.Her diagnosis is cirrhosis due to alcoholism but her dear mom, for some reason, will not consider that she also is bulimic.  What can I as a step-mom to do?  I've been 12 Stepping for a lot of years and have seen so many lives miraculously changed that, though I think her mom and sister have lost hope, I refuse to.  There's no money for treatment, however.  I'm doing all I can to gather info for her sister to present to their mom but am VERY concerned that her disease has progressed this far.  I understand that Adult Protective Services can force someone into evaluation. Does anybody have any advice?Thanks so much!",BobJ48,"Mon,10/29/2018-9:19pm",Jeune.,"Situations like these are difficult alright.  One would like to think that professionals in the medical and psychology fields have come up with effective ways to deal with things like this, but as far as I know, they haven't. In the long run,  it's pretty much up to the effected individuals to make the proper decisions themselves. At the same time, I'm willing to bet that both of them know there's a problem.  But you are right, what does it take for them to admit to it, as well as gaining some bits of hope that they can actually do something about it.  Because really, some people believe that they are in so deep that there really isn't anything they can do. As you know from your own 12 step experiences, folks need to admit to their problems first, and then they need to believe that there are things they can do.  The ""not giving up hope"" part, you know ?   I'd not be surprised if they both were dealing with depression as well, which is another thing that can sap people's hope. Do you think there is anyone positive  that the daughter feels safe talking with ?   That would seem to be a first step in this.  Anyone who she feels she can talk honestly with, and who she feels won't judge her poorly ?Even with a connection like that, it can still be hard for the person to believe that there's hope, if their mind won't allow them to feel any. But yes : Being all alone with this, as she may believe that she is, is not a good situation at all.  At some point she'll need to take some chances for herself, which is one theme that she might be able to identify with, but  that can be difficult too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,Sealfearn,08/01/2018,My 11yr old DD constantly body checking and self loathing,"Our DD was diagnosed with Anorexia in April having very quickly lost a lot of weight and becoming obsessed with exercise.
We were referred to local child mental health support service and thankfully she has restored her weight but what she is now suffering mentally by her still being completely tormented by the anorexic voice in her head that is telling her she is fat and she is obsessed with body checking in any mirror or reflective surface (shop windows, cars etc)
We have talked about this in therapy and hid the mirrors in our house.
We are now on our summer holiday and I think we have made a stupid mistake as we have chosen a poolside and beach holiday which means she is having to wear a swim suit and sienna the first few hours of the day crippling herself and burying herself because she knows she wants to jump in the pool with her sibling but the anorexia and anxiety won’t let her.
I am trying my best to say encouraging and supportive things and sit patiently with her.  Sometimes just holding her until she finds she can do it.

The earlier the patterns of behavior are stopped, the easier it is to break them.

50,Dsgusted,09/25/2018,I don't get it,"I have read so much on the internet looking for helpful advice. I have a teen daughter who has been restricting her food.  She is underweight. This all is new over the summer. And really just in the last two months.  No real traumas.  I feel like it started when she got mad that I didn't let her switch schools. She realized she was letting her food attitude get out of hand but chose to continue because it wasn't bad enough yet. Whatever that means. Then she asked for help.   I have set up a meeting with a nutritionist and have been there twice. And once to a therapist.  And they very quietly encourage her to eat more. Why is no one calling her out on it? Giving her scary facts? Why would you tell her your not at anorexic level yett? Why is no one giving me info on how to implement a meal plan? Why is everyone waiting until she is in a danger zone?  I am frustrated and disgusted.  This is selfish. A pride issue.  And I am irritated by the coddling and lack of action.  I can calmly sit and wait on her to eat a set diet...but  I need someone outside of the family to give me the rules. What is reasonable- What to serve. Then I would be able to simply say doctors orders- just do it.  If I implement without that it will become an emotional battle of wills.  I look at her and am scared for her, but I really just see stubborn pride and defiance.  Is there a meal plan online somewhere?  Some guidance for action to take to restore some of herb weight?  I don't mind continuing therapy. But I am frustrated at how slow the process is to get going while the weight drops so quickly.",iwanttolive,"Wed,09/26/2018-8:15pm",Dsgusted,"Hi.  I am so sorry you are  having to deal with this.  It is frustrating, but I don't think it is simple.  And not necessarily a pride thing or being stubborn just to cause you grief.  Being that I don't know all the details, what I do know is that when I was anorexic, I was terrified of food and of gaining any amount of weight.  Being in control was the number one thing in my mind. Controlling what I ate and how much and watching the numbers go down on the scale was intoxicating.  I am glad you are in therapy.  Could you ask the dietician to recommend a meal plan so she doesn't slip further down and start having health complications.  Can her therapist tell her what will happen if she continues to lose weight?  I know you are scared, maybe angry, worried.  These are all normal reactions to watching your daughter suffer and you feeling like you are not able to help her.  It is positive that she is talking with a therapist.  That is such a good sign.  It would be good if you got help for yourself as well.  I don't know why no one has told her of what could happen.  She needs to hear it.  But scare tactics don't work all that well.  But knowing that this illness is addictive and very serious may help her understand some and cause her to want to accept the help being offered.

i don't know if i am ready to admit to what has been going on. if i do, i don't know to what extent i should share.should i tell her that it's been seven years? should i tell her i have engaged in behaviors for weeks on end, that i have found thousands of ways to hide what is going on, that i have no intention to recover because it's simply an impossible task at this point?i don't want to hurt her. that is the bottom line. i know the way i was raised has fueled my eating disorder and i do not want her to feel at blame. i desperately do not want her to feel sorry for me, either. this would be the first time i have ever, ever told anyone about my issue. as a parent, what would you want to know from your child? would it hurt you to know the details, or would the honesty be a comfort to you? the facts are that i know i can do it by myself as long as someone like her who is around me basically all day every day has the knowledge of what is going on. i have semi-recovered by myself before... it could potentially be longer term as long as i do not feel trapped by her trying to help me. but i know what that sounds like - like i just want space to get worse, or something. how do i communicate this without it sounding like my eating disorder is talking, trying to survive?",BobJ48,"Mon,09/17/2018-4:49pm",Jnil,"One thing that might help is if your mother was able to understand that what you are going though is pretty much the same as what other people with EDs go though.   That the situation you find yourself in, and the things you've gone though in the past, are not necessarily the result of some set of uniquely terrible things that she's done, but are pretty much what a lot of other people go through as well. You wrote :  ""i have semi-recovered by myself before... it could potentially be longer term as long as i do not feel trapped by her trying to help me. ""Yes, I know what you mean about that.  How the feeling that she's hanging over your shoulder, and examining your every move, might make things worse rather than better.  But at the same time, it's unreasonable to expect that she's not going to want to help.So what you may want to do is come up with some specifics as to how she might help. I suspect you know that ""Just leave me alone"" is unlikely to feel satisfactory to her, so try and think of some specific things that she actually could do to help you.  Concrete things that actually would feel helpful I mean, rather than feeling intrusive.   Helping with meal plans, maybe helping you get some therapy, having her read some things that would give her a more intimate idea of what you're going though. What I mean is, it's likely that she'll want to do something, so you'll want to be ready to offer her some actual things that she can do.  If you follow what I'm getting at ?I know that you might not be able to think of anything right off the bat, because when a person's been concerned with hiding things for all those years, it really can take some new kinds of thinking, when it comes to the idea of parents knowing and being able to actually help. So you may have to put your mind to it, when it comes to figuring out ways she can help, that actually would feel helpful.See what you can come up with ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are very helpful and have helped me a lot over the years.  I am now doing very well but it took a long time.  It makes it doubly difficult because your daughter is refusing help.  My parent's told me if I lost more weight they would put me in the hospital.  I didn't believe them and didn't believe I was that sick.  But they did follow through  with their threat.  I lost more weight and they had me hospitalized against my will to save my life.  This happened until I was able to realize I wanted to get better and now I am doing well and am in therapy still working through what caused the eating disorder and self harming behaviors.  It is so painful and I feel so much for you.  I am glad you reached out for support.  If you think her situation is life threatening, I would not hesitate to get her into a program.  She may hate you and curse at you but more than likely it will be the eating disorder voice speaking and not your real daughter.  As I said, she is probably very scared.  Lonely.  Doesn't understand what to do and how to reach out for help.  I don't know but depression may be playing a role here too.  I didn't realize how mean I was to my parent's until they told me recently. I am now fifty.  Not everyone suffers for as long as I have.  I was resistant to change mostly our of fear.  The sooner she gets help the better the chances of her recovering are.  I will pray for you and your daughter.  And your family.  I know how painful this is and wish I could give you a hug.  So I send a virtual hug through my words.  Keep in touch and post for support.

55,Flipflop75,08/05/2018,Not sure?,"I have a 17 yr old daughter who is losing weight without explanation. First, let me just say that we do have a doctors appointment in a couple weeks to get a full physical and blood work done to check for medical reasons. Mentally she’s great. We are extremely close and she tells me everything (sometimes too much, haha). She has never had body image issues any more than what I would consider “normal”...no red flags ever is what I mean. She has always had an athletic build, she’s never been thin until now. I know I can’t post weights here right? To give you an idea of what she’s lost. I don’t know anything about eating disorders which is why I’m here. Can you have an eating disorder without being aware of it? She tells me she’s just not hungry and will not eat as much during the day. Not on purpose, but because she’s just not hungry.

Often EDs have to do with control issues, which can seem different to the person than food sorts of things.  Not eating…that would seem to have to do with food of course, but often it's the self-control aspect which seems most important to them.  Which…doesn't everyone need to be self-dissplined ?  So it can all seem pretty normal to them to begin with. The test would be to see what sort of anxiety she'd find herself feeling, if somehow she noticed that she happened to be gaining,  instead of losing like she's been doing up 'till now.If she found herself feeling really anxious, or feeling anxious simply at the thought of gaining, that would be something to pay attention to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

57,riverma,07/25/2018,"supporting angry, hospitalized teen","Hi,
This will be my 16 year old son's third night in the hospital for an ED and he is getting an ng tube. He's very angry and upset about this and in complete denial that he has an ED. How do you support a child who's getting treatment against his will? I was told it's probably best if I'm not there to see the tube get put in (against his will) and when I go to the hospital he argues with me, pleading to get him out, and talks in circles. We're new to this. He's had an ED about 3 months. thank you",iwanttolive,"Thu,07/26/2018-2:44pm",riverma,"Hello.  I am so sorry that your son is so ill.  And in denial.  Most of us are initially.  When I was 16 my nurse parents threatened me with the hospital if I lost more weight.  I didn't believe them and in I went.  This happened time and time again, even as an adult.  The fact that your son is angry is normal.  He is being force fed, he is terrified.  The people usually lashed out at the most are parents and loved ones.  The ""safety"" your son has felt from the anorexia is being taken from him against his will.  He will be angry.  And scared.  Remember that he is scared.  Having an ng tube is very frightening.  He will need your support and if he yells and fights you, deep down he is just a little kid and he needs you.  I know how difficult this is as now that I am older and in recovery after decades of fighting this ugly illness, my parent's and I have discussed how I treated them, and I was shocked.  I was also shocked at how ill they said I was and the programs I was in.  I find it difficult to believe even today, that I was that close to death.  So I encourage you that your son is really scared.  He is away from his surroundings, dealing with being forced to eat, gaining weight which is terrifying.  He most likely is unaware of all the hurt he is causing you.  You would do well to get some help for yourself as you go through this.  It may take a long time for him to recover.  You got it early and that is good.  I cried every day for a year when I was in the hospital and begged my parents every time I talked to them, daily, to get me out of that place.  They stuck to their belief that I had to be there.  It was agonizing for all involved.  I see what I did to my parent's but it was not on purpose.  It was fear, terror, anger, and torment of what I was going through.  Your son can get better.  Eating disorders are serious but recovery is possible as many can attest to that.  Hang on to Hope.  If you believe in God, cling to Him as you will need to during this time.  Try not to take his anger personally.  He doesn't know how to process all that is happening and you are an easy target.  You do need to take care of yourself, but know deep down, he doesn't hate you.  You are doing the right thing in getting him help.  I can tell you love him.  The pain on both sides is real.  Just be there for him.  Let him know you love him.  I would also let him know you are not his punching bag and he needs to be respectful when he talks to you, but allow him to cry and if he has to beg you to take him home, keep repeating that when he is well enough you will gladly take him home.  You will not abandon him.  Let him know you are there for him.  It is so difficult.  I am glad you posted and I will pray for your situation.  How was today?  Keep posting for support.  I am really glad you reached out here.  I hope to see you again.  Hang in there, as I know it is not easy.  Don't lose hope.  Hang onto it with everything in you.  My best wishes for you.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am sad to hear of your daughters condition and the pain you are in.

But I do check in once in a while down here for the parents as I am a daughter who put my parents through a lot.  Having the alcoholism mixed with the ED has got to be difficult.  Usually it is when the sufferer, your daughter, really realizes she needs help and wants it that recovery can begin.  Until she wants it for herself, all you can do is be there for her.  Listen and let her know you care.  Boundaries are at times necessary to preserve the relationship and keep you sane.  It may seem harsh but you must take care of yourself in order to be able to help your daughter.  I hope you are able to find a treatment center with the help of NEDA that will take your daughter and she will get the help she needs and that she will start to want the help.  That is so important.

60,rockit,02/02/2018,19 year old daughter refuses treatment but seems OK. What to do?,"I'm sure I'm not the first one to deal with such a situation and hope one of you can help.
My 19 year old daughter is in a pre-college program and the teachers there discovered that she discussed ED behaviors with another student. After a short conversation it became clear that this has been going on for about 3 years, on and off. Most likely had to do with different stressors that we experienced in the family around that time. It also validated a concern we already had, though not recently.
The teachers demanded that she went to therapy in order to stay in the program, and she did for a few times. However, she basically told the therapist repeatedly ""I am fine and decided to stop"", so clearly the therapy is not going to be effective.
From what we can observe she is indeed eating in a more healthy way, seems much happier, has better social life, etc. Also, in a recent routine dental screening no special issues were fond.
She is reluctant to speak with us and says that ""everything is fine"".
Realizing that ED recovery is a process, we understand that she may be putting on a show to make it appear externally as if everything is fine, but she does seem happy.
Not sure whether to confront her, let it go, or perhaps would be good to know what signs to look for.
Any help is appreciated. Thank you!",claire_bear,"Mon,02/05/2018-6:41pm",Hi rockit,"Hi rockit, I'm sorry to hear about the situation with your daughter.

61,8MosIn,03/12/2018,"Residential Program, Insurance Denial","My 15 year old daughter was on the cusp of an eating disorder in the summer of 2017. She was obsessing about calories and moving toward restriction. She began therapy soon after with an adolescent psychologist who diagnosed her with clinical anxiety and issues with self-esteem and self-perception. It felt as though everything was fine one minute and then everything we knew fell apart.She struggled through the fall with restricting. We visited a center in hopes of meeting with a dietitian. Our family was very new to EDs and I personally knew very little about them. The center we went to did more harm than good as it used a heavy-handed scare tactic. It was very upsetting to her and I. She was two months into calorie restricting and the consistent words used in the first (and only) meeting were ""hospitalization"" and ""death"". It was awful.Her therapist and I continued to research ED providers and practices. We weren't coming up with much. After Christmas, my daughter segued from calorie restriction to other eating disorder behaviors. We tried an IOP, but it was causing her more stress and making her feel hopeless, depressed and the brain fog that was settling over her made it impossible for her to go to school (she's a straight-A student and her grades have always mattered to her). She was beginning to entertain thoughts of self-harm. Each day was getting scarier than the one before. I had done some research and found a residential program a couple hours away that I felt would be appropriate. We had a serious talk about it.One week later she reached out to me and said she needed inpatient, that the IOP was not going to work and she needed to be saved from herself. Two days later we were taking a tour of the facility and she was getting her clinical assessment done. Five days later she was admitted.I have insurance; outside of my co-pay they've covered her therapist appointments. They would not cover the dietitian charges from the IOP.On her third day in the residential program, I was contacted that my insurance denied coverage. Despite having the information as to what my benefits will cover, my insurance company apparently contracts out to a third party whose ""MD, Board Certified Psychiatrist, who had no previous involvement in the case"" decided my daughter was medically stable, not at a dangerously low body weight, was motivated to address issues and was not psychotic.Luckily I was able to qualify for a personal loan (with my mom as a co-signer) to keep my daughter where she is. My daughter knows nothing about this as I want her focused on the residential program and not to be upset at all. It's 7 days in and she's doing very well so far.I have to get my daughter's authorization (they can release information to my daughter but not me, the parent and policy holder) to this third party just so I can receive copies of the specific documentation as to why her claim was denied. I was told she did not meet their medical necessity criteria. I read the criteria, she seemed to meet many of the points as the document reads. (But who am I, I'm only a worried, scared parent who was watching my daughter self-destruct before my eyes...but she only talked about self-harm and vitals are good, so I guess I'm wrong).Apologies for sounding bitter, but I feel violated on behalf of my daughter. Nowhere in my coverage is there an asterisk that states ""a third party will be consulted and decide whether or not your daughter receives insurance benefits"". And they had the gall to assign her a case worker who called me to suggest different resources and providers closer to home that were considered more appropriate for the level of care she needs (therapy and IOP).Now I have a battle to wage that I will have to make her aware of at some point, as the insurance company and the 'third party' have stripped my rights away as a parent. While I work full-time (I'm a single mom) and take care of my mom who is a senior citizen. Not to mention still be a fully functioning mom to my other daughter.Has anyone else gone through this frustration with an insurance company denying benefits? And how to fight back at the injustice?It's not about money anymore, it's about a broken system. And I want other parents aware of the pitfalls and not blindsided like I was.I'm very upset that there are so few appropriate resources specifically geared toward EDs and when a family does find a beacon of hope, a non-involved party paid by an insurance company can dash those hopes if a parent doesn't have alternate means to pay for treatment.Despite all of this, the most important thing is she's somewhere safe that practices a sound methodology toward treatment. I couldn't save her, but hopefully over the next two months she'll be getting a lot of tools, resources and therapy to get a better grasp on saving herself. And that I'm unbelievably thankful for!",BobJ48,"Mon,03/12/2018-10:37pm",Fighting Insurance.,"8Mosin,I'm not a parent, but hopefully you will hear from some, as the insurance issue you mention is a common one.  You may want to contact NEDA as well, and see what suggestions they have.  There are some other forums on the web for parents , so you might want to check them out too.  ""Tribal knowledge"", you know ?  That's what you'll want to tap into. Also, as I understand, there actually are lawyers that will handle ED insurance-related issues like yours, and can often twist insurance's arm into paying.  As you have probably figured out by now, they are basically daring you to try and do something to materially refute their decision.  Heaven knows who this ""third party"" is, what their status is as an ""expert"" might be, and how much insurance pays them to deny people's claims.  My sense is that if they are under contract to the insurance company, it's possible that they aren't exactly a disinterested party.  And then there's the part about them not having even seen your daughter in person, which I imagine could cause their judgment to be viewed as suspect as well.  All meat for lawyers, you know ? In any case, it's true that  people often manage to get insurance to change their minds, so this decision may not be as set-in-stone as they would want you to believe, but you may have to bring in some big guns of your own, in order to help them see the light about this. In any case, I'd get in touch with the NEDA folks, and ask them what some strategies might  be.  I'd definately poke around on the web, and look into the lawyer situation as well, as there really are some who specialize in ED-related claims like yours.

Let me start by saying that I am a mother of a 15 year old daughter too so I understand how scary things can be when they develop maladaptive behaviors like using substances, cutting, suicidal thoughts or eating disorders to name a few.  Many teens experience low self esteem, peer pressure, bullying, trauma, addiction, depression, anxiety and do not know how to cope with such things.  An eating disorder may develop as a means to control the ""out of control"" emotions they are experiencing.  As a parent, I encourage you to keep talking to her.  Allow her to be open about the confusing time of adolescents and all that comes with it.  Allow her to discuss family dynamics and past experiences with you without judgment.  Allowing for open and honest communication free from shame and punishment can go a long way.  I am not saying you haven't tried this and more...
Additionally, I happen to work for an insurance company and deal with your frustration on the other side almost daily.  Insurance companies have medical necessity criteria that outline what someone has to exhibit to meet certain levels of care.  So, a Residential facility does an assessment and calls that clinical information in to the patient's insurance.  Clinicians take that information and match it up to the clinical criteria.  If a patient exhibits x,y,z then it warrants a certain level of care for treatment.  Clinicians ask questions to make the best decisions they can while considering many factors.  (How long has the issue been going on, what treatment has been tried, are there complicating factors, etc.)  If the clinical presentation does not meet medical necessity criteria then it is sent for an MD to review.  Insurance companies have internal MDs and consulting MDs(Third Party reviewers) to render these decisions.  They are all board certified and aware of the insurance company's criteria meeting certain levels of care (Inpatient, Residential, Partial Hospitalization, Intensive Outpatient). They are vetted and reputable companies that do these types of reviews.  If there is an insurance denial, please know that you have appeal rights.  Call the member number on the back of your insurance card and ask for an appeal or ask the facility to request one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Any suggestions please.",iwanttolive,"Wed,03/14/2018-10:31pm",applemom,"Hi and welcome to the forum.   I am a daughter, a sister, an aunt.  A friend.   When I was at my worst, I did not want to get better.  I was in denial as to how ill and close to death I was.  No matter what my parents told me or doctors or anyone.  I was fine.   FINE    It is difficult to deal with a supposed adult legally saying.   When I was eighteen I was really only a child.  I needed my parent's love and care no matter how much I yelled and rebelled.  I do not remember rebelling and yelling.  I only remember wanting to lose weight.  And I went through a bulimic state as well.  Almost died from both.  Denial.  No I was never that sick.   Now newly recovered I still don't remember being that ill.I say all that to say this.  There is Hope.  Don't give up on Hope.  Also, your daughter needs you no matter what she says or screams at you.   The eating disorder takes over a person and turns them into a different person, a person controlled by an eating disorder.  There is much fear with an eating disorder, for everyone involved but especially for the sufferer because sometimes we know what we are doing but can't help it.   Just love your daughter.  Let her know you are there for her.  Set boundaries since she is eighteen.  You can find help with that with the family therapy.  But she needs you.  I don't know what your relationship was like before the bulimia but even if it wasn't good, she needs you.  Love her, be there when she wants to talk, don't take her attacks personally.I know from watching what my parent's went through what having a daughter with an eating disorder is like.  Now that I am better they share more about what it was like.  They didn't hide that from me so much but I can hear it better now.  They don't tell me to shame me but to help me understand what it was really like since I seem to have selective memory.  I remember the horrors of it and all but not the disrespect to my parents whom I love dearly.   That still bothers me, that I treated them like that, but it was also the disease in progress.  And they knew that too.  SO I wish you the best and hope the best for you.  Please continue to post for support.  We are here for you.

Thanks so much for sharing your feelings. I have a 20 year old daughter that has had bulimia for over a year. She binges and purges after every meal. I wish I knew what she was feeling. I have always supported her and been there for her. As far as loving her, she (and her brother) are my world. This disease is ugly and really changes the relationship. Some days she will confide a little, but will quickly slam the door and angrily tell me that I am not her therapist. I have learned that this is how she manipulates me and holds onto the disease, but it doesn't make it any easier. She can be so mean and say the most cruel things. I know this is to drive me away when I get too close. Thank you for saying that you still wanted your parents even though you didn't show it.

I recently began seeing a therapist with a back round in eating disorders, she has given me the strength to set boundaries and still let her know how much I love her.

63,marjan2002,03/18/2018,Should I let her live on campus at college?,"My daughter was diagnosed with anorexia (she restricts) 15 months ago. She spend 2 x 2 months in an intensive outpatient program and went back to school end September. Since then sees an eating disorder therapist, and a dietitian that specializes in eating disorders every 2-3 weeks. She is a high school senior and wants to live on campus at a college 3 hours from home.
We worked very hard with her and was able to get to what is considered a “healthy weight.” Since late January she slowly has been loosing weight again. Each time there is a different excuse, I'm sure you're all familiar with them. She feels she is no longer sick, she believes her weight is fine for her, we are all making too much of a fuss etc etc etc.
My girl is a senior in High School and looking forward to going to college. I, with her recent weight loss again, am really uncomfortable with her going away to college. Apart from her eating disorder, she is also vegetarian which makes finding quality nutrition in college even more difficult. Also, I would only be able to bring her home to see her ""specialist team"" twice per month at max. I am really worried she might relapse.
My girl and I have now come to some sort of an ultimatum... She needs to reach a certain weight within the next 6 weeks and then maintain without me making a fuss for at least 1 month. If she is able to do this, she can try college away. If she can't, she will have to live at home and do community college for a year since it will be too late to enroll in a different, local university.
I am still very worried and so is her therapist. Am I doing the right thing? Is it too early in the recovery progress and will I most likely be bringing her home sick again half way through the semester? Or is it good to give her this power?
Has anyone been in my situation? Any suggestions, comments?",BobJ48,"Wed,03/21/2018-9:44pm",Off to school.,"Boy, it's hard to say.As you said, the fact that she seems unable to maintain her recovery weight is worrisome, particularly if she makes excuses rather than viewing it as an issue of concern.   The issue of her mindset, you know ?  What sort of mindset will she take with her when she heads off to school ?Balance that with the distress she is likely to feel if you don't let her go.  I imagine I don't have to tell you how people with EDs tend to respond to distress, and the concept of ""failure"", and others trying to take their sense of control from them. So it's a dodgy issue for sure.  Again, I suspect that her mindset will be an important factor, but if she doesn't seem to be worried herself about the fact that she's been loosing, then I can see where you might be worried. Have you been able to ask her what she thinks the consequences should be, if she goes but starts dropping weight once she's there ?  Allowing her to be part of the decision-making process might be one thing that helps her retain some sense of control.",ChooseRecovery,"Wed,03/21/2018-9:18am",I have a similar situation,"I have a remarkably similar situation with my daughter. Last September we allowed her to go away to college even though she was having trouble maintaining a healthy weight. She was there, she was down, she was there, she was down. We were nervous about her leaving because of all the added pressure of a new environment. She badly wanted to go. Finally we let her go but we wrote up a contract between us (her parents), her therapist, and her. It made stipulations about getting weighed at the school health center and seeing a therapist at school. It gave us the right to bring her home if she wasn't meeting her part of the bargain. The first semester she was lonely and depressed, but she worked hard to earn her right to stay at school. This semester has been better. She's found a couple friends. She's interested in her classes. For us, a lot came down to how motivated we thought our daughter was to get better. We had to rely on our instincts after several years of dealing with her ED. She seemed to want to get better, despite the challenges and setbacks. For her, going away gave her some feeling of empowerment over her ED, and she's beginning to discover that there might be more important things in life than her ED, healthier things, reasons to get better. We're not in the clear by a long shot, but she's nineteen now and has to own her recovery, while we play support roles. We're hoping for the best and I'm hoping for the best for you and your daughter. Let us know what you decide and what happens next. Best of luck.",jskoeni,"Thu,03/29/2018-10:35am",College,"I am not sure if this will help your situation but I was 19 when I went into a 6 month long inpatient treatment program. I was released 1 month before moving off to college. I had lived in a half way house for a month and had, at the time, planned on relapsing in college. My mom and I had some good, honest discussions and I decided to stay 1 semester at home, taking 2 classes. 9/11 happened a month after I started classes and it was a good thing I was at home. I did relapse twice when I finally went off to college but have survived - almost 17 years in recovery. At the time, I had no clue that I could, as a 19 year in high school, could have legal authority over what I did and did not do. I think having a honest, open discussion with your daughter, and giving out realistic options might be a good way to start the conversation. I did not go to the school I had planned on going and still did really well (a B.A. and two master's degrees). Sometimes, we have to change the our future plans to ensure that our recovery is stable. It took me years before I could put my recovery before all else.Have you tried contact NEDA? They have trained volunteers that can provide some insight and suggestions. Also, have you talked to the college? If she is currently underage, you might be able to talk to the health center and see what options are available to 1) help her be accountable to herself and her recovery, and 2) succeed in college, as an adult, and as survivor of an ED.

Welcome to the forum. It can be hard to have a child we are worried about and because they are adults we are limited in our child's care if that is what they choose.
There is a parents toolkit that can help you learn more about eating disorders. https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/parent-toolkit
Also there is a helpline that can help find doctors in your area. And also give you support.

She is coming home tomorrow after being in treatment for the past 2 months.   This is the 5th time she has gone to treatment.  I just found this site yesterday and I wish I knew about it over the past 8 years.   I have probably experienced every emotion one can when dealing with an ED.   In the beginning I was so confused then I became so frustrated and now I am hopeful.   Last week we spent at Family Week with our daughter and we were given tools that we have never received before.   I guess at this point I don’t have a question because I have no idea what to expect tomorrow.   I just was wondering if anyone can offer advice on how to stay patient and trust that she knows what to do and will be able to stay in recovery.   My goal is to help others navigate through this illness because we have been on our own for so long and it’s hard to know where to go or what to do.,claire_bear,"Mon,02/05/2018-6:26pm",Welcome to the NEDA Forums! ,"Hi 8longyrs, welcome to the NEDA forums!

Welcome. I know this sight has helped me a lot, To be able to talk to others who understand what it is like to have a loved one consumed by ED. I hope things are going well for you and your daughter on her first day home.
I was given great advice from my therapist that helped me. I repeat this to myself and it helps me remain patient with myself and my daughter. ""I did not cause it. I cannot control it. I cannot cure it, She can cope with it."" It helped me tremendously. I could support my daughter, but I could not make the ED go away, only she could. It took off a lot of worry and stress from me. It also helped her realize that this was something she could conquer.
Good luck. Please take care of yourself. It can be so stressful and overwhelming, as you know.

During Family week the therapist looked at me and said you need to let it go....you can not fix your daughter you can only support her.   It was time for me to move on and take care of myself.   I have put myself and my family on hold as we traveled through this journey.   I realized on that day that my whole day revolved around my daughter and every conversation I had with my friends was about my daughter.   I sent an email that night to my friends and told them that I would not be talking about my daughter with them anymore.   That I was exhausted and couldn’t do it anymore.

Has she been able to tell you what she's afraid of as well ?I suspect I don't have to tell you how things can go, once she gets out.

Since this has been going on for so long we haven’t had really good talks about what is the root problem.  The last two treatments she left at about 80% and then was thrown into the college environment.   This time she left at what we hope is 100% and she has withdrawn from this semester in hopes that she can practice what she learned.   It has now been 5 days and I have some doubts.

68,taras,01/24/2018,Should I be concerned?,"Hi all -My 14 year old daughter is a very normal weight.  However, she is becoming increasingly obsessed with her weight.  She has, for the past 6 months, increasingly limited what she will eat, and talks every day about feeling fat.  For example, this morning alone she has told me in three separate conversations, that she feels fat.My concern is that she's starting to see herself very differently from reality.  She has started showing me photos on Instagram of very thin women, clearly wanting to look like them (they are very obviously Photoshopped, but she won't believe this).What I want to know is how to talk to her, or what to listen for.  I don't think telling her ""You're normal"" or ""Your weight is perfect"", or even showing her objective proof that she's on the low end of a normal weight range is effective (and might shut down communication if she thinks I ""just don't get it"").  I have NO experience with this, and dread responding in a way that will make her start hiding how she feels.Does anyone have any thoughts/advice?Thanks in advance.",2Joy2love,"Thu,01/25/2018-1:42pm",taras,"Hi taras,
First off that she is talking to you is very good. That she is able to share those feelings and fears with you. You are already doing good things in your relationship with her because she can talk to you. It is okay to acknowledge that this is how she is feeling. To respond something like ""I can tell that you are worried about your weight."" Then ask her why she is so worried. Just let her talk. As she talks just try to listen and she and you may discover what is behind this. You might have these conversations a lot and that is okay.

70,JustChecking,01/20/2018,"Questions, Venting, And More Questions","I’m new to this forum which I found while searching for answers on internet. The situation is causing strain on my relationship with my spouse- I’m sure that’s common. Subject of the problem lives full time with natural mother and 2 half siblings, older. At this point I’m refusing to even listen to my spouse discuss anything regarding the child because it is so frustrating to me. I’m certain that’s not a good solution but I’m at my wits end.
The child is a lifelong picky eater whose Mother is overweight. One sibling has normal weight, the other sibling is also overweight. As a child siblings and parents offered less than healthy food. Processed food a mainstay along with fast food. A sweet drink the norm for a 3 year old. Child had problems with constipation that resulted in painful bowl movements. Nothing was done to address the issue.
Diet was limited to a few specific types of processed foods. Or some sweet drink. Again, I have some experience with a child refusing to eat anything but a specific food. Never made an issue of it, continued to offer other foods, and the fixation on one food passed. Mealtime consisted of child being the main focus with every one present literally BEGGING the child to eat! And the child refusing unless given the exact food, always a poor food choice. I’ve never seen anything like it in my life, nor has anyone else I’ve spoken to. I’m not talking about parents saying, “ if you eat your vegetables you can have dessert” type begging/bribery. No this took begging a child to eat to new levels. The child was the MAIN subject of meals. Constantly the child, asking is that enough, and eventually resorting to tears. I’m certain it was as stressful for the child also.
Grocery shopping and meal planning revolved around the child to an extreme, all within earshot of the child.
Mealtimes were a nightmare. Constantly the begging and whining. Enough to drive the sanest person crazy.
I’m no mental health expert, however in my non educated opinion this family trained this child that food was power. Food was attention getting. Food gave them control over everyone in the household.
The child had numerous cavities in first teeth and several extracted for that reason. The child did not brush his teeth, and was most likely not properly instructed . At 5 years of age needed assistance dressing and tying shoes, all due to lack of parental instructions.
As the child got older the behavior persisted. Pediatrician noted the child as , “failure to thrive”. Ensure drinks added to diet. That was the extent of it.
All of this was a far cry from the way I was raised, and the way I was striving to raise my own children. I raised my children without diets, nor was the term used in our household. We stressed healthy eating. I’m far from perfect and we ate our share of less than nutritional foods. I strived to avoid making any comments regarding food, consumption, weight, etc, because of the comments made to myself and siblings growing up that resulted in problems for at least 2 of my family members. Our philosophy was to eat healthy nutritious foods and keep active. Your body will take good care of you if you take good care of your body. Simplified yes, but for raising young children it needed to be simple.
My opinion, for what it was worth was to stop making this a big deal. Stop BEGGING & CAJOLING this child to take another bite. Stop making this child and what went into their mouth the central focus of everyone’s life, daily routine, and activities. My pediatrician told me eat,y on that I would never control what came out of their mouth or what went in. Very true.
But alas, nothing was done and the behavior became entrenched, the begging continued unabated and became even more dramatic.
Now the child is 20 and has become so constipated that their bowel has nearly ruptured twice. The begging to eat continues, the over focused grocery shopping to find food that they will eat, cooking catered to this person, and the refusal to eat has now reached the point of causing heart arrhythmia. Every one shops and cooks with the consumers in mind, but the efforts on behalf of this person have always been exaggerated and over emphasized.
Now my spouse has dropped everything and is rushing to see child in hospital. Normal response, right? Except they do not see each other very often, rarely text each other. Consider that at age 11 child drew pictures of his Father and Mother together as a family and spoke of them all ‘Snuggling together.” Inappropriate at age 11, (eight years into our relationship, 3 in marriage,) considering father never lived with their mother, and there was never any possibility of that happening, Yes, as children we might hope for that, but to draw it in several pictures and verbalize it, despite being told more than once not an option. In this person’s mind, at least subconsciously, they have learned when they don’t eat to point of hospitilization, dad drops everything and comes and sees him. And Mom is there too, one big happy family.
Yes this person has anxiety issues.
I know I sound uncaring, but I no longer care to hear about this child’s issues because NOTHING was ever done. And nor will it. The child was allowed to remain in the custody of the parent who obviously failed miserably to parent this child. On my spouse’s part it’s a one way conversation, always ending with, “I’ve got nothing more to say”, or “I’m not talking about it”. For me it’s frustrating because one, it makes me angry that no one took care of this child- the mother left the sibling, 4 years older, to do the parenting. A 7 year old raising a 3 year old. And two, to constantly hear the same phrases that have never resolved anything. Personally I don’t know what to do other than keep my mouth shut so as to avoid another argument. When I remarked that this person is going to need intensive therapy by an individual trained in eating disorders I was met with the same remarks I’ve heard numerous times. There is no discussing this with my spouse. Maybe the solution is for me to just sit there and listen, at which time I’m accused of not caring or disinterest. I know this is stressful for my spouse and yet here I am complaining.
To me it just seems like this person was neglected a long time ago, and despite the crisis of the moment nothing is going to change ,",BobJ48,"Fri,01/26/2018-3:11am",Enmeshment.,"Dear JustChecking,You wrote :  ""Stop making this child and what went into their mouth the central focus of everyone’s life, daily routine, and activities.""While things may have reached a point where the damage is done, and many different things may have contributed to this, I think you may have hit the nail on the head with this comment.One thing you might want to do is look up the term ""enmeshment"" and see if it seems to fit some of what you've observed.

71,rowingchick,01/07/2018,Stubborn 20 yr anorexic daughter refusing treatment,"My 20 yr old anorexic daughter came home from a semester abroad having lost significant weight. Nearly a year ago, when she weighed more than she does now, the counseling center at her college encouraged her to check herself in to a hospital or ED treatment center; she reacted by firing her therapist, psychiatrist, nutritionist and counselor. She claims she ""does not have an ED"" and her weight is ""only a few pounds below what it should be."" She no longer has a primary care doctor. At this point, all her friends are commenting and encouraging her to seek treatment.
The day after she came home she got diarrhea, which she assumed was the stomach flu (A friend was also sick, and I got sick too, so stomach flue seemed reasonable). Given her weight, we deemed the stomach flu to be serious, so her father drove her to Urgent Care, but she basically refused to be seen.
This morning, she flew across the US for an internship, and is now in an area where she has no friends or family, and still has severe diarrhea. Obviously, she should go to the ER, or Urgent Care or something.
I am hoping that her employer will require a doctor's note saying it is safe for her to work. I need to hope for something.
Given that I have spoken with a couple of her friends from high school (I don't know her college friends), is there anything else I can do? She is not talking to me, as she says that all I talk about is her weight. She is now a 5 hour flight away.
Thanks for any suggestions!",Carol1234,"Wed,01/10/2018-8:19pm",rowingchick,"Hey rowingchick,
How have things been since you posted? Has your daughter been able to make it in to see someone? I'm really wishing for the best for you and for her; I wish I had advice I could give, but I just want to let you know I'm here to listen! This sounds like a really tough situation, and scary too. I can tell you're doing everything you can, from talking to her friends to posting on here. Let us know how things are going, for both of you. She's so lucky to have a mom who will go the extra mile to persist even though her eating disorder is making it difficult to communicate with her. I hope you're able to take care of yourself in this tough time too!
-Carol1234",BobJ48,"Thu,01/11/2018-3:05am",Stubborn ,"Dear Rowing,Oh brother, I can certainly understand why you are worried.  The episode where she refused to be seen at Urgent Care, I can only imagine how non-encouraging that must have been.  Yikes !And you are right, now she's 5 hours away, and on her own.  Given her history for looking out for herself, I can understand how helpless you must feel.  But it's pretty much like you said : She is indeed on her own out there.But trust me when I say this : At some point she's going to realize what sort of impact this is having on her.  Perhaps for some reason it was easy to turn her back on the negative aspects of her ED when she was fighting against you and her other friends : After all, what the heck do any of you know about her struggles towards the victory that weight loss represents ?But now that she doesn't have the fight with outsiders to distract her, it's going to be harder and harder for her to ignore the sorts of problems that come with her ED.  At some point she's going to hit that point in her ED where she really starts hating what a cruel taskmaster it's become, and the physical and mental drag which it's shouldered her with. What's going to happen then, and how she's going to come to think about it all is hard to say. But I think you can be sure that she's not going to be happy about where she finds herself with all this.  I know it's hard to think about her going through this process, but it may be what needs to happen before she decides she needs help.So I hope you won't lose patience with her.  It would be great if somehow we could force the situation when those we care about are in this sort of trouble, but I think you've already seen how difficult that can be.  And the sort of resistance it can engender. But if you can manage to stay in touch with all of the warmth she'll allow, then you'll also be there when she asks for your help.",2Joy2love,"Mon,01/15/2018-10:46am",rowingchick,"Hi rowingchick,
I am so sorry to hear about your daughter. It is so devastating to see your child suffering.
It also makes it harder when your child is an adult, because it limits what you can do, if she does not want to seek help.
I like what BobJ48 said about staying in touch with her. I know you are very concerned about her health and rightly so. Yet, it might be that the best way to reach her now is to not talk about her health but to connect with her through things that she likes. The idea that I have is to send her a package that has wrapped gifts in it. A gift that she can open up for each day of the month. So for February which has 28 days in the month, you would send 28 wrapped gifts so she can open a gift each day.  You can send a letter along with the package that tells her how much you care about her and that explains how you have sent her a gift for each day of the month. I do this with one of my college children that is going through a very hard time. Each day she unwraps a gift from me and she says it helps her a lot. I would stay away from all food, since that may make her feel like you are sending it to her just because of her ED. If she likes baths send her bath salts, if she likes to draw send her a sketch pad, ect. I found that it not only helps my daughter, it also helps me. As I search for gifts that I know she will like and as I wrap each one. I think of her and I feel like I am showing my love and helping her at the same time. I have now been doing this for 6 months, a lot of the gifts can be little and sometimes it is a note or quote that she gets. It has been very good for both of us.
Please take care of yourself. It can be hard to do when you are so worried about your daughter. I lost myself for a year when my daughter was in a very rough part of her ED. There were days that I was surviving hour by hour and some days moment to moment. Keep doing things that bring you joy and peace.

72,lcooker,01/05/2018,Parent of ARFID Child,"Mine is a long story but I'll skip part to my present situation which is that I have one child in treatment for an unspecified eating disorder related to Type 1 diabetes.  He is doing well but during family therapy we discovered that another of our children was likely ARFID.  I was given reading material to take home on ARFID and I am convinced that the therapist is correct.  With one child already in treatment we decided to address some of the ARFID behaviors at home with the second child, who I will call Noah for this blog.  Noah is 13 and has ADHD.  Since he was a toddler has had extreme food restrictions which have gotten worse by age.  He is at the 3rd percentile for weight but declining and his doctor is concerned since he does not seem to be hitting puberty milestones as expected.  He does not have body image issues which is why we know it is not anorexia.  We described the ARFID diagnosis to him and had a discussion about what this could mean.  He wants to treat at home and expand his eating options and the amount of food on his own.  I agreed to try this with him while we got through treatment of his brother since having two kids in treatment was overwhelming.Now to my questions.  Question 1:  Noah does seem to be eating a wider variety of foods albeit in small portions.  I have seen him gag at times and then I tell him not to continue trying to consume the food.  I'm not sure what to do here.  Any advice is appreciated.  Question 2) He is an extremely slow eater (part of the condition) and can sit at the table for hours.  This is frustrating for the rest of the family as one adult is usually trapped at the table with him providing encouragement and monitoring so he doesn't throw out his food.  Should we continue to do this?I understand if the answer is to speak to a therapist and not try to grapple this at home but I wanted to see if we could take steps in the right direction before we bring him to an eating disorders clinic.",rowingchick,"Sun,01/07/2018-7:57pm",ARFID,"Noah sounds similar to my step-son.  Our son successfully completed a partial hospitalization program at 13 yrs and is totally fine now.  The kids were there 5 days per week, all day, while parents joined once a week.  I know the gag reflex and the extreme slow eater thing.
All the kids were given a choice of a few different meals.  Eat one of the meals or drink a drink (I can't recall the name, but it was designed specifically for this kind of thing) within a certain time frame, which I think was 20-30 mins.  It seemed like forever.
In any case, it worked.  They can choose- gag on the food or drink the supplement, eat within the time frame or drink the drink (which does not taste great.)  That was the choice.  Period.
Try giving Noah the same choice and if he doesn't follow it, put him in a program now.
I have a second child whom I waited with and I cannot express my regrets.  It is so much easier to deal with EDs earlier than later. In addition, the issues with each effect all family members.  They feed off each others EDs, even though they are different types of EDs.  Good luck!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
