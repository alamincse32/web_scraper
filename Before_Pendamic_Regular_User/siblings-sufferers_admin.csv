0,indigo123,02/21/2021,Worried about sister and her habits are triggering me ED thoughts,"So basically I am working on a better relationship with food but it's really hard when living at home with my sister. I have noticed she has become more aware of what she is eating, the amount, and avoiding certain types of food. She doesn't really eat that much anymore and has started exercising. This is making it really hard for me to recover and be in a peaceful state with food when I can see that she isn't quite. I also noticed on her laptop that she had been searching for weight loss advice. By no means do I think she should or needs to lose weight, she is on the smaller side anyways, is fit and healthy. She is quite defensive and if we try to ask her anything around the topic she shuts us down and walks off. Having said this, when she sees me making food and it doesn't look like a lot she shows concerns which is helpful for me, but also I don't think she takes that for herself. What shall I do?",_admin_moderator,"Mon,02/22/2021-12:53am",indigo123,"Dear indigo123, welcome to the forums.

1,Froggie8,01-08-21,I suspect my sister has an eating disorder. How involved should I get?,"I have an awesome little sister who is going to turn 17 in March. I am concerned that she has developed an eating disorder or is on the path to developing one.
  Recently, my family and I have noticed that she is not on a regular eating ""schedule."" She will skip meals, sleep through them, or just have a snack. None of her food choices are very healthy, even though my mom makes healthy dinner options for her. She instead opts fast food. At first, I just assumed her altered eating was a result of a ""quarantine"" blues type of thing, but her habits aren't changing.
  My eyes weren't truly open to the situation until today. I was with my sister and her boyfriend on a shopping trip. I told her that she was looking really skinny (which I realize now is not the way I should have brought up my concern) and I again expressed my worries about her skipping meals. She admitted to me for the first time that she has a fear of gaining weight. She assured me that she doesn't ""starve"" herself and she eats when she is hungry. I started reminding her how she needs to eat healthier in order for her body to function. She responded that she ""doesn't want to get fat,"" and so I reminded her that if she was concerned about that part, she could always stay active and exercise. She told me that she didn't have time to exercise. At that point in the conversation, I then asked her if she had an eating disorder. She didn't say yes, but she didn't say no. I don't think she is certain either way herself.
  I told her that she needs to talk to our mom about all of this. She said she ""might,"" but told me not to discuss it with my mom.
  My question is: how much or little involved should I be? And what does the involvement look like? Do I let my mom know of the conversation that I had with my sister today, even though my sister told me not to mention it? Or should I stay out of it, knowing that my sister may never independently seek help? Either way, I am going to research how to be supportive in situations like this. Right now, she's in a world of high school self-consciousness, fake social media body ""influencers,"" and a relationship in which her boyfriend is incredibly body-image conscious.
  This is my first experience with someone close to me having a challenge like this (that I know of), so any advice is appreciated. I know how serious this issue is, and I would hate to see my sister hurt. I'm just unsure if it's my place to discuss it with our mother or not.
  Thank you.
P.S.: Now that I look back on our conversation today, I realize that I may have addressed my concerns the wrong way. I will be educating myself on ways to be supportive so that I will be better prepared for future situations.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,01/08/2021-2:56pm","Dear Froggie8, it's great","Dear Froggie8, it's great that you would like to support your sister during this difficult time!

2,monkcarter,08/30/2020,What to do?,I didn’t see a forum for family members that weren’t siblings so I apologize but this is my cousin. She has been doing this for years while she was a minor and now that she just turned 18. Her mother refuses to admit that she has anorexia even though doctors and psychologists diagnosed her. Her father is too weak to stand up to his wife. Her mother got her out of the hospital twice within days because she refused to say her daughter has a problem. My cousin is no longer going to doctors appointments now that she is an adult. What can I do? She has never looked thinner. Her heart rate is in the low 30s. She is dying and I don’t know what I can do me and her brother have tried to talk to her and she completely shuts us out. Any help works I just need to do something.,_admin_moderator,"Sun,08/30/2020-10:24pm",Medical symptoms,"Hi monkcarter, thank you for posting.

4,Dunn1234,04/29/2020,How can I best help her ,"Hi - I am new the forum and I am very thankful for it! Recently, I have been home living with my sister because of all the recent quarantine orders. I have been very aware of my sisters ED. She Is diagnosed with disordered eating and does not yet fit the criteria for a specific ED. Living with her and seeing her habits form / fluctuate have been so hard for me. I just keep watching her control so much of her food and go so many days eating so little. My fear, of course, is the disease growing and becoming more and more severe. My sister is aware of her struggles and actually acknowledges how difficult it’s been for her.
I guess I am struggling with how to live with her that is supportive but also learning to cope there is not much I can do... she is older, 20, and typically at school living away from home. I also am typically not home with her but given the circumstances. I also am a fixer and it is such my instinct to be proactive and try and assist and fix the problem which we all know doesn’t work unless the person wants to get better. Any advice on how to process, and mostly learn how to not worry so much about our siblings. Also maybe just more information on what’s appropriate to support them but not push them or become fixated on things.  Thank you in advanced. I know there is so much more to this story that is too much to share.  i appreciate everyone here.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,04/30/2020-2:36pm",Dear Dunn1234,We understand your concern and want you to know that we have some resources to assist you.

5,Mothman,04-07-20,I'm not sure how to help my sister,"My sister told me nearly a year ago at like 3 am that she had been choosing not to eat for periods of time.That night I talked to her about going to see a therapist, and she told me that she wouldn't be opposed to it, she just did nOT want my mom to know why see was seeing a therapist.I told her that I would tell my mom she wanted to see someone for her social anxiety, and she agreed.I told our mom, very carefully, a few days later because I felt it was something necessary for her to know since I had been planning to move out shortly after. I told her that as far as my sister knows, she cant know, but I wanted to be sure someone in the house was aware.Long story short I didnt end up moving out, so now I still live with her. We share a room, and we recently moved to a new state. Shes not seeing a therapist anymore because of that, and she said she refuses to see another one because her last one wasn't a good fit for her.So that was the extent of it as far as I knew until a few days ago. I thought therapy and other stuff had been helping, at least a little, but I was..not correct in my assumptions.A few days ago we were talking at around 4 am, both of us drunk on sleep deprivation and being silly and dumb and laughing. When we were talking, I touched her leg because she had been pointing out something on it and then she panicked and broke down crying. I just kind of sat there because she hates people to talk to her or go near her when she panics or cries, and after a few minutes she calmed out and wiped her face and was like ""I'm fine""A few days later we went shopping and she opened up to me about it, and told me things that I hadn't been aware of before. She told me that at a time she had been restricting, and that she'd fainted several times when no one was home during that period.  She started eating more after she had fainted a few times, but even up until now shes still counting calories and wants to work down to a lower number.There's other things she talked about, like skipping dinner every other night, or how eating gives her panic attacks and I just like....I don't know that there's any way I can help her without losing her trust...and I think that's more dangerous...because at least right now she'll talk to me...We went around and bought some healthier foods that she'll eat (she's had sensory issues her whole life and cant handle eating certain foods due to texture) because I want her to be eating /something/ without her feeling horrible all the time. I asked her if we could make a deal that she'd eat more (and I could help her put together meals and stuff) if I would be willing to do workouts (mostly stuff like yoga) with her because I know shes concerned about losing weight but I feel like doing a daily, light workout would be...I dunno....safer?I'm lost on what to do. I can't be forceful about it because that never works. I cant make it clear to her that I'm worried about her because then she'll just hide it better. I have to make some sort of compromise because I'm the only one who is supposed to know...so I'm the only one who she'll even listen to at all.Our mother doesn't know about the newer things, and I don't know that I should tell her. She was willing to not go crazy the first time because as far as we knew it wasn't to a dangerous extent and she was going to therapy...but now it's a much different situation - we don't even have a doctor here at the moment.I know this post is all over the place, so I apologize, but I'm just....lost on what I can do.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,04/08/2020-6:19pm","Hey mothman, thanks for your","Hey mothman, thanks for your post.
