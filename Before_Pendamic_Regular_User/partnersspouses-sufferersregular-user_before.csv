My sense is that she knows that much of this stuff has to do with issues regarding her eating disorder, and is beginning to feel a bit backed into a corner with it all.As you said, it may revolve around control as well.   Not so much that she is in control, but the fact that she realizes that she's not really in control of it now.   Which is frequently the sort of realization that brings about reactions like this.   The person has worked so darn hard at restricting, and exerting the terrific discipline that's involved in starving themselves like that, that it can come as a real shock to them when they realize that now they can't stop restricting. even if they wanted to.Which means that rather than being in control, things have moved beyond their control instead. And now their loved ones are expecting them to do something about it, when in the back of their minds they know they can't. People can really find themselves on edge when they find themselves in that position, and that sounds like where she's finding herself now. How she's going to come to terms with this helplessness will be the thing I think.  Finally admitting that there's this huge thing that they are NOT in control of pretty much goes against every single thing they've been working towards.So yeah, the ""coming to terms"" thing.  That sounds like the next step in all of this, and it's really not an easy step to take. Bob J.",vlostwalt,"Sat,10/27/2018-4:29pm",Circle back.. Trainer/Nutritionist for couples.,"Bob, I'm very heartened that you're out there and giving a damn about my wife and I.I hope my feedback helps others too.Well after my getting frank about the situation here is what happened.She kinda cooled her anger and seemed a little happier.I don't know if it was out of spite, or if she realized she hit the wall or just nothing; but she went a certain amount of days without running on that damn treadmill. AND!!!!  She ate some normal portions and was even eating a certain food... It was remarkable.
I kept my mouth shut... as rubbing stuff in anyone's nose etc is not a good thing.I was going to tell her that it's nice to sit across from her and not worry about what she wasn't eating.... me just biding my time and realizing it may be temporary as she's danced up to the line before.  It's just nice to see her make something that looks like a normal portion and eat it and not pick at it.  It's stunning that it happened.I brought up in our mini argument that I was kicking myself for not ""green lighting "" her getting a trainer a few years ago, and that her workouts were missing ONE thing and that was the Fuel.Well I told her I've let my upper body kinda go to heck, and my cardio stamina is not what it should be so we went TOGETHER to a trainer today, like a date and at our mutual agreement.  The guy is a great fit he is a certified Trainer and NUTRITIONIST, and has an Olympic Gold medal for a team sport many years ago... he's 63 and looks fantastic. His attitude about the body being the most valuable asset we have rings very true.It's funny our evaluation is exactly what I've been seeing with her... she ""looks pretty fit"" but is pretty weak for actual strength.  Me, he found exactly  what I knew... cardio is kinda off for an my upper body needs some work.So I'm signing up with her to go twice a week to train and listen to this man.  He was delighted that we didn't eat out much... I had to almost go cross eyed when my wife said she was ""addicted to chocolates and ice-cream""  I won't do portions and stuff, and I'll give her that she does eat some of that but her restraint is the envy of every other 50ish yr old she female knows, via/examples of my previous testimony.I hope this bring she and I closer.  I have no issue with my wife's desire to be fit and trim... but getting her on a the same page with a Nutritionist (I didn't know he had that cert. until our first meeting today) seems to be money well spent.  I'll circle back in a couple weeks.",BobJ48,"Mon,10/29/2018-5:38pm",Back at you.,"Hey V,I'm glad to hear that the emotional stuff seems to have settled down for now.  That sort of scattered anger, it really can be a sign of different sorts of inner turmoil that they are dealing with.And yeah, good that you held your tongue when you saw her eating somewhat normally again.  After all, it's not really about us ( well, in theory at least) but about them working on things themselves. You'll have to see how things go with the gym.  People can go overboard there too, as it can hold a lot of the ""control"" elements that eating disorders do.   I had a GF for a while, and she kept hurting herself at the gym because of some over-excercize issues that she had which were really hard for her to get a handle on.

She knows exactly what she is doing though, and no one is being fooled,so it's got to be frustrating for all of you, and perhaps even her.

They have 4 people that are booked out months, and will not talk to me. They say the client must be the one to call and answer the screening questions.""Unfortunately the reality is that there are more people with EDs than there are therapists and treatment places to treat them.  Add that to the fact that people who end up in treatment often don't want to be there and just relapse again when they get out, and you can understand where the place that you called might have things set up so they cherry-pick the people who they choose to help.  Only those who at least have the initiative to call, in this case.( This might not be the case if you had a big pile of money. If it seems that you have lots of cash, many private treatment places would accept her I think.  But even with all that money in place, her actual success would *still* depend on her attitude, so the folks that you spoke to still have a point, as far as successful outcomes are concerned.) ""They said I can not influence a sick person, they have to accept that they have a problem.... so round we go.""They have a point with this too - One of the landmark phases in the progress of EDs is when the person decides for themselves  that they have a problem. Even that's not always the turning point though - The next phase is the decision that they're going to try and effectively fight it.  It may be that your wife has hit that first benchmark, and can admit to  herself that she does have a problem, but the second one, where she's decided to effectively fight it…she may not have reached that one yet. The psychological risks that would be involved (of which there are many) may still seem like too much for her. ""I asked if I have to threaten to leave the house to get her attention. They said ""that sometime is what it takes."" WOW!!!! ""I've read a LOT of ""What did it take for you to finally decide to recover?"" threads, and it can be all sorts of different things.  The accumulation of different sorts of consequences, or moral or existential or psychological concerns.  In some circumstances leaving might have an influence, and in others it might not.  But yeah, in some situations things do have to get drastic. "" I feel like a trapped rabbit in a den of foxes… ""Part of that feeling can come from the fact that there's no proven treatment for eating disorders.  When I first got into this I assumed that there was, but there isn't.   People do get better, so that's'true.  And people can benefit from going to treatment, so thats' true as well.  But as far as there being any sort of proven treatment, there isn't one.  On top of that, if you read writings  from people who have recovered, where they talk about what made the difference for them, their responses are all over the map.  So yeah, when we are searching for some sort of specific emotional security to latch onto…it can be a difficult matter for sure. But again, many people DO get better.  So it really can happen.  But the personal aspects of the individual plays a huge role, and while we can be supportive (which *can* indeed make a difference)  many of important parts are still out of our hands.Keep in touch, OK ?",vlostwalt,"Tue,02/05/2019-11:23am",Thanks Bob,"Thanks for responding back.I was close to snapping last night as she measured her little breakfast for the next day.Thank god despite here very thin frame and diminished stature from a couple years ago (thin then, but not scary) she is healthy.I know I'm close to a total breakdown.

I am never sure if I should answer or not.  I feel your pain.  Mental illness/addiction are terrible problems.  Reason does not work. This is not something that can be cured by anything that we do.  So, our only option is to realize that we did not cause this.  We cannot control this. We cannot cure this.  It is the same thing that people living with alcoholics or drug addicts have to come to terms with.  It is the first step that we have to take in this battle.The war is not really with their ED.  The battle is with ourselves.  We want something that they are not willing to do.  We want our reality to be different.  Wanting a different reality will not make a different reality.  So, sometimes the best thing we can do is come to terms with what we have.I'm sure that is sounding very hard.  We are asking our spouse to take care of themselves by eating.

Only issue is the symptoms of the issue; wearing a parka indoors, refusing to sit down to eat lunch rather than pace around the kitchen, not able to enjoy the surf in Maui, second guessing if she deserves dessert on a night out with her husband. These issues and many others were NOT so much a thing 8 or so years ago. She is painfully frail. The trainer we went to see together would put her through his paces, tell her what to eat when she went home and should wouldn't. He asked her her goals, and she said it was to build muscle and gain some mass. I told her I couldn't watch her do the exercise and not fuel, so I quit the trainer. Now she goes to ""pound"" on her own, comes home and diets. She is a very smart and successful business person. I just feel like I can't enjoy and evening out with her or a lunch. She's figuring out what to eat with the ""leftovers"" during dinner on our anniversary night out. Saying what she's going to cook with the items she's planning to save from dinner.

Thanks.... your insight is spot on ""diittoditto"" I can not disagree, and I bounce back and forth with being in your camp and then wondering how I can let this go on. What also kills me is how here in Indiana obesity is such a focus, that I really feel that her doctors think she's one of the few people trying to be healthy. Her gyno uses her to train her interns/residents now and then, as it's ""so easy for them to feel where her woman parts are"" she comes home every other year on how an intern was asked to feel her because it's so easy. The doctor called me back once and agreed she is very thin, but seems to be maintaining. Doctors have about 20 minutes and move one.

Dealing with any mental illness or addiction will leave you feeling used up, empty, and depressed if you are trying to ""fix"" them.  That is because it is not possible to ""fix"" anyone else.  We each fix ourselves.  Some of us don't fix ourselves and they grow worse.  But this is the battle your marriage has handed you: you must learn where your control begins and ends.You have choices:  You can stay and keep doing what you are doing that isn't working.  Will that help your spouse?  Will that help you?  You can change the dance... meaning that you change your behaviors and your responses to ones that are healthy for you.  Will that help her?  Who can say?  Will that help you... yes.You can leave.  You can decide you can't do this any more and you can build a better, happier life for yourself.  Will that help her? Who can say?  Will that help you... yes.Right off the bat you have two ways that you can improve the situation for yourself.  I bet if you think about it you will come up with more ways.  Perhaps you might seek help from a therapist.  Maybe you might decide to attend Ala-non meetings to learn the steps.  Their steps are the same ones that spouses of people with ED find helpful.  Something else that I wanted to mention is that a primary emotion we experience as we watch our spouses starve themselves to death is anticipatory grief.  Everyone dies.  It is not possible for us to stop death.  Yet, we want to.  We need to feel that control in life.  So, maybe something to focus on too goes back to the first step of coming to believe that we cannot control this.  It is not our responsibility to control this.  It is our responsibility to control ourselves; to walk on our side of the street; to keep our spoon in our own bowl.  We set and maintain our own boundaries.  We are responsible for us and our actions.  We cannot control the actions of others.Sending best wishes.

This is just wrong.What smacked me in the gut wasn't that she was still more thin that ever before; it was what do I tell my adult kids for doing next to nothing about their mom?  I'm terribly mad and frustrated my dad gave up on my mom's issues 30 or 40 years ago, I don't want my kids to harbor that kind a anger and resentment toward me or their mother.On new-years day I hand delivered a letter and evidence to her OBGYN.  I had called her before but never heard back other than my wife saying ""you've been talking to my doctor?!""The doctor is well aware and she said while my wife is generally healthy she agrees; ""she has no fat whatsoever.""
The doctor said that her being cold so often, bad hair/nails, skipping periods (in her early 40's) are big warning signs.  She said my wife hadn't told her about skipping cycles.  I said it's been going of a while.  So the doctor is going to call her in and get her referred to a councilor / nutritionist.
The doctor agreed that the situation could easily turn dire, and that if my accounts of eating small meals around big exercise events is accurate she certainly is burning muscle occasionally.Anyway, preparing for the blow-back when the doctor calls her.

There's clearly a problem, but as a partner, a person is not really being presented with anything they can do about it.  So yeah, how is a person supposed to live with that ? This is just me of course, but I wonder how self-aware she is about her situation ?  The other board I work on - the one for people who are in the midst of their EDs and who are still madly going for it - Even though many of them are still resolutely pushing forward with weight loss (often despite many bouts in the hospital) , on the whole they all know it's a problem, and in the balance, a negative thing in their life, and that the longer they press on, the deeper they are digging themselves into trouble. Not everyone feels that way of course, but the overall tribal verdict is that it's a trap that they really hate finding themselves in.  No matter how otherwise ""healthful"" their behaviors may seem to casual outsiders. After all of these years, your wife is not willing to admit to that yet ?  Because really, most people in her situation have come to that conclusion by now, even if they have not reached a point where they are willing to say it out loud.

It sounds like you gave her a pretty good run-down, and since she's a woman herself, she's probably a bit more aware of these things than a male doctor might be.

Guess what... things are still bad.She was diagnosed as a ""pre diabetic"" she now watches her food ever ever more closely.  She still goes on exercise binges without having much of a proper fueling session in the morning.My sister in law RN thinks that indeed she may be damaging her endocrine system with ""disruptive diet syndrome""  basically a body that goes from famine mode, to storage mode and back to famine mode many times a month.  I was talking to her family about reading the owners manual of some cars. It often says; ""while the low fuel warning light alerts you to the need to fuel, do not drive prolonged or always use this as a time to fuel.""  Why?  I'm a bit of a mechanic... it's because modern fuel injected cars use the fuel to cool the fuel pump, and excess fuel is recirculated in the ""loop"". So when you are down to the last gallon and a half and drive a couple times a month in the low state with no thermal reserve you eventually cook your fuel pump.My wife has been cooking her fuel pump off and on for 40 years. She judges herself harshly, one of the first things she told me about her nutritionist is ""how beautiful she is for her age.""

Things like this are frustrating alright. "" I called the nutritionist's office today and let them know that I think her eating behavior overall is worsened despite her constant vigilance on eating the right things... just not enough to support her desired activity level.""Yep, people can concentrate on ""eating the right things"" and yet still be scared to death of gaining. How they go about losing that fear is hard to say.  From a psychological standpoint, it would symbolize losing control over their life just in general.  An idea that would be frightening to anyone. So as you've observed, a person can reach an emotional point where they feel that they really have to be vigilant if they don't want to see things slip out of control.   Not enough exercise, too many calories, improper foods - in a world that's filled with enough uncertainties as it is, those things could  be a road to ruin alright. Plus I think there's often some OCD that's involved.  Anxieties surrounding certain rituals and behaviors that are almost beyond the person's control.  Psychologically OCD stuff involves feelings of safety, and who among us likes to feel unsafe ?  So it's a difficult matter alright. She'll have to be willing to take risks I think.  And to be honest, seeing the nutritionist may have felt like a risk.  Then again, she may have turned parts of it to the advantage of her ED.  If she's now ""eating properly"" then that may feed her feelings of control.   And we just ignore the fact that we're eating WAY less of the proper foods that are recommend. Ugh, sorry if I seem overly sympathetic with what she's going through.  But after all these years I'm sure you know that she's not doing these things to irritate you.  Plus, as I've mentioned before, I'm pretty sure that she knows there's a problem.  One that most likely she does not enjoy. So yeah, ""flexibility"".   That's one thing that people with EDs can complain about too.  How they've lost the ability to be flexible about so many things.  And how that inflexibility restrains them, and robs them of the sorts of carefree experiences that other people seem to be able to enjoy.  You do hear people with EDs talk about this.  How they envy the ways that other people can eat, and feel happy and flexible about things just in general. So I'm pretty sure that she knows there's a lot that she's missing out on.  Which is another sad thing about Eds.So again, it's the willingness to take risks.  And an openness to the idea that she, as her own person, might be able to change her attitude about things.  I suspect we both know how difficult it is to change our own attitudes, so for someone like her to even imagine she could…it would be a pretty brave thing, you know ? In any case, I think it's still fair to see the nutritionist thing as potentially positive.Her next brave step would be seeing a therapist, which have we talked about that before ?Bob J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,ENEMYOFED,01/19/2020,Hit and Run ,"I dont know what the heck happened. Whirlwind romance unlike any I've ever experienced, everything was perfect from the humor to the sexual attraction to both being completely vulnerable and telling each other our darkest secrets and preparing for a future...For me, I never did that before in my life...she told me all about ED and how she has risen up against it and has taken control of her life...total loving connection daily...planning a future...MAKING and booking plans for the future...then complete disconnect...she says a few days into the disconnect perhaps we got ""relationshippy"" too fast...Huh ? Then total one sided conversations from there on out...like I'm talking to myself or her just repeating what I say for the sake of responding. Like she was kidnapped...like a switch turned her off...I've tried to learn on ytube but there isnt much there about relationships...I know a lot but dont know anything it seems...im trying to be supportive but also scared for myself, heart broken and only opened it because everything went so smoothly...devastated...now I'm wondering if she could maintain a manic personality or something or was that the real her or is she really sick right now and her mind shutting down ? She was sharing her food content and strategies and maybe I shouldnt have reminded her that she missed one meal already and it was time for her next scheduled meal...maybe I triggered ED inside her to wake up ? I dont know...its just so confusing and heartwrenching and unfair...I'm lost.",BobJ48,"Mon,01/20/2020-7:45pm",Sudden pulling back.,"Hey Bud,I'll have to admit, as soon as I read your first sentence, I said to myself ""OK, here it comes - The withdrawing thing.""Because I've been on boards for partners for over ten years now, and I gotta tell you, this is absolutely the number one scenario that guys write about.  Things are just wonderful, their partner is an authentically wonderful person, and in a moment of intimacy, the person reveals their ED. This sort of sharing is a really intimate matter, but rather than creating an atmosphere of trust and increased closeness as one might expect, much to the dismay and puzzlement of the fellow, their partner starts withdrawing instead.  I've heard this same story literally hundreds of times, so you have plenty of company when it comes to this unsettling outcome.If I had to guess, it has to do with the fact that she understands that since you are such a loving and caring fellow, it follows that you're naturally going to have hopes that she recovers. Which…a lot of people with EDs don't really want to do.  Or alternatively, they believe it's something which is impossible for them.  So they begin to understand that sooner or later they and their circumstances are going to evolve into a disappointment for you. Plus the knowledge of your sure-to-happen expectations can create anticipatory stress and guilt, which can cause their ED thoughts to get worse. Basically they see your kind-hearted and good intentions as inevitably going for nothing, and the whole thing is just evolving into this big emotional tragedy.   So best to pull back and disengage before things come to that point.  For the good of the both of you.Or some variation on that mode of thinking. Which is a pathway of thinking that gets WAY ahead of the game, but even so, it's a pattern that you hear about a lot.Plus yes, the part about suddenly being unable to get through to the person.  It leaves us personally stuck with a lot of feelings alright, so I'm glad you took this opportunity to write.What to do about all of this, I'm not sure, particularly if she really seems like she has cut herself off from you. If it seems that she is still listening, my might say that you understand that she probably has a lot of fears about how the relationship might go. Which I suspect is what's at the heart of all this. Because yeah, what a bummer. I think you can count on the fact that she is the wonderful person that she seems to be, but EDs really can derail a person's ability to see those good parts of themselves, and they can come to view themselves as an inevitable source of pain and disappointment instead. So you'll just have to see how it goes I think.  It's not impossible that she'll let you into her life again, and people with EDs will sometimes say what a difference a caring partner has made for them. But a lot of it will hinge on her own thinking, and the stage of her ED that she finds herself in, along with the amount of hope she will allow for herself. Which may not be much at the moment.Anyhow, just some thoughts.  Keep writing ?",ENEMYOFED,"Mon,01/20/2020-11:14pm","About to let me go..forever. Or is it ""ED"" pushing me away ?","Wow...I'm so grateful its you Bob...Thank you such much for responding, I feel like you're a celebrity therapist...a guru...a shaman...and a warlock all wrapped up in one person who can maybe help navigate this troubling world of sorcery known as ""ED"" (Eating Disorder. I've been checking over and over the past couple days to see if a reply or even if my query would be accepted on this forum, and as sad and confused as I am, I feel elated that you're willing to help me, and its you. I've read as much as I could since I found this forum, and saw a few of your replies to partners just like me, ""the withdrawing thing"" whoa, we're THAT common ?? Yikes...I was shocked to see that some of the situations mirrored mine almost to a tee, all had a common ground, and I think the only reason shes still listening is because of your advice I found that was given to others. She told me to stop leaving messages for her, which I thought next would be the ""just stop calling/texting me"" statement which seem to be the pattern of how it goes for unfortunate souls like myself. I saw your advice to one person and coupled it with a husband in one video on ytube that explained in depth of how a sufferer of ED is STILL caring for you, and probably still loves us more than anything, which is why she will leave forever...because that's whats best for me,  (what ?!?! I WANT NEED to be WITH YOU FOREVER, I LOVE YOU !...and she loves me too, so she has to leave,to protect me.. I think thats kinda the wonky gist of it ?) Nurture over nature ?...at least to the ED affected mind it seems the proper decision for them to make...which makes ""ED"" my enemy, as stated in my username lol...and they do this while distancing themselves from what could be the greatest bond any two people could share together...its such a contradiction of sorts but so very true, I know it has to be, because she has done everything described in your forecasting of how the nature of these events fall out ...I thought yesterday was it,done, kaput, finito, broken forever...I thought she'd disconnect from all social media to me and not take my calls, but I read as much as I could here, I read as many partner posts male or female that I could find and you responded to many...you are a gift to this community Bob, everyone is I know, but you really stand out and speak in a way that made me step back and try to look at this as rational and as caring as I can without the emotional knee jerking (which I was initially doing, like ""what happened ? Are you in psychosis ? Did you take a new medication ? The Who What When Where Why and.. HOW ?!!"")...this has truly buckled me...So I've tried to do exactly what I've done all along, LOVE her...period...no matter what...its what I promised her from the get go...she told me EVERYONE in her life leaves...So I'm finding my own ""how"" to love her unconditionally with or without her... and so the last volley of interactions went like this, she said my ""messages is causing a lot of anxiety and need you to please slow up""..I left a bunch of light hearted and humorous messages the other night while I couldn't sleep, we did this for each other, but she was beginning to cut me off totally and not responding to any of them now...wont answer my calls either...However, I did mention how I was concerned about her recovery, and she replied ""my recovery is fine, I’m doing great, And it’s my responsibility."", she also said she needed ""quiet (her name) time""...Ouch...Oh boyyy did I step in it...and then I put my other foot in it...seems I'm a glutton for punishment, but I'm so emotionally confused with so many waves of contradictory feelings that overwhelm me, like I love her, I hate her for doing this, Why is this happening, the once in a lifetime search was someones manic episode ? How is ED winning over me ? Why does ED win over everyone ?, it becomes a seriously negative and unforgiving thought pattern...I emotionally knee jerked with a response saying that ""I get it. I never implied ever that it wasn't (the recovery responsibility, she never said that before)ok. I never said it was my responsibility...i expected that response. I'll stop messaging.""...and she replied to that with a similar tone now stating ""I’m here as your friend and recovery pal but need time to myself right now""...Wait a sec...WHAT ?!?! ""Recovery pal"" ?!?! ...hold the phone Chuck, ""PAL ?!?!""...HIT..AND..RUN. These drive bys are harsh Bob. So unforgivably harsh...but that's ""ED"" for ya...I'm getting it now, I'm REALLY getting it. Thanks to all your responses Bob, I'm beginning to really have an understanding of this sneaky bastard...and all the anger and confusion I was feeling is being replaced and lifted with care and concern, and love...slowly...I wish it was instant, but I'm working on it..because those positive feelings were always there, until ""ED"" popped in and began to hijack her brain, again, yet this time my brain was available too...""ED"" can cover or mask my true feelings by throwing the blanket of confusion, anger, and negative emotions over me through her, to blindfold me in a way, not to see who is responsible for all of this...its not her for me to blame..or I...its ED..Period..something that I never saw at his level, ED never came to the surface like it has now, and stuck around..it visited, but never stayed... That is NOT her. Its ""ED"". My new enemy who was there all along...At least..I think..I've been dwelling on so many comments I may have made not knowing enough about ED that may have contributed to triggering her and letting ED surface again, I know this kind of rumination doesn't help but it seems to keep surfacing nonetheless,I really haven't figured out how to cope with all of this yet, I'm trying, and learning much much more..too late it seems..I've studied as much as possible from the beginning but was so focused on the science of it, the nutrition, the techniques to help her survive and maintain a healthy weight, all of the practical scientific approaches but none of the partner related consequences that could accompany a relationship...Are us loved ones responsible for triggering the ED sufferer because we don't know enough ?!? I feel so foolish not examining it enough, like all the relationships she had prior to me that she talked to me about...I thought I was doing more than the rest, but obviously not..how she'd tell me her own family and every romantic relationship she'd ever been in wasn't willing to learn enough about ED or just how important it was for her to ""keep"" ED in her life...I thought she had it in check..I dropped the ball..I tried not to dive into it being she'd been through treatment for it in various times in her life, and to me it seemed like she finally had control over it enough to take giant leaps with me, and plan for a future together, which we did and were doing, and open up in a way she never experienced before with anyone, because finally as she would say, shes on a road to do it all ""without"" ED, that was her goal she'd say...I told her we'd make it through it all and beat all roadblocks by dancing through the fire alongside her, because it seemed everyone would always abandon her when ED shows up, which it never had for me...at least, not at this level..I learned daily about ED following ED sites and reading daily something that would help, not enough though...it peeked in, but boy did it wait for the most opportune time to strike and kidnap the woman I love whilst trying to make my brain a scrambled gobbledygook of confused, angry, and nearly unbearable emotions...which led me here, to try and figure it all out and win..to be the fixer like I've always tried to be...except this time..I'm lost..I'm hurt more than I've ever been in life at this moment..My heart and my brain are suffering emotional trauma...again...I feel ransacked..and as smart and resourceful as Id like to think I am.. I didn't even see it coming. What a maroon...oh boyy I just went on a tangent there, sorry...I just start typing and am just trying to get it all out hoping that maybe all of it will help me or someone else, just like all the other posts have helped me, so I'm trying to give an insight into it all...sorry its so wordy and most likely confusing, I appreciate it if you've made it this far, thank you...ok, so I was just told ""Recovery Pal"", ""quiet time needed"" and she's close to ending all messaging it seems...so this morning all I wrote was ""Good morning, hope you have a brilliant week. I believe in you. I'm here for you.I love you.""...to which she replied ""Thank you. Have a great day as well. Be strong and be brave.""...which I imagine is the polite precursor to being told to shove off for good, if this common pattern continues...I think she's telling me to ""Be strong and brave"" because its preparing me to accept life without her, which I don't want at all..I'd love to weather this storm and all storms ahead if she's willing to, with ED if that's the case...I embraced that from the beginning...but from what I've read so far with all the others who've gone through this, its inevitable that she will disengage from me...forever...and I wish there was a way to navigate a different ending...Sadly, I should probably begin to work on the acceptance of it...to be in love and lost at the same time is a cruel hand both of us were dealt. My apologies if this is all over the place, but I'm just kinda shooting from the hip at the moment while trying to absorb everything you've just told me as well...I'll definitely follow up to this being I know its helpful to me as well as anyone who stumbles here like I did...its truly been helpful in all of its perspectives.Thank you NEDA and thank you Bob. I still hope. I'm not giving up. Maybe I can change the script on this one. I hope.",BobJ48,"Tue,01/21/2020-5:33am",Yep.,"First off, try not to beat up on yourself if it doesn't seem like you approached all this in a perfect manner.  This stuff is complicated, and ""normies"" can't be expected to understand it if they don't have prior experience. As I suspect you are seeing, EDs are a lot more than simply the person trying to get thin, or somehow punishing themselves.  And while they may hate their condition, they aren't aways ready to get rid of it either.Also, watch out for your feelings of helplessness. You're seeing how much they can upset us, so you'll want to stay calm.  If she starts feeling like she is responsible for you being in a tizzy, she's likly to pull away even more.  People with EDs hate the idea of being a burden on others.  Besides, they often feel like it's their own private thing, which to a large degree it is.Watch out for the ""rescuing"" thing too. It's a real temptation to take on that mindset, and if we really care about someone, it's hard to completely set those sorts of feelings aside, but again, the person may see it as intrusive.In my experience, the ""Love is all you need"" cure is unlikely to work either. Not that we should, or can, avoid feeling affection for the person, but laying it on thick can sometimes feel like pressure too. One other thing to keep in mind is that EDs are often about control. (Insert long explanation of the control thing here )  If you start coming at the thing hard, it may give the impression that you have hopes of exerting some kind of control yourself, and that's going to feel like a real deal-breaker to her. So basically you want to project a calm sense of support, a level-headed appreciation for what she's dealing with, and unless she tells you otherwise and spells out how she would like you to help her, you have faith that she'll be able to stay on top of things and make the right choices for herself.  You also know that sometimes she may not make the right choices, but how that kind of comes with the territory too.I also try and avoid cheerleading.  ""I know you can do it !!""  You'll probably want to cool it with that sort of approach as well, as it may give the impression that you just don't get it. I do think it's fine to tell her that you believe she is a good person. People with EDs can often question that about themselves.  But as an outside observer, that's how it continues to look to you. It's a reasonable and supportive stance I think.But you don't want to appear like you are losing it if she's not replying to you. It's hard to know how things stand now, but if she is asking for space, I'd be saying "" I understand where things could be feeling intense, and how you might be feeling that way"" and then wait and see how things proceed from there.I know the situation feels tumultuous and unsettled, but you're Joe Cool ; understanding but calm.  Even if you have to fake it a little.",ENEMYOFED,"Tue,01/21/2020-7:38am",I hope. ,"Yep...thanks for getting through my word salad, really wish I didn't just throw everything out there like that but I've been flying by the seat of my pants and I guess I just needed to vent too...I'm buckled, but am much more understanding of it all than I was a few days ago.All points well taken Bob...I'm not going to rescue (impossible), no lovebombing (I think it really annoys all ED's from my experience and reading), no more beating myself up over things I could never have enough time to understand ( Its so complex, it takes a lifetime), no cheer-leading (I was never really a fan of that anyway, they like subtle support in my experience), and I guess all I can really do is exist ( Be here for her, unconditionally on her )...in the sense to just deal with everything as it is and breathe...slowly...through it all like one long exhale..and like you said..Joe Cool style. One of the major things I was really surprised at was how we immediately feel so helpless, but then get sandbagged by the tricky way they can upset us to varying degrees with no discussion or reasoning at all....and we better not bring up ED.. Thats when the Joe Cool chill tude is really necessary to offset that knee jerk responding like a high school kid...its unsettling how those feelings come to surface and logic is late to the party during this sudden transitioning phase...so, stepping back and reflecting about all our interactions and taking time to understand each individual exchange or situation has become paramount moving forward. It always was, but everything is so magnified now, when they're in, or under, or coupled with ""control"" of ED that every response needs to be given with extra care, credence, and compassion. ED has a reach I totally underestimated...and was certain that it couldn't reach me in a negative way...not so. One thing I haven't delved into yet is the whole ""control"" issue. I've studied it some, but its so complex I think I'd need 4 years of study for me to be somewhat articulate in trying to discuss the nature of it in a forum of this magnitude. Really appreciated your ""insert long explanation here)"" lol, because I've read a bunch of the control posts and boy is it an infinite topic to delve into.I'm sorry for writing so much, probably too much...and in looking at it now I suppose I really needed a soundboard to validate a lot of what I'm feeling, thinking my circumstance was much worse than everything I've read already, but, not so much at all. Most important to me right now is to gain a greater understanding of ED of how I can be a better person of support than I was...I'm grateful that I found NEDA, and I hope to utilize all they have to offer and am looking into volunteering or interning to gain a greater understanding of all ED's and just be of help to anyone whether my own relationship works out or not. This experience will make us both better people no matter how it plays out...I know since she said she needs quiet time, that she NEEDS quiet time, and to respect her needs which is what has always been the most important thing to me knowing that recovery is so difficult for sufferers of ED and that I've always told her to put herself first over anything including me because prior to me she didn't really practice self care and love...and she still struggles with it, always putting others first.. but has gotten better at it and utilizes all the support now that she receives from her recovery support system. Also, one other thing I've noticed is how social media can become a huge part of their lives, some negative...not sure if its a total negative but it is something to be noted and hopefully I can assess just how much if at all in the future..I think if I could do it all over again, I should have made more time to learn of so much I should've known before one decides to spend a life with a sufferer of ED. No matter how much she says all is fine and its all good, we should always educate ourselves as much as possible about any struggle the person we love is dealing with, in depth. Its a devious disorder, all the ED's are, and even though I spent time in the medical industry I was never taught too much about ED's, and that's probably where I've been beating myself up the most...but we love, and trust...and learn. Life. What a ride.       So this becomes the fragile time where I have to take my love and faith and put trust into the hands of the person I love... whom I hope still loves me... And hope that during this period of uncertainty that she will still love and care for me in a way that allows me to do it again. I hope.",BobJ48,"Tue,01/21/2020-2:46pm",Back at you.,""" ED has a reach I totally underestimated...and was certain that it couldn't reach me in a negative way...not so.""Here's one thing I've noticed. There's a part of ourselves that wants to believe that once we educate ourselves about something…once we get it mapped out in our minds, somehow that's going to protect us from the emotional effects of the thing.  ""Knowledge is Power"" and all that. But when it's someone we are personally close to, it just doesn't work out that way.  No matter how much we know, it still effects us.  So if you still feel kind of crazy, that's just part of it.   From an emotional standpoint, when someone we love has a problem, it's our problem too, and it's kind of hard to escape that.""This experience will make us both better people no matter how it plays out.""  Yes, hopefully so. But for yourself, most likely.  When it comes to understanding other people, it's a whole other world when it comes to EDs. But as time goes on, you may come to understand that many of the issues they are dealing with aren't so different than the sorts of emotional themes that any sensitive person deals with on some level.  Our sense of lack or attainment of personal power, how we do or do not fit into the world, the often-fragile sense of our self-worth and worthiness.  Are we a good person or not ?  These aren't such odd issues, really, but when they get tangled up like they can, things like EDs can be the curious outcome. Plus, you've got this thing going that helps you feel in control, and you're doing pretty good at it, until you realize that now it's controlling you instead, and on top of that, you are finding it almost impossible to escape from ?  Imagine what that must be like, and the various states of mind it might put you in ? So yes, a lot of aspects of human existence that we may not have had to think about before. And just as a general thing, hopefully that's an angle helps us grow wiser. I'm kind of involved in the social media thing which you may be referring to, and rather than giving a lot of suggestions, I'm mostly ""I can only imagine how difficult this must be.""  ""It's gotta suck, I know."" and that sort of general approach. This may seem like stating the obvious, and going with the negative, but people do appreciate that you at least get that part. So what's the situation now ?  Is it still seeming like she's not wanting to hear from you ? If so, that can be a roadblock too.  And like you said, we gotta find some way to be comfortable with the fact that that part is all in their hands.",ENEMYOFED,"Tue,01/21/2020-9:21pm",Comfortable being uncomfortable,"""But when it's someone we are personally close to, it just doesn't work out that way. No matter how much we know, it still effects us. So if you still feel kind of crazy, that's just part of it.""Indeed Bob...not gonna lie, I do feel kinda crazy..I am BUCKLED.  Devastated being I was planning to spend the rest of my life with her and making the concrete plans both emotionally and financially to do so. I love her…and yes, this event has made me crazy somewhat with the 5 stages... denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance...I'm having a tough time with the acceptance...but I'm trying..I go from being rational and taking a medical or scientific approach as to why this happening and how much ED has played a part in all of this to waving my fist in the air with confusion, sadness and mourning. Its an emotional overload for me at the moment. I'm a sensitive person who has a high emotional IQ in many respects. So is she. It was uncanny how we could sense things were off sometimes, and when we did it opened up an immediate discussion to alleviate any of our insecurities or worries, and we both attributed it to our emotional IQ being able to sense and work through these moments...However, it didn’t happen this time…as much as I requested a discussion on the matters at hand, THIS time it was different... I’ve never seen ED get this much control over her as well…it scared the crap out of me how it appears to have kidnapped the woman I know and love…I’m not sure if others feel like that with ED partners, but the drastic change which happened overnight brought me to my knees…I’m still bewildered by it al to be honest. Having a high emotional IQ also has a negative sides being we put up walls to protect ourselves…our whole lives…yet all of my walls she penetrated and pierced like no other relationship I ever experienced. I let her in. She knew exactly what to say, how to say it, and with my heart in her hand was careful and compassionate in helping me confront many of my own demons whilst sharing with me the demons that haunt her...I never let anyone all the way in, which was probably why my prior long term relationships always failed in the end…this time I shared all my trauma with her…all my baggage from childhood and adolescence was shared with her, and she shared all of hers with me…Something she told me she never did with anyone prior to me…and now I have felt feelings of regret surface for doing so...I know that's irrational, I am grateful for the growth she opened up for me to experience and have healed even more as a person because of the care and compassion she provided. I'm just feeling shattered that I may not get the privilege to heal alongside her and help her heal, or just help her cope with the weight of all she carries and continue what was a  loving and comforting support system for both of us, holding each others hearts carefully and compassionately…I worry that she may get worse, and lose more weight…miss more meals...and as you've mentioned which holds true...Her problem is my problem, and loving someone makes us not want to escape it, in fact I think it drives us even more to confront every issue they are suffering from hoping to either alleviate or eradicate their suffering on any level and provide the solace they require. However, her feeling is ""my recovery is fine, I’m doing great, And it’s my responsibility."" ..which creates a real problem for any way I approach it. I feel at the present moment that I’m walking on eggshells and any interaction has to be given great care and consideration so as not to upset her or it may be the last exchange I’ll ever have with her…which breaks my heart.  At least in my mind I became ""The Little Engine That Could"" and I think I can...not really knowing just how heavy the load of ED I'm trying to pull is, or what tools I need, or if the ones I was acquiring and did acquire were helping or being applied correctly...self doubt again just crushing through the surface...or if I'm even in the vicinity of the right toolbox...doubt creeps in...Uncertainty...self doubt…for both of us I presume...but when this occurs, their feelings of uncertainty compared to ours are at two completely different heights of understanding. I think that yes ""Knowledge Is Power"", but conceivably there's also a school of thought that ""Knowledge Is a Burden""..,a burden we'd like to carry for them if possible, which it isn't...but trying is what makes it all work I think, to a degree.. Illustrating to them we care, that its not a burden to us, that yes we are a good person…that not only do we have compassion for their suffering, but that we are willing to learn where others haven't and have failed them... and unfortunately in this process maybe we get tricked at a certain point into the mindset that perhaps ""love is all you need"" can address all the issues . Nope. That doesn’t seem to work either. Is this how it all gets tangled up ? I don’t know. I’m lost. “So what's the situation now ? Is it still seeming like she's not wanting to hear from you ?”Situation…hmmm..SNAFU comes to mind. I don’t think she wants to hear from me. Well, I kinda know she doesn’t. She told me to be strong and be brave the last time she wrote back…I don’t know what that means, and took it as a precursor to just not talking to me anymore as I’ve seen in some of the other posts by partners of ED sufferers…I sent something generic yesterday mentioning how I was making phone calls she knew I was making about some of the plans we were making and nobody was returning my calls, to only find out it was a holiday yesterday and they were not around anyway.. I though it was funny my forgetfulness of the holiday and she didn’t reply back…but she spends time on all social media platforms communicating to other people, so that’s a strong enough message to me that she doesn’t want to interact with me at all…and I’m accepting that…well I’m trying to…just preparing myself for what seems so many other partners to a person w ED before me have gone through and that my hopes of flipping the script would probably be in vain anyway… It’s a roadblock, one that I just don’t know how to circumvent…and I also want to protect myself through this…I’m hurt enough, I really don’t want to drag out something that sadly wont make any difference to a person with ED…or just a temporary difference that will result in me suffering all over again even though I’m willing to take that risk…How she was able to just flip a switch, or ED flipped the switch to not even want to converse with me about any of it has been a difficult pill to swallow. We were always extremely caring about each others feelings and worries determined to resolve any difficulties in our path. This time it feels as if I was never even in her picture of the future…I know that’s not true, that its ED talking, but I’ve never experienced the disconnect or being untethered from her to this degree. I’m lost. Conversing with strangers on the internet over me…I guess kinda like I’m doing with you Bob, so maybe I’m wrong for feeling this way about some of the things I feel, but a lot of her interactions that are visible to me are random interactions that maybe make others feel good, and I know they make her feel good too… for a like, a share, a click, a tweet, and all the other positives that I do indeed recognize that social media can bring to anyone… especially someone struggling with something as powerful as ED which requires constant distraction which indeed social media does provide. I’m glad its there for her to be honest…shes good at it, and has a gift for making people feel good with a few kind words… BUT, there’s a part of me that’s selfish and says what happened to us ? We were planning a life ?  And the negative cycle of thought begins again…it’s a process I know…I’m trying to take all the right steps to learn as much about ED as I can…to understand her more than I did…to seek out the ways to lessen the grip ED has on her...and to just be here for her should she decide that its worth it…We’re worth it…She’s worth it…I’m willing to wait and sacrifice all I have if I can save what we have together…its everything I’ve ever wanted but its all in her hands now…and all I can do is keep learning, loving, and living…with the hope we become tethered again to battle together against ED for a lifetime if necessary…Its uncomfortable, and maybe that’s where I need to be…being comfortable being uncomfortable…Its so worth it, so I wait.I don't know what else to do.",ENEMYOFED,"Wed,01/22/2020-5:41pm",Thats it. Shes cut all ties. its Kaput. ,So I've reached the point where she doesn't respond at all. I'm guessing I just need to cancel all the financial moves I made and was making for us to protect myself. There really is no proper way to navigate through this situation when an ED sufferer ends the relationship out of nowhere and within 24 hours moves on with their lives like we've never existed...its as uncomfortable a feeling as we can suffer and being comfortable with it will take a long time I imagine.

Thanks for the help.,BobJ48,"Wed,01/22/2020-9:06pm","""That's it ""","Hey.As you said :  ""but the drastic change which happened overnight…""Pretty crazy huh ?  But that's definitely how it can happen. And how it's happened with a zillion other guys too.So which of the persons that we saw was the ""real person"" ?  I've been on message boards with these folks for over 20 years now, and I always feel that we are seeing the ""real person"" when we see them like you saw her in the first place.  But as you've seen, EDs can really do a number on the ways that a person looks at the world, looks at themselves, and and how they look at  relationships too. The real person can see all the wonderful things in a relationship, but once ED pokes his head up,  relationships can look like a source of emotional danger and potential intrusion.   Like it's just not worth going there, you know ?  So the person begins to withdraw.Again, keep an eye on the rescuing thing.  Yeah yeah, if they would only accept our care and affection, then somehow things would get better.  And there may be a bits of truth to that, but as I expect you've seen on other occasions, truth doesn't always play the role we might hope that it does. Anyhow, from a practical standpoint it's probably best to just go along, and write this off as bad business.  But we are emotional creatures, and it's true ; it can be hard to be pragmatic for some of us.   So yes, if this continues to eat at you for a while, that's only natural I think.But again, hopefully there's been some wisdom to gain from this too.  And I don't mean ""Keep away from people who seem sketchy"".  More that we've had some special experience with the ways in which people can be effected by things.

Its difficult to find that the woman I waited for my entire life I have to write off as ""bad business""...damn...no lie I'm heartbroken...Striving and Letting Go...Triumphs and Traumas...in a weird way I felt like I was in the movie ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" where the woman has her memory of her boyfriend wiped clean from her mind...and I have to accept that as bizarre and unforgiving as it is...

When this whole thing started with my GF, I felt so lost. And a lot of the time, I still do. But regardless of how the situation ultimately plays out, I'm just thankful to feel a little less alone during what has been a difficult time in my life.  If, by chance, you happen to see this message and are willing to share, I'd love to hear any updates concerning your situation. My girlfriend (now ex-) and I had spent two of the best years of our lives together, the intimacy and honesty was unmatched, and we had been planning to build a life together.

2,BobJ48,02-06-20,Moss3467 - Similar Boat.,"Hey Moss,I hope it's OK, but I started this thread to reply to you.And gosh, what an experience, huh ?   We think we have somewhat of a handle on how people can be, and then something like this comes along !  I have a pretty good idea of how confusing it must be.And yeah, suddenly you are this terrible guy !  When several moments before you were wonderful. That has to be hard to make sense of as well.  Plus, when things were going well, they were wonderful between the two of you !Here's the ""None of us are doctors"" disclaimer.  Because none of us are.   But having said that, you might want to read up on Borderline Personality Disorder, because this really sounds like what you are dealing with here.   Black and white thinking ( one moment you are great, the next moment you are terrible)  ""Tumultuous interpersonal relationships"". The self-harm thing with her banging her head. ""Impulsiveness"" in certain areas of her life.  ""Fear of abandonment"" (all those texts that you got).  Along with things like eating disorders, and an unstable sense of themselves.In the psychiatric community sometimes these folks are thought of as the clients from hell.   Which really is unfair I believe.  You saw the sort of a nice person she could be, and I believe it's a mistake to ignore that.  I worked on a message board for people with BPD, and I can tell you that they aren't particularly happy about how they find themselves behaving, and will often speak with regret about the relationships they've ruined. As you saw, ""tramatic events from the past"" are often involved too.  You didn't mention the details, but it's not hard to imagine what they might be.   There's a thought that things like this might be at the root of the condition, and what brought it on in the first place, but no one really knows for sure.Also, it's possible that you should not expect things to change.  And that if you should get together again, you'll need to set some boundaries for yourself, as to what you will and will not put up with.  And let her know what those are and stick with them.One persistent idea in the mental health profession is that folks with BPD are unable to develop any insight into their condition, but in my experience that's not true at all.   But she'll probably need to start working on that part, and working on her self-awareness,  if she's not going to continue befuddling other well-intentioned people in the same ways that she's confused you.

3,vincent_cs,02/15/2020,Girlfriend with bulimia,"Hey guys,So this is actually my first time posting on a blog or in a community like this, so i'm a little nervous.... let me first introduce myself and my girlfriend: We are both from the Netherlands and we've met at highschool in 2013 when we were just 14 years old. When I met my girlfriend she was having trouble with being bullied and she allready had a light form of bulimia. After a couple months she got rid of it by herself and she was healthy for a couple of years until we both went to university. Slowly but surely it returned unfortunately. However, she allways managed to controll her ""disease"". Since november 2019 however, her situation got worse.... she started getting massive eating frenzies which was the cause of her throwing up multiple times each day. At the beginning of januari she opened up to eveyone close to her, about being really ill, and being in need of professional help.Since that time, I've been trying be with her as much as I can. Of course, sometimes it is simply not possible to be with her, however we did go for a week of skiing together, and after that we were a full week together by ourselves. At the beginning of the period where her situation got out of hand, I felt like I was kinda in control of the situation. However, right now I'm starting to feel like I'm losing grip because every bit of enerty I put into her feels like it doesn't help at all, sometimes maybe even work against her persuit of eating normal again. The reason I write this is because I'm pretty much losing track of my own mental state. I do want to be happy towards her and I do want to cheer her up as much as possible. However, looking back at the past couple of weeks, it doesn't seem like anything i've tried to do for her, made any difference. This means that I've reached the point where I do not know anymore how to help her properly, which is why I've come here.If there is no response to my post at all, it'll be allright. Just putting my story out here helps me a lot personally. However, if someone has any tips or do's and don'ts for me, just to be able to help my girlfriend as much as possible, I'll be very happy to hear them.Yours sincerely,
Vincent",BobJ48,"Mon,02/17/2020-3:08pm",Vincent ,"Hey Vincent,Eating disorders are difficult things.  You mentioned that she's had some bulimia issues when she was 14, and you are probably right in thinking that it was connected with the helplessness she felt over being bullied. Eating disorders can give people a feeling of control, and bullying is something that can cause people to feel like they have no control. As you have seen though, EDs can return, and when they do, instead of giving the person a sense of control, it can be just the opposite, and can turn into a cycle that's really hard for them to escape. ""...  now I'm starting to feel like I'm losing grip because every bit of energy I put into her feels like it doesn't help at all, sometimes maybe even work against her persuit of eating normal again.""Yes, it really can feel like nothing we do is helping. And like the whole thing is beyond our control.  Kind of like it must feel to her as well.  Like the ED has taken over. ""...I write this is because I'm pretty much losing track of my own mental state. ""Yes, I understand, and you are not alone in feeling this way.  In life we are accustomed to our efforts making a difference, and when they don't seem to be doing anything at all, we really can begin to question ourselves.  And even question reality sometimes.One thing which may help is to try and accept what you can and cannot do.  We would like to think we can rescue the person and make them better, but changes like that can be out of our hands.   We can also think that ""Love is all you need""…but often that doesn't work either.  So things like this can challenge a lot of our assumptions about life, and leave us feeling unsettled and questioning things. But if we can't cure the person, does that mean that there is nothing we can do ?  And that none of our efforts are making a difference ?   Often we like to see things in black or white :  either we are helping, or we are useless.  But that's a way of seeing things that we need to guard against I think, even though it can be human nature for us to see things that way.What I mean is, I do believe that you are helping, even if it doesn't seem like you are.  And while we can't fix them, I believe that we can be supportive of them during their difficult times. We have to be prepared for the person seeming discouraged, but we can't let that discourage us. But you are right :Sometimes we can need help ourselves too, so I'm glad that you took the time to write here.   I know that this note may not have contained much in the way of magic solutions, but just being able to talk to someone else who has a feeling for what we are going through can help I think.So I do hope that you can keep writing.Bob J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,Evaldrynn,01-07-20,A little lost ,"My boyfriend (20) and I (21) have been together for ten months now, and about seven months ago he found out he has Bulimia Nervosa (which probably started about 4-5 years ago, if not earlier on). I'm very happy I convinced him to go to therapy, but now, after only three months of being with the program, he feels like it isn't working and at one point even told me he wanted to stop. Luckily I could convince him to keep going,because I know therapy takes time, but he isn't happy about it.Our relationship is great and we both love each other very much, though his ED does complicate things sometimes. A few nights ago we got into an argument and he said he wanted me to worry about him less and to focus less on his eating disorder. To give you some context: I have never pushed him about anything nor demanded information; I always try to be kind, considerate, patient, and to give him space when he tells me he needs it. I don't voice my worries often, but when I do I try to talk about them as calmly as I can. The way this conversation started, however, was with me bursting out in tears because I saw him fall back into his self-destructive patterns and it hurt to see, because I care so much about him and all I want is for him to get better and to get happier. (I know that it can take a long time for him to recover but I'm committed and definitely willing to stand by his side for however long it might take). During the argument he told me that his Bulimia is part of who he is, part of his personality, and that I think therapy is some kind of miracle-working thing and that I have too many expectations of him. I just think it will help him a lot is all, and I don't expect recovery soon at all. But it hurt to hear him say that his ED is part of him, because it makes me feel like he doesn't want to change. The therapy program only lasts for about seven or eight months I believe, which I found a little strange. Is it really possible for such a short time to help him? I do already see progress, even though he doesn't see it himself. He used to distance himself from me when he had a binge attack, but now he still allows me to come over. His mood swings are less intense (or he hides it better), he talks about his ED more easily now, and there's lots of other small things that make me so proud of him. But sometimes it feels like he is faking being happy just so I don't get suspicious or hurt, like he's putting on an act to hide his own pain. So yeah, I'm not really sure what to do. He wants me to not worry about him, to not focus on his ED, and I'll try, but I care so deeply for him that it's hard not to get sad when he talks negatively about himself etc, and there are so many little things that are affected by his ED that it's hard not to see or notice them. I do also want to voice my thoughts and feelings, because I know that communication is important and that keeping it in only makes it worse. I want to know what's going on with him to a certain extend so I can be there for him, so I can ask him what he needs and what I can do for him, but I feel like asking about it might just frustrate him more and he doesn't tell me on his own accord. I guess I just want to know if anyone has had similar experiences. What did you do or say? What helped and what didn't? Should I not mention his ED at all and let him figure it out with his Therapist? That seems a bit rough, but then again it doesn't feel right to 'meddle' when he doesn't want me to. On the other hand, is this a way of enabling himself more regarding his secret binges? Does this give him the space to slip back into old habits? I feel like I should be at least a little involved or informed about how he's doing so I can motivate him to keep going or support him when he's had a bad day/week, but if he says he doesn't want me to, then I shouldn't pry either, right? I'm just a little lost about it all. Please, if you have had any similar experiences, let me know your thoughts.",BobJ48,"Tue,01/07/2020-8:07pm",What to do...,"Hey there.As you said, recovery can be a difficult thing, particularly when the person seems so down on themselves, and seems convinced that they may never change.  It can be discouraging to hear talk like that."" During the argument he told me that his Bulimia is part of who he is, part of his personality, and that I think therapy is some kind of miracle-working thing and that I have too many expectations of him. ""No kidding, eating disorders can put the person in a bad mood.  When they are at their worst ED-type thoughts can fill their minds for really large portions of their waking hours.  When a person finds their thoughts soaking in that sort of stuff pretty much all of the time, they really can begin to believe that it's what defines them, even when the truth may be otherwise.Even so, I think you are right to be encouraged by what seems like progress.  Often the person can't notice it themselves , but the fact that you can should not be discounted.  Even if there may still be a long road ahead. I think it's good that you are continuing to encourage him to stick with therapy.  He may be right in thinking it's not a miracle cure, and that he's not noticing any big improvements, but at the same time, it's not nothing either. Another thing to keep in mind is that since therapy encourages people to confront issues which they may have been avoiding, the stress of that sort of confrontation really can cause people to feel like they are getting worse rather than better.  It's not an uncommon feeling to have when a person first starts therapy.Otherwise it sounds to me like your approach is a good one, even if it seems like he's not telling you that it is.  I've had several people who I've supported for years, and it's only after a couple of years in that they'll stop and say Thank you.  So if he's not thanking you on a regular , don't let it make you feel like somehow you aren't helping.  From all you've said I think you can have faith that you are. Also, I get what you mean when you wonder about how much you should involve yourself.  One thing to keep in mind is that he IS going to know that you are concerned, even if you don't talk about it all the time.  So I don't think that you are enabling him if you aren't pressuing him - I hope you won't worry about that.Even so, any caring partner - even in relationships that don't involve matters like this - are going to be asking how the other partner is doing. So I don't think it should be considered intrusive for you to ask.  It's not prying, it's caring, you know ?And hopefully he'll realize that too.In any case, I know that I may not have responded to all of your questions, but I hope you'll keep origin if it seems to help ?B.",Evaldrynn,"Wed,01/08/2020-4:47pm",Thank you,"Hi Bob,Thank you so much for your reply; I think it has helped me a lot, and I'm really glad to hear that my approach might be okay and helpful to him, even if he doesn't think so himself. We called over the phone to talk about some stuff, and regarding what you said about confronting things causing stress, I think that's also why he hates those specific kinds of conversations and would rather not talk about it at all. I read up some more on other's people's posts on here and the replies below them, and also the resources posted on this site. Another thing that's really going to help me out is the 'How to take care of yourself while caring for a loved one with an eating disorder' section in the Toolkit for Parents. It reassured me that talking about my feelings and frustrations to him is okay. 'any caring partner - even in relationships that don't involve matters like this - are going to be asking how the other partner is doing', this is a good reminder for myself too, so thank you. One think that my boyfriend brought up is that he is afraid that I will get tired and that my needs won't be met in our relationship, and though it sometimes feels that way and I sometimes worry about that too, I hope I'll be strong enough to support him all the way through. Do you have any tips for when it becomes too overwhelming? And is there proof that a (positive/loving) relationship can be beneficial for his growth/recovery? I feel like it would help. Or is there evidence that it can make the process harder on him, because it may add to his guilt or shame? He sometimes mentions that he regrets looking for a relationship when he knew he wasn't in a right place, because he feels bad for 'putting me through this' and feels more confronted than ever. Either way I would love to read into the effects a relationship can have on someone with an ED. Thank you for already helping me out so much. E.",BobJ48,"Wed,01/08/2020-5:50pm",Dear E.,"You've brought up some good questions alright.

Some people can put up with the sorts of helplessness they can feel, while it's really too much for others.  Having said that, my feeling is that a person has to come to terms with what they reasonably can expect to do to help the situation.  Sure we would like to be able to somehow ""fix"" the other person, but you probably know what the chances of that happening are.  Still, it's not like we can't do anything.  So getting to a place where we are at some kind of inner peace with what we can and can't do seems to help with the ""overwhelming"" part.   If there *are* some sorts of things that we are allowed to do that seem helpful, I mean.  That part makes a difference too. "" And is there proof that a (positive/loving) relationship can be beneficial for his growth/recovery? I feel like it would help. Or is there evidence that it can make the process harder on him, because it may add to his guilt or shame?  ""Like so many things, the answer to your question is that both of these things may be true.  When you hear stories from people who have recovered, often they will talk about how helpful it was, and what a difference it made to have a caring partner.  Even if during their ED, they treated that partner really poorly.  So yeah, I think we need to have faith that we are helping, even when our partner seems to be giving every sign that we aren't. Can the fact that we care put pressure on the person, in ways that are upsetting to them ?  I think that can be true too.  One of the most common thing that you hear about is how people with EDs often start to pull away from their partners, in response to the care they exhibit. I think a lot of that has to do with…yes, they know that their partner is going to want them to recover, and that they don't have much faith that they can do it.  So yeah, ""caring"" while a good thing, can also end up stirring things up for the person as well. But if a person is going to be a good partner, that pretty much means that they are going to care. It's one of the duties, you know?  Generally people with EDs can understand this, and while it may stir up shame or whatever, hopefully it's a reality that they can tolerate too.Keep writing ?Bob J.",Evaldrynn,"Sat,01/11/2020-4:37pm",New homework,"Hi Bob,Thank you so much for the last reply. I really have to find peace yet with the fact that I can't help a lot or that it won't be visible soon, but I'll be working on it for sure. Yesterday he got new homework, and when I asked him if it was very different from what he had had before, he explained that he has to put the aspects of his life into a pie chart in a way that shows how important things are to him. He continued to say that appearance and weight would be a pacman figure inside that pie chart, and that everything else - work, school, family, friends, me - fit inside the leftover bit inside that pacmans mouth. That hurt me quite deeply, knowing that things like that are more important to him than his family or me, but I reminded myself that it is not how he wants it to be and that he doesn't really have a choice right now. It did make me feel a bit unimportant, and it's giving me all kinds of nasty thoughts I don't want to have. Thoughts like: would it even matter to him if I left, then? Will I be one of the lowest priorities in his life as long as he is recovering from his ED, which could possibly have no end?  But I feel so selfish thinking those kinds of things. I mean yes, I would love to be a higher priority in his life, as he is quite a high priority in mine, but again: I know he can't help it and I know I shouldn't compare him to myself or compare our relationship to other relationships. It just hurts and I don't want it to hurt, and I don't want my pain to hurt him in turn.Another very selfish thought I had was that I wished we could both just be normal, mentally healthy people in a normal, healthy relationship. When I am with him everything feels so right, but when I've not seen him in a few days all kinds of doubts start to creep up on me and I begin to wonder if it isn't better for my own mental health to leave. I am going to see a psychologist in February, however, so I'm really hoping that it helps me stay okay and all that, but I wonder if I can talk about all these things to her since I'm going there for a whole other thing altogether. I also feel like I can't support him in the way he needs me to. Every time I want to listen and offer support that way it brings me to tears hearing what he says, and I feel like that always turns the conversation around to me. I wish I could be strong enough to calmly listen to him telling about his struggles and his rough days.Thank you so much for listening, though. I don't have many other people I can talk to about this, and I sometimes just feel like I'm rambling without knowing what the point is in saying all of this other than just getting it off my chest and having someone listen and respond. I guess it's helping me keep hope, which sometimes feels so, so far away.E.",BobJ48,"Sun,01/12/2020-2:51am",Dear E.,"Hey there E. About his new homework, you wrote :  ""He continued to say that appearance and weight would be a pacman figure inside that pie chart, and that everything else - work, school, family, friends, me - fit inside the leftover bit inside that pacmans mouth.""So here's the thing. When people are really rolling with their EDs, this really is how it can be -Thoughts about weight and appearance start being all they can think about.  It really can be one of the defining symptoms.  Folks kind of allow it to be, because hey, they are trying to drop weight, but as time passes they can begin to become distressed and alarmed when it begins to dawn on them that this really is what fills their head pretty much all of the time.  You really do hear people start to go ""Oh no"" when they realize how much of the rest of their life, and things that they used to enjoy, has been squeezed out of their minds, and displaced by these ED thoughts.  It can be alarming to the point where they truly do start wishing for recovery.So it's possible that the point of this homework is to move him closer to that point, by helping him realize just how much of his mind has been colonized by all of this.  I mean it's possible that at first he'll see this as a reflection of his strength and dedication to losing and looking better, but it's also possible that it's  moving him closer to that ""Uh oh"" moment too.  If I had to guess, I'd say that that's the point of this homework.""When I am with him everything feels so right, but when I've not seen him in a few days all kinds of doubts start to creep up on me and I begin to wonder if it isn't better for my own mental health to leave. ""Yes, you'll have to see how you feel about that, because as much as we love someone, we really do have a duty to look out for our own mental state too.  One other thing to think about is what makes us feel worse, and what makes us feel better.  Our mood and feelings of hopelessness really can take a nosedive if it seems like the person isn't giving us anything positive to support. In contrast, we can feel better and less helpless if they do seem to giving us things to support.  I know this pie-chart doesn't seem to be offering up anything positive to you, but I'd give it some time, and see what effect it has on his outlook.  The down-side can be that once they do realize the sort of trouble they are in, their mood can begin to sink.  And in response to that, their ED symptoms can begin to get worse too.  So be prepared for the worse-before-better possibility.  This really can be one of the stages in this, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the person is moving backwards.  In any case, good on you for getting your appointment in Feb.  I'm not sure what your original reason for going was, but this situation seems pretty important to me, and as you said, being able to keep your feet under you is going to be important, so I think it's perfectly OK to let this be a topic when you see her.And yes, it is good to just vent sometimes, so I hope you'll keep writing if it seem to help.Bob J.",Evaldrynn,"Tue,01/14/2020-11:13am","Hi Bob,","Hi Bob,Thanks once again for the quick reply. Things are going well now, though I won't be able to see him much, but we talked about some of the things that were on my mind and some that were on his. One thing I'm still a bit wary about is the reoccuring painful and heavy cramping in his leg, which is one of the reasons he has difficulty sleeping most nights. I think I saw something like that on the list of symptoms that need medical attention. We already went to his general practitioner about half a year ago for it, but he didn't think it was anything and just gave him some stretching exercises to do before going to bed. My boyfriend's psychologist also knows about the cramps but doesn't think it's anything important either. I guess I don't have to worry about it then? But if it's on your list of symptoms that need medical attention, there's a reason for that, right? Perhaps it's just a coincidence, I don't know. Do you think it's something or?E.",BobJ48,"Tue,01/14/2020-4:45pm",Leg cramping.,"As the old saying goes, none of us here are doctors, and it's unethical to etc etc.Having said that,  yes, people with EDs will often report cramping. Again, don't quote me, but my sense is that it has to do with electrolyte imbalance which is a notorious issue with bulimia.  I'm surprised that the doctor did not recommend some kind of supplement to help deal with this.  People sometimes drink those sports drinks, to keep their potassium levels ( K+ ) up.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but a person's heart is a muscle as well, and a lot of the mortality from bulimia stems from heart issues.If it were me, I'd want to see him get some blood tests - testing for electrolyte levels is really common for people with bulimia.   If a person's K+ levels are low, often they'll get an IV drip to help bring their levels back up, to where hopefully they can be maintained by supplements. Again, I'm not a doctor, but this is the procedure that you hear about a lot of  people having to go through.  At the least, he should be having his blood levels checked, a harmless procedure that pretty much anyone with knowledge of EDs would recoment.",Evaldrynn,"Wed,02/05/2020-6:13am",Hi again,"It's been a while and things have been going well! He's been getting ill quite often recently and I guess it's because of his lowered resistance against viruses and such, but it's always gone within a week so I'm not too worried. He's postponing getting his blood tested since he doesn't like the idea but I'll gently remind him to make an appointment every now and then.The only thing that bothers me a little is something he said a while ago:
""I'm just not in the right situation to work on really getting better right now. I try but it doesn't work; once we live together I won't get the chance to binge so that will help me get rid of it much quicker."" I don't really think it's a good reason, it sounds more like an excuse and I wonder if there will ever be a good time to battle his bulimia. It also feels like quite the responsibility to me, since only me being home in that situation will keep him from binging,but I'm sure I can't always be home even when we live together.
I haven't had the courage to tell him about my doubts yet but I really want to ask him to keep trying. I could use a second perspective, though. Is there logic to his reason and does it really work like that - that if you dont get the chance to binge, it will get better much more easily? Or is it an excuse to not try as hard? Thanks in advance,E.",BobJ48,"Thu,02/06/2020-3:57am",Dear E.,"Good to hear from you again.  ""I'm just not in the right situation to work on really getting better right now. ""
Really, people with EDs do say this a lot, so it really is a pretty common sentiment.  On the one hand they wish they were better, but for whatever reason it doesn't feel like the right emotional time for them to work at it.  Which could be from stress (EDs are a coping method) of some sort, or some other current emotional issue. ""..once we live together I won't get the chance to binge so that will help me get rid of it much quicker.""One thing about this statement : It's not often you hear people with EDs be optimistic like this.  Instead they'll often fret and worry about how things are going to work out for them once they move in with their partner. Mostly about how they'll be able to hide their behaviors and such, So the idea that he sees some ED-related positives to the two of you being together…that's not always what you hear from people in this sort of situation.  It's possible that he'll still have just the same problems of course, but the fact that he was able to put it this way - in a way that includes you -  is notable."" Is there logic to his reason and does it really work like that - that if you dont get the chance to binge, it will get better much more easily? Or is it an excuse to not try as hard? ""It could be an excuse I suppose - putting things off until some set of circumstances that hasn't happened yet.  Like you said, sometimes the ""right time"" is never ever right now.  But he could also be earnest about this.  If you read about what makes people finally want to stop, the answers are all over the place.  But sometimes people will mention how having a partner has helped them. Like how they don't want to be a disappointment to them.  Sure, it would be great if they simply wanted to recover for themselves, but it can also be a ""whatever works"" thing, when it comes to the idea of motivation."" It also feels like quite the responsibility to me…""
Yep, I can totally understand that.  So one thing that might help when the time comes, is to ask him to be specific about the ways that he hopes you can help him.  ""Just…everything' - like you said, that's too vague for anyone to be comfortable with. So encourage him to be specific, not just about you, but what he sees as his responsibilities too.   With the addendum that he also gets to mess up now and then.Anyhow, just some thoughts.   I hope things are going OK for you guys otherwise, because the ""otherwise"" is important too.",Evaldrynn,"Fri,02/07/2020-6:26pm",Strange feeling of dread,"Hi Bob! Thank you for your reply. The otherwise is definitely going okay and we're having lots of good times together! And it's good to hear that the hope he has for the future is a positive sign, I'm really glad he thinks that way then. I mentioned my doubts on the 'not the right time to change/fight' argument and he told me he's definitely still very much trying right now, so that was also a relief. He did mention another thing though, but I'm not sure if it could be related to his bulimia. Most nights he keeps waking up with an intense feeling of dread, like something bad is going to happen. I know you're not a doctor,but I wonder if it's a common symptom or not. He's definitely having trouble sleeping at night, whereas during the day he could lie down at any given moment and sleep.

""No kidding, that is a good sign.  People with EDs often find it very difficult to keep fighting, or to maintain any sort of optimism regarding recovery, so the fact that he's still working at that really does count as a positive sign.

Most nights he keeps waking up with an intense feeling of dread, like something bad is going to happen...I wonder if it's a common symptom or not.""I'm not sure that it's a common symptom, but we can all be prey to free-floating anxiety sometimes.  Like we may not consciously know what exactly the issue is…but at the same time, part of our brain seems to know.And really, it could have to do with ED stuff.  Because even in recovery, people still can be plagued with urges, and the sorts of doubts and premonitions as to what that might mean.  Like what if his efforts amount to nothing ?  His marriage could go to hell, and he could be stuck alone in this ED place forever.  There's no way to really tell and…well…I'm sure you know how things like that can go. There's no real way tell what the outcome could be, so our worries start running away with us.  So I think it's fair to say things like this to him - "" I know you still worry about what the future might bring.""

Things have been going really well despite his trouble sleeping, and I think I'm noticing a growth in his confidence regarding his body and showing it to me without even thinking much about it. Sometimes I wonder if it's only on days where he hasn't eaten much and has excercised a lot but I haven't been able to confirm it, so for now I'm going to assume it's good progress! I also wonder at times if I should compliment his body at all? On some forum posts I've read that it might help him feel better about his body, on other forum posts people mentioned it might convince him that he needs to stay as thin as he already is and keep worrying about his weight. I have told him my love for him definitely wouldn't change if he gained weight, only that him losing weight will make me worry more - and he seems to accept my compliments, so I guess it's not that big of a deal. Of course I also compliment him on lots and lots of other stuff and not just his body, so I'm hoping that it helps him get more confidence too. He""s always so hard on himself when it comes to performing at university though... Even when he gets 70 - 80% on assignments he mentions his group members must've done the most, or his professor must have low standards. Even when he gets great marks on exams he doesn't believe it's because of his own intelligence and perserverance. I really hope that sentiment falls away when he graduates, but I can see how it could affect him in a job too. He doesn't accept my compliments about his intelligence fully yet either, it feel like. But! It used to be worse. He used to come home and bang his head against a wall saying how he was an idiot and all that, so I'm glad he's come so far already.So yeah, I'm glad it has been going so well!

This seems to be a universal issue with pretty much everyone who has eating disorders. You name the area of endeavor, and they are just not good enough…yet, that is.  But perhaps some time in the future, if they only keep pushing forward with ( insert ED behavior here ).   And hopefully in ways that are clearly measurable in numbers, or some other black and white way of assessing things.So yeah, moving into an emotional area where one can assess themselves in a more gentle and spiritual ( <—or whatever your preferred term is here ) way really does count as progress I think.

People with EDs really can become fixated on then nature of their bodies as their primary means of personal assessment, so I'm not a fan of anything which might seem to support or encourage that.  Plus, if the person is really deep into their ED, there's nothing you can say that's going to help.  If you say they've gained weight and look better, what you really mean is that they look fat.  If you say they look thinner, you are just saying that to try and make them feel better, when what you really mean is that you think they look fat.  Perhaps he's no longer that way with such sorts of comments, but even so, I'd steer away from body related comments if it were me.   You probably know for you own self how easily problematic such comments can be.But yes, any signs of healthy internal self esteem that doesn't seem to primarily rely on numbers…that really is wonderful to hear about, and it does sound like you are starting to hear a little of that.  :-)Bob J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,Rose1022,12-12-19,A developing problem for my boyfriend ,"Hello everyone. Firstly let me say that I’m so glad I found this forum because at the moment I just have no idea what to do. My boyfriend and I are both 24 and have been together for almost four years now. We have had our fair share of hardships as my boyfriend has several mental health disorders including bipolar, anxiety, and depression. He is a self conscious person, but up until now he’s had no history of any obvious eating disorders. His sister had a very serious ed when he was a child and it affected him significantly. About 9 or so months ago he developed a stomach ulcer and was getting sick consistently every morning because of it for several weeks. He went to the doctor and got it treated, but never stopped getting sick. He has a therapist and they toyed with the idea of him being so used to getting sick at this point that it is in his head. I believe this is very likely but lately it has taken a more sinister turn. I no longer believe this is a reflexive issue, I think it has turned into an intentional act.My boyfriend is a relatively compliant patient when it comes to treating his mental health, but his attitude with this new problem is unlike I’ve ever seen him. The first time I brought it up, I approached it very gently, like I always do when handling these kinds of issues, but he turned very defensive and agitated. He very adamantly insistent “It’s not a problem” over and over while attempting to justify his actions. I pressed it slightly, but dropped it for the night. I brought it up again recently and he was just as cold and unyielding. Despite seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist I feel confident enough in saying that this is something he has not told either of them. His relationship with food is a tricky one as it has changed a few times throughout our relationship. Before his ulcer he had a tendency to over eat, but he would sometimes say that he hates the concept of having to eat. During his ulcer he lost a lot of weight and expressed often how much he hated food and hated getting sick. Now, he says nothing negative about food. Sometimes he will over eat and other times he will not. But he does, and always has, snacked a lot at night after dinner. He gets sick just about every morning. He is so non compliant with this I just don’t know what to do. He has an addictive personality and I know I really need to do something about this before it spirals into something even worse. Thank you for taking the time to read. I could really use a bit of guidance.",BobJ48,"Sat,12/14/2019-7:12pm",Rose,"Dear Rose,Yes, it's hard to know what the story really is with this.  Is it an eating disorder, or what ?   It might be, I suppose, particularly if he's mentioned issues with his weight in the past.It's also possible that this stomach issue is emotionally unsettling for him.  It would be for me, I know.  So his throwing up might be one of those "" OK, let's get this out of the way"" sorts of things ?   Where he throws up on purpose, rather than waiting until things get so bad that  he dosen't have a choice but to do it ?    Which might be a thing that makes him feel as though he has some bits of control over the issue ?Who knows what the situation with his meds might be, because I suspect that the doctors may have prescribed some antibiotics for his ulcer ?  Sometimes those can make a person feel nauseous too ?My sense is that you may have to give this situation a little more time, before you really know what the story is, because if he is legitimately in pain, and really is still nauseous with some regularity, I can see where it might still be hard to pin down exactly what's going on.",PaulShipmanSmith,"Wed,01/15/2020-6:13pm",Reply,"The therapists may have been a little too blunt by saying that the sickness is just 'in his head' and could have worded it more sensitively.  However.  It is not unusual for many of us to experience this fear after a bout of illness, especially when it involves being sick or having diarrhoea.
   Your boyfriend does appear to be at  risk of developing an eating disorder but it's finding out all the facts without him feeling pressured.
  Although you fear that he is developing an eating disorder, try using the ulcer as a starting point in your investigation.
  Approaching the subject with him about the ulcer may be a little less confrontational than discussing his possible eating disorder.  That you can move on to later.
 For a start.  Your boyfriend has already been treated for this ulcer.  However.  He could still be experiencing some trouble with it.  He may need to go back to the doctor and have it checked out.
  People often don't want to talk about health problems and admit to being in pain.  Your boyfriend could be trying to hide this from you.
  He may not be discussing issues with the therapists for various reasons.  One reason could be that he feels uncomfortable talking with them about his physical problems.
  The counsellor/client relationship does not always work.  Sometimes, two people 'get on' straight away.  Other times they don't and communication can be less effective.
  You could sit with him for a start and gently approach the conversation about his sickness and try to encourage him to see the doctor.  He could be experiencing a deep impact from the ulcer - which can sometimes follow on with the patient becoming over-preoccupied with their health.
  On the subject of his eating and general health, it might be worth investigating his diet.  What your boyfriend ate before, during and after the ulcer episode could actually have played a part in his illness.
  You mention that he 'snacked' a lot and still does.  Yes.  As hard as it may be to accept.  Snacking can cause poorly tummies.  A change may be needed in that area.
  Many people find it difficult to accept and deal with the fact that what they are consuming is making them ill.
  In fairness.  Many people are unaware that what they are eating is making them ill.
  Your boyfriend may be suffering an allergic reaction to certain foods and is unaware of this.  He could be aware that certain foods - the stuff he likes most - may be making him ill yet he is unwilling to face and accept this.
  Due to your boyfriend's various issues with mental health, his eating habits will have - and still be - affected by his situation.  It is not unusual for people with mental health issues to experience difficulties with regard to their diet or eating habits.
  Some people will be very 'picky' eaters.   Some will only eat at a certain time, from a particular style of plate or want the food in a certain order or position.  Then there are those who will only eat if the food is prepared in a certain way.
  Some people will eat 'out of character' when experiencing the emotional highs and lows of their mental health journey.  When depressed - for example - some people will overeat or 'comfort eat' .  However.  Some people will not eat all day.
  There are those that will not eat amongst other people, so will avoid food until they are alone.
  Then you get those that will criticise when others are enjoying their food, in the hope of causing a 'guilt trip'.  The list can go on........
  Guilt can  be associated with eating and meal times, especially if someone is experiencing the anxiety, depression and negative feelings involved in struggling with their psychological well-being.
  These are areas worth exploring.
  You could explain that you are worried about his health and you may both benefit by seeing  the doctor as a couple.
  You may also want to look into couples counselling in order help encourage him to explore the possibility of a developing eating disorder.  Should this be the case, you'll be more informed and prepared to deal with this together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,nedahelpa,08-08-19,Naked vs Dressed,"Hello to all.My wife, 52 years young, started on a diet about a year ago, besides that, daily yoga or running or calisthenics, she lost weight and started to look VERY good. However, it got to a point where that was most of what she talked about to anyone who was willing to listen. Daily she was reading more articles on the internet about healthy living, diets, preservatives, tea, etc.She had gone to a nutritionist a year ago and was aiming to improve those numbers. It got to a point where a routine blood test showed Bilirubin in her blood so I
thought she was overdoing it; she decided to go back to the nutritionist and when she came back she waved the results in my face, like a flag of accomplishment. This emboldened her so she continued the Dr. mentioned that a second test showed no bilirubin.HERE IS MY PROBLEM:
  Neither the nutritionist nor her friends that say she looks great have seen her naked. From being slightly overweight..passing through VERY SEXY...now what I see worries me.Sorry for being so blunt!
This change happened in 3 months.We are having problems because I can no longer see her body because it constantly reminds me of that image.
Sex is gone and she noticed it, she is demanding I continue as if nothing changed, she says it's still her. Any ideas on how to deal with this would be appreciated.

Daily she was reading more articles on the internet about healthy living, diets, preservatives, tea, etc. ""Yep, that sort of obsessiveness doesn't bode well, and is something that many people with EDs find themselves dealing with.  In the beginning it can feel like a healthy and positive thing to them.  They're finally taking control of their life !!You've seen what it can turn into though.  The ""control"" part I mean.  The scale goes down and they're in control, the scale goes up and they're a failure. Life is more complicated than that of course, but for some people their way of thinking really does begin to narrow down to that sort of black and white way of assessing things. It's a classic symptom it seems.  One would think that once they reach a certain goal weight then they'd be fine.  But seeing the scale NOT go down can begin to seem almost as big of a failure as seeing it go up. So it's kind of like an addiction.  Where people are not so much addicted to being thin, but rather they've become addicted to the PROCESS of becoming thin.  Anything other than getting thinner is mentally the same as not being in control.  And really, who's comfortable with not being in control of their lives ?  Not me, and probably not you either, so you can kind of understand the sort of mental dynamics that are at work here. Plus isn't it good to be ""healthy"" ?  It's hard to tell you what to do in this situation.  It will take her gaining some perspective.  What often happens is that the person slowly becomes aware that food and numbers and exercise is ALL that they can think about anymore.  There's no room for friends or hobbies or much of anything else anymore.  And that perhaps rather than being in control, they are out of control instead.  That they are being controlled, rather than having control.   That's usually where the turning point comes. ""OK, I'll just go back to eating again.""   Un uh.  They discover that they can't just go back to eating again. This is often when people begin to think of recovery, or are able to label their situation a problem.  They can often begin to suffer from depression as well. So yes, how can you move the situation along.  Is she still telling herself that ""everything's fine"" ?  Is she trying to tell you that too ?Except everything isn't fine.  Her husband is freaking out, the sex life is no good anymore - those are things that are definitely not fine. Maybe she'll say ""Oh that's your problem"".  But if it's effecting the relationship then it's her problem too. So one suggestion might be marriage counseling.  She could say that the doesn't want to go, but if it's about the marriage and the two of you, how could she reasonably not take part ?  Maybe you are the problem, but if that is the case, then she needs to go in order to point that out to the counsellor. In any case, just some thoughts.  Getting to the point where she actually sees the situation as a problem herself is what it's going to take I think.  She may already be having suspicions that it might be, you know ?

In fact, no mental illness/addiction is a quick fix and it is not something we can ""fix"" for someone else.  They have (1) recognize the problem, (2) see it as a problem, (3) want to get better, and (4) be willing to put in the very hard work it takes to get better.  What we can do is focus on ourselves, and on our reactions to their illness and behaviors.  We need to look deeply into ourselves to make sure that we stay mentally healthy through this.  It takes a detachment that is hard to achieve.  It takes forming boundaries.  It means we have to allow them to have their own experiences so that they can learn to rescue themselves from their own behaviors.  The longer we shield them, the worse it will get.  If they can rescue themselves from their actions, we allow them to experience the joy and pride that results from that achievement and that would have motivated them to make further attempts at getting better.  Does that make sense?It also means we do not participate in their illness.  We do not talk to ""ED"".  We do not hold conversations with ED about weight, or calories, or body image.  We can be blunt about this. We can say we will not talk to your illness and we can change the subject.You can inform her doctors that she is restricting her eating to an unhealthy level and you can let them try to help her.  But you are not her doctor and you don't have answers for her.  It know that you wish that you did and it would be so much easier if you did.I have looked around for an Eating Disorder group that I could attend, but I haven't found one.  The best I have found is Al-anon which has a 12-step program to help people deal with alcoholics in their lives.  A person with ED is not so very different from an alcoholic.  Both are suffering from a mental illness. Both are dealing with addictive behaviors.  Both are trying to self-medicate a need albeit using different methods.You might want to look into Al-anon for help in navigating these waters.  You might also want to look into therapy for yourself so that you have someone to help you understand the situation and to whom you can talk honestly.Sending best wishes.",vlostwalt,"Wed,08/21/2019-5:47pm",..,"....

7,Trying2Help247,12-10-19,How Can I Help?!,"My wife and I have been together for almost 9 years and when I met her, she was struggling with anorexia and depression. She would go days without eating, sometimes only having a bite to eat here and there to get her through the days. She was eventually hospitalized and put in a facility for Eating Disorders for a couple days.  She continued to struggle after being released and had to go to group meetings where they all ate together and she was weighed to make sure she wasn't losing any more weight.  This was all 9 years ago.  I know she has struggled with a negative self image over the last 9 years and has told me she's has fallen back in to old habits, but I always thought it was still under control.  It wasn't until this past weekend that she admitted to me that she has been skipping meals a lot and lying to me about what she eats for lunch at work.  I have no way of knowing what she does at work so I didn't see a pattern forming again.  When I asked how long she has been skipping meals her response was ""since before our wedding"" which happened 5+ months ago. She also told me she didn't tell me because she ""didn't want me to be disappointed in her"". I could never be disappointed in her for going through something she has struggled with for almost a decade.  I am more sad that she was hiding it from me all this time when I have been her biggest supporter since the day I met her.  I just don't know how to help her.  She isn't to the point where she needs to be hospitalized again, but there is always the chance it could get worse again.  I suggested we prep meals together for the week so she has food options in the fridge and doesn't have to worry about ordering food from the cafe.  I also told her that I am going to ask her every day what she ate for lunch, not to annoy her, but almost be a reminder that she needs to eat.  I also tried to explain that her restricting her body of food and proper nutrition won't help her lose weight, because her body will go in to starvation mode since it doesn't know when it's next meal will come.  I just feel like I'm not giving the correct advice or saying the right things.  I am not a professional and don't have the knowledge to be there properly for her.  I am trying to find a therapist for her to talk to who specializes in this but in the mean time, how can I help her?",BobJ48,"Wed,12/11/2019-2:30pm",How to help her...,"Hey there.Yes, situations like these are not the sort of situations that we are used to !  In most situations there is ""something we can do"" that's of a substantial nature, and where we can see some material results afterwards.  We have a certain amount of control over the situation, I mean.  So yes, situations like these are not like that at all, and I suspect I don't have to tell you how that can feel.The thing with eating disorders is that the person really does need to see them as a problem and a negative thing.  This needs to be their own personal feeling about it, and can't be something that we are somehow able to convince them about.  And even if she thinks that it's a negative thing, that still doesn't mean that she'll be able to just turn off  the influence that these old feelings and urges exert over here.  It's almost as though the person is suffering under the influence of some sort of evil spell. Plus it's likely that she already understands the effects of starvation.  Most people with EDs have a pretty good idea as to what the story with eating disorders is.  On an objective basis that is. So I guess I would ask you what she thinks the solution might be ?   Does she have any suggestions as to how she thinks you might help her ? Or what she thinks might help her besides your support ?Being asked to just ignore the situation is unlikely to result in anything positive I'm afraid.  The Elephant in the Room, and all that.  So it's something the two of you are likely going to have to deal with sooner or later.  For her, probably, because hiding all this will have a mental influence on her,  but just as much for how it's going to make you feel too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,Doingmybest,12-04-19,Looking for guidance on how to help my boyfriend,"Hi everyone. I have been with my 24 year old boyfriend for about two years now, and last year I learned he struggles with bulimia. He was bullied in middle school and missed months of class because he was sick but his parents and doctors never figured out it was bulimia (I understand that many people wrongly believe it to be a condition only women suffer from). He told me this and for a long time we struggled because he has really hard times where he still feels the symptoms of his ED and even acts on them occasionally. I finally was able to get through to him about therapy, and now he sees an Therapist with specialty in dealing with EDs and he loves her. I know it’s helping him a lot. However, I still have questions about how I can support him and help him through this hardship. He shares with me a lot of times that he feels unhappy with his weight or insecure about meeting new people because he’s gained a certain amount. I honestly and so truthfully don’t care at all what his weight is, I just want him to be happy. What should I say when he tells me these things? It really consumes him sometimes and I know he’s opening up by telling me but I always feel at a loss for words. I feel like if I say “no you’re so handsome!” That’s encouraging his obsessing on what he looks like, but that if I say “that’s not what matters, I care about you not what you look like” that I’m conceding I have noticed he’s gained weight even if I haven’t. I just want to say the right thing in these situations that won’t make him feel worse and might even help. Another thing is exercise. My boyfriend used to be overweight before I knew him, but I guess a few years back he started going to the gym a lot and lost a bunch of weight, which made him feel a lot more secure in himself. However, when he stops going to the gym (he’s a busy person with a hectic job) he gets really down on himself and thinks he looks “fat” even though he’s not. The same thing happens when he orders delivery or eats unhealthy for a week or something. Sometimes he says “Help me remember to eat healthy this week” or “will you please make sure I don’t get lazy and not go to the gym tomorrow?” And I’m not sure what to do in those scenarios either. When he does things like go to the gym regularly and eat healthy he’s so happy and confident and feeling good about himself and everything else, so a part of me would like to encourage it mildly, and help him do the things that make him feel confident. Would this be feeding bad behavior? It’s so hard to know because going to the gym and eating healthy are good, normal things to do, but at the same time I don’t want to ever ever encourage unhealthy behavior that could only make his ED worse. Sorry this was so long, but these questions have been building up for a long time. I really appreciate it if you’ve read this far.",BobJ48,"Fri,12/06/2019-7:28pm",Doing My Best .,"Hey there DMB,
I Hope you end up seeing this. Posts can sit here for a while sometimes. But I do hope you see this First off, good for your BF getting himself to therapy. While we want to help, we are their partners and not their therapists, and our job is to support our partners and not to ""fix"" them.  Which it sounds like you've already figured out. It's good that you guys are able to talk too. That sort of communication is going to give you both an advantage when it comes to supporting him.  One thing to keep in mind when you see him getting anxious is that EDs are about control.  He emotionally feels not quite as in control of things, so he goes to the gym. Working out helps him feel more in control.""Feeling fat"" is kind of the same thing.  Feeling fat is code-talk feeling out of control..;Once you get the control thing figured out, and see the sorts of formats in which it gets played out ( restriction, purging, excercize and etc) ;you can kind of see how people get EDs in the first place. ;Because who likes feeling like they are out of control ?  No one. So how do people with EDs address that?  Through various behaviors that can provide some sense of control, but which don't really get at the heart of the matter Then there's the ""good enough"" thing.  Are we good enough yet ?  This can get played out in the arena of food and excersise too. When really it's an emotional thing.  The problem with that, as far as we are concerned,, is that we can't reelly tell them that we think that they are ""enough"" - That needs to be something that they belive themselves But we can commiserate with them about the control issue in general. And let them know that we understand that a lot of their naxiety is related to that. Rather than ""you don't really need to go to the gym so much"" or comments like that.In any case, you are right about the need to feel like we are crafting our responses in helpful ways.  If the person feels like someone else ""gets it"" they can feel less alone with their concerns, and that in itself can feel suppsotive to them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,FSW91,11/28/2019,What am I supposed to do/say?,"My wife went through treatment for an eating disorder and on most days is doing well. She follows the recommended meal plan that was taught to her in treatment, but of course has better/worse days with it. I'm struggling to find information on the best thing to do in certain situations. For example, on bad days when she asks if I think she's gained weight, I've opted to gently refuse to answer the question. I usually say it's not helpful or important, and that I love her and am attracted to her. I have no idea if it's helpful that I refuse to answer- I just figure it's wrong to entertain her preoccupation with it and justify it by answering as if it's okay to be concerned about it (for most people of course it is okay to notice/get concerned but for her/others it's a slippery slope). Another situation is when she's having a bad day with it and she's saying she's anxious about good- I have no idea what to say or do. Do I lovingly push her to eat normally? How hard do I push it? If she wants to go for a run before an anticipated big meal, is that okay because it's not completely outside the norm of what people might generally do, or is that heading down that slippery slope? I guess I'm struggling with which coping mechanisms to support or let go, and which to fight. Any advice is appreciated.",BobJ48,"Mon,12/02/2019-11:46am", Helpful Comments.,"Hey FSW,To be honest, I think that your on the right track with your comments.  As you have noticed, old ED concerns and ways of thinking die hard, and will try and intrude themselves while people are working at recovery. While I think it's only being realistic to acknowledge this, it's good to not allow yourself to get sucked into going along with it. But to do that in a caring and sensitive way. As you've seen, left over ED thinking will try and lure you into making appearance-type comments. Depending on the mood of the moment, you can take a more or less light-hearted approach to your answers. Which sounds like what you are doing, so good for you !When it comes to anxiety about food, it's probably OK to commiserate with her about that. Because frankly, it's not unrealistic that she's going to be anxious.  It's going to feel risky to her to take chances with eating sometimes, and I think it's OK to let her know that you understand those feelings, and how recovery is going to involve taking risks with food.  Because recovery really is like that - Daring to take both food and emotionally related steps that ED is going to be telling them that they should not take.  There really are risks that she'll need to be taking, and my sense is that it's OK to be open about that in a caring way. When it comes to coping mechanisms , one of the things about EDs is that people often respond with actions ( like going for a run, or out and out restriction or purging) when it would be better for their recovery if they were responding with words and emotions instead.  As you may have noticed, exercise is not necessarily a bad thing for any of us. Sometimes it can be a healthy way to deal with stress.  But if the person finds themselves using it as a response to fears about weight-gain, when they probably should be experimenting with trying to talk those fears out instead. As you are noticing, recovery presents the person with a lot of challenges.  They are constantly asking themselves to do things which are a direct challenge to their old ways of thinking.  Taking chances which really can feel wrong to them.  This sort of anxiety and ambivalence is pretty normal I think, and if you show that you understand that, it really can feel supportive I think.( I saw that it seems to have taken a few days for your post to show up here.  Not sure why that was, but I hope you won't let that discourage you from continuing to write )Bob J.",Doingmybest,"Wed,12/04/2019-12:53am",Adding on with my own questions,"Hi, sorry to hijack this thread but I'm having a hard time posting my own for some reason and my concerns are very similar.I've been with my 24 year old boyfriend for about 2 years and last year he opened up to me that he had been severely bullied in middle school for his weight which resulted in him developming serious bulimia. At that time he missed several months of school and his doctors and parents still don't know that it was because of bulimia-- they thought he was just... sick. I understand that many people unfortunately didn't and still don't understand that these struggles effect both genders.He's an incredible person and I just want to help him more than anything, and finally was able to convince him to see a therapist for the first time in his life. I know it has been heloing him a lot (she's an ED specialist) and it has definitely been a great relief for us both. However, he definitely still struggles and sometimes he just shuts down and acts really down on himself. When I ask him why he just shuts down. Sometimes he tells me its because he thinks he's ""fat"" or because he's gained weight. I don't know what to do or say when he says this. If I say ""I really don't think you have! You are so handsome"" I worry I'm encouraging his thoughts about his appearance, but if I say something like ""I don't care about your weight, I love you for who you are"" I feel like he might think I'm conceding that I think he looks like he's gained weight or something. I usually just say some jumbled mix of the two, and it feels like I've done nothing to help. I honestly don't care how much he weighs, I just want him to be happy, and I want to say the right thing. I love him.Another thing I worry about is how to respond to his exercise habits. Before I knew him, he was overweight and went through a really bad time with drugs and depression. About a year before I met him he stopped using drugs, got an awesome job, moved out of his parents' house, and lost a lot of weight. I think a big part of how happy he became during that time had to do with his self-confidence surrounding his weight, and I don't think (although I guess who can say for sure) bulimia was the cause of this weight loss. I think it was going to the gym. It makes him feel really good and confident to go to the gym and eat healthy. Should I encourage those behaviors for those reasons? It's normal and healthy to regularly go to the gym and to eat healthy foods, but I don't want to encourage behavior that might make him obsess over his weight. The problem is, when he doesn't go to eh gym and eat healthy he gets really depressed. Sometimes, he'll even say ""Okay, I'm really going to get back on the gym grind, don't let me miss tomorrow because then I'll spiral."" It's true... he does spiral when he loses that healthy eating and exercising routine. Should I help him stay on it as a normal healthy habit to encourage, or is that wrong? It is so hard to know.Anyway, so sorry FSW91 for adding to your thread, and sorry this was so long. It has been building up for  along time. I really appreciate it if any of you have read this far.-Kate L",MMTF98,"Wed,12/04/2019-9:13am","Hi FSW,","Hi FSW,I am sorry you are dealing with this. Since April of this year, I have also been trying to help my wife recover from anorexia.  It has been terrible, frustrating, and sad.  It has also been a big learning and growing experience for me.  I am slowly learning that the best help isn't the direct help, problem-solving, or the planning and worrying that I did.  The best help for my wife is indirect – listening with compassion when she opens up, detaching with love, and living my values in what I say and do in the present moment.  I recently read ""Don't Feed the Monkey Mind"" (about Anxiety) and ""The 8 Keys to Recovery"" (about ED) and both books have been helpful in understanding what is going on with my wife and what I am doing that isn't helping her or me.  I am currently reading ""Codependent No More,"" which is largely written for loved ones of alcoholics or addicts, but also applies to ED.   I am not done the book yet, but the concept of ""detach with love"" makes a lot of sense as it is beneficial for me while also empowering my wife to make her own choices for health.  I have seen a therapist with experience in treating ED for several months now and I find that helpful too.As you and Bob suggested, I think you are doing the right thing by not taking to your wife about weight or looks.  She already values these concepts too much as part of her identity.  I would also recommend you make sure her friends and extended family also don't talk about looks to her because even something seemingly benign like ""Oh you look great"" can be misinterpreted by the ED as ""that means I got fat"".  And again ""Oh you look great"" reemphasizes the importance of looks over the substance of who your wife really is.  The run stuff is also concerning for anyone with ED as it is a safety strategy that only serves to reinforce the importance of looks, weight or being skinny (i.e. – I am anxious about eating so go for a run [to burn calories] and then I won't feel as bad about eating.  This simply reinforces the idea that keeping net calories down is the important thing).  Like Bob said, you hope your wife won’t avoid the anxiety (with the run or other safety strategy) but talk about the underlying emotions and thoughts to process them and eat anyway.  This is what she did in treatment, and what she has to continue to do to keep moving towards recovery.From someone who is currently right in the thick of these struggles, I understand how sad, frustrating, and confusing it can be.  Recovery isn't linear, motivations change, and life can and will throw you plenty of curveballs.  With that said, I think there is wisdom in what Carolyn Costin says in The 8 Keys "". . .the only people who don't recover are the ones who stop trying."" As along as your wife is trying, recognize that as a positive and try to find ways to empower her to make small changes that set her up for accomplishment and a sense of control apart from the ED.Best,

10,dittoditto,11/29/2019,Happy Thanksgiving BobJ48,I hope you had a wonderful thanksgiving.  Thank you for always being here for us.May I ask what got you involved with EDs?,BobJ48,"Sat,11/30/2019-3:50pm",Ditto,"I had a friend with EDs who passed away after we knew each other for several years.  While she was still alive, I asked for some help on Something Fishy, which was the big ED board at the time.   The person who answered my post had EDs herself, and she and I ended up emailing back and forth for a year or so.  Then she started a recovery group on Yahoo Groups and asked me to be on it.  So instead of just talking with her, suddenly I was  right in the middle of the ED community, talking with a whole bunch of other people too.  After doing that for several years, I went back to Something Fishy,and was the mod on their Partners and Spouses forum, where I tried to help partners ""get it"" about what was going on with the people they cared about. Because if partners understand, I think it helps the person with the ED too.  But I've continued to work on forums for people with EDs since the beginning,  and have been a member of the current big evil one since it first started.  Oddly, a bunch of us from the original Yahoo forum I was on are still friends.  They were in their late teens or a bit older back then, and are close to 40 right now ( and doing better) and we still all stay in touch in a regular way.

11,MMTF98,11/24/2019,help getting wife back into treatment,"I met my wife 15 years ago and found out on our first date that she had an ED a few years prior in college, but she was recovered.  Throughout our dating and marriage she always cared about what she ate and how she looked, but it was never her focus, she was present with me and in our life, and became a great stay at home mom to our three kids.  The last few years things started to change as the kids got older and were more independent at school.  I thought she lacked purpose and tried to encourage her to develop more interests, get a job, or set personal goals she could feel good about accomplishing. What I didn’t realize was her ED was only ever in partial remission and late last year it came back.So far this year she has been in In-Patient (IP), Residential, Partial and Out-Patient (OP) care. She felt forced into IP and RES by me, family and friends, and her OP team.  She fought against IP everyday and it took her a week to finally accept RES treatment, where she did make some psychological and physical progress for several difficult weeks.  Being away from our kids was so tough for her and dealing with the frustrations of RES and the guilt of abandoning our kids was too much for her.  It pushed her out of RES before she had made enough physical and psychological progress.  She quickly regressed in day and eventually insurance said “no more, go back to RES.”  She adamantly said “No” and I gave her the chance to do it OP with her team.  Again she made progress but only limited and her ED self seems to get stronger each time we go around (eat for few days and be present, then feel very guilty and restrict).  Her treatment team has now drawn a line in the sand and I know I have to do the same – basically saying she has to move out because she is putting the disease in front of herself, me and the kids.  I have talked to my therapist about how to do it and I have plenty of family and friend support – all on the side of her committing to getting healthy regardless of what it takes.I am looking for advice from others who have been through this.  If we force her into treatment and she still doesn’t buy in, where does that get us?  If I do nothing and she continues to muddle through and the ED continues to get stronger, her health will fail and I and the kids will have to watch her slowly die.  I feel like I am dealing with an addict and I don’t know what rock bottom is going to have to look like and if she will make it back.",BobJ48,"Sun,11/24/2019-4:03pm",Committed to treatment.,"MMTF,Oh brother, I'm so sorry to hear this.  It has to be a source of frustration and upset for all who are involved, including your wife. And yes, as you've seen, this sort of thing really can etch itself into a person's brain, particularly if they fall under it's spell when they are young, and their brains are still forming. How one approaches it now is difficult to say.  For the last few years . I've been talking with a person who has horrific problems with self-injury. If you saw the things she does, you'd freak-out too.  Which is what all of her ""helpers"" are doing. And the more they freak out, and try and impose their will upon her, the more it creates the very sort of stress that causes her to self-injure.  I got a note from her today, and she mentioned that as a result of certain circumstances,  now that she's having a break from the demands of all of these ""helpers"" her urges to self-injure have almost disappeared..   So there you go I guess.   Sometimes all of the external pressures to ""get better"" only serve to produce the exact opposite results that everyone is hoping to accomplish. And I'll be if you asked her about this, she might agree.This all may get down to the ""control"" thing.  Folks with EDs will often tell you that EDs are about having control.  So when others try and remove that control, and exert their own control on the person, you can kind of understand why their minds might rebel.On the other hand, what are people expected to do ? Just sit back and do nothing ?  That's an unreasonable expectation too.This may seem like an obvious question, but to what degree are people asking her what she thinks would be the best course of action ?  Sorry, but answers like ""I'll just kill myself""….Hopefully she'll understand that that's not a very practical answer.  So hopefully when asked, she'd be able to take a more reasonable look at her situation, and come up with some suggestions that do involve her being willing to take some risks with this, rather than thinking that just going back to the same old set of behaviors is going to solve anything. So the ""being willing to take some risks"" may be a theme that's worth trying.Most people with EDs are not particularly happy that they have them, so thats' something to keep in mind as well, even if they often see them as their only method to cope and feel in control during times of stress. As you said, everyone is interested in seeing her commit to recovery, but what everyone else thinks and hopes she will do may also be the sort of  source of stress that keeps her depending on her ED.Remember too, you have a right to want to see things better for yourself and for the children.  That's not an unreasonable wish on your part at all.  While having her move out may sound to her like one more way to try and exert control over her, hopefully you can frame that idea in terms that don't sound punitive or manipulative, as you really do have some emotional rights of your own that are worthy of consideration.In any case, I'd certainly ask her what she sees as the solution.  She may say that she dosn't want to recover, so you may want to say something like ""But if you did want to recover, what might you see as the best way to go about that ?""In any case, just some thoughts.   Keep writing ?Bob J.",MMTF98,"Thu,11/28/2019-11:14am",Thanks Bob,"Thanks Bob.  I appreciate the perspective.  She sees herself ""muddling through"" for the rest of her life, which is no solution at all.  Your idea of taking ""little risks"" might be the kind of thing that she can embrace.  I know she has done work on what things look like 5 years from now if she has recovered and if she has not.  Keeping that in focus when she makes decisions throughout her day seems to be the hard part without additional support from a high level of care (PHP or RES).I just started reading ""Codependent No More"" by Melody Beattie at the recommendation of my therapist and I think it could be helpful.  I would not have thought of myself as codependent but after reading the first 4 chapters, the shoe fits.  ""They have worried themselves sick about other people.  That have tried to help in ways that didn't help. . . .They have tried to make other people see things their way"".  That is me.  I now know that what I have been doing isn't helping and may actually be hurting the situation and bringing about the dire future I fear.  A former colleague of mine is doing a film on PTSD and depression in the military and research found that people with a mantra, a short go to phrase of hope and support, had better recovery outcomes.  He suggested I create one for myself.  I am thinking about borrowing from the character Dalton in the movie Roadhouse - ""Pain Don't Hurt.""   This seems aligned with what I read in the book ""Don't Feed the Monkey Mind"" about anxiety.  Pain + Resistance = Suffering but Anxiety + Acceptance = Resilience.  I see my wife's suffering with ED as avoiding or resisting some pain through the illusion of control provided by the ED.  My suffering is a reaction to resisting the fear, anger, sadness, and frustration that I can't do anything to ensure her recovery.  So I guess I have to learn to accept and live with that pain without employing the safety strategies that reinforce my anxiety.  I will also hope and pray that she takes small risks and learns to accept and cope with her pain, rather than retreating to her ED.I do welcome the chance to keep writing.",dittoditto,"Thu,11/28/2019-12:43pm","Hi MMTF98,","Hi MMTF98,I'm sorry you are having to go through this too.  Something that really helped me, and that you might want to ask your therapist about is Al-anon's teachings.  I know it is geared to relatives of alcoholics, but they are also codependent type of people.  The point of the 12 step program is to learn boundaries.... where your life begins and ends, where your responsibility begins and ends, and putting the focus back on yourself.

And just to say, I thought there really were some interesting and perceptive insights in your note.  As you are probably noticing, it's interesting how situations like this can cause us to think about things that we might never have had to think of before. At the risk of using the ""wisdom"" word…some of that may be the result of this too.  ""I see my wife's suffering with ED as avoiding or resisting some pain through the illusion of control provided by the ED.""Yep, I think that's true.  And oddly, I suspect that folks who have EDs themselves might agree with this too.  Once they reach a point where they become introspective about things I mean.   As you said, the control aspect is such a big part of this, until the tables are turned, that is.  And they come to realize they are the ones being controlled by their EDs, instead of the other way around.  When you hear about the suicide rates among people with ED, my sense is that it's this realization that's often at the heart of that. ""...the shoe fits. ""They have worried themselves sick about other people. That have tried to help in ways that didn't help. . . .They have tried to make other people see things their way"". ""That part is interesting alright.  Because although the outcome can sometimes be negative, the root of the thing stems from caring.  So yes, how odd is that ?  I've been talking with people who have EDs for a couple of decades now.  People who I often develop a deep sense of care for.  So how do I manage to get away with it, in ways that these folks seem to see as helpful ?My guess is that it's because I rarely if ever try and tell people what they should do.  Instead I try and nudge them towards figuring out the answers themselves.  This would be a lot different if it was someone I lived with, though.  I'd probably be tempted to do the ""you should do this, or you should do that"" thing myself.   I must admit that there are times when I do suggest different ways that people might think about things.  But usually I'll say something like….""think of this sort of like a science experiment""….when I suggest other outlooks.  That they could try certain ideas on for size,  as it were, rather than going with the ""you should"" part. Even so, I do have people who I really worry about.  But that part is only human I think. "" My suffering is a reaction to resisting the fear, anger, sadness, and frustration that I can't do anything to ensure her recovery.""That reaction is very human as well, I think.  And that as a caring and emotional person, somehow we're *not* supposed to find ourselves up against feelings like this ?  How human would we be if we didn't experience these feelings ?Part of being able to deal with all this is realizing our limitations - what we can and cannot really hope to accomplish.  And then coming to the realization that ""support"" really does have some value and meaning for the other person.  Even if it may not count as ""doing"", I mean. But you've probably heard me say this before - If we are going to support someone, they really do need to give us something to support. Sometimes they will consciously give us something, while other times it's almost like we need to use a magnifying glass in order to locate the positive bits. So yes, the taking of small risks.  And ""dare to be imperfect"" you know ?These are some of those positive things.

12,vauban01,11-03-19,Wife controls anorexia nervosa with having sex with sb else,"So this might be a bit more complex. Bear with me please, as I'm not a native English speaker.
WARNING: this is only partly about eating disorderMy wife and I have been married for 3 years, but have been together for the five years before in a long-distance-relationship (both from two European countries). She was 19, I was 23 when it started. She's petite and has always been rather slim.
Overall, we both feel very close to each other and have had uncountable great experiences together. Since last fall, we're a family of three and we've also now settled down in my home country. She does speak the language fairly well, but has struggled over the past three years with periods of homesickness and with finding a job. She now has one that makes her quite happy. Our income situation is good, our child is lovely and all the other ""external"" things are improving step by step (house, friendship groups, hobbies, ...).
My wife has been away from home since the age of 13, to a performing arts boarding school. She quit the idea of becoming a performer in some way (or a coach) soon after she'd met me and she's since successfully been to university and now has a degree and said new academic job. Boarding school must have been tough and on several occasions she's shared with me the body and eating struggles she had back then.
During her last year at university (including a job training program), the extreme stress combined with the fear to have to leave her home country in order to finally build a future with me had an impact on her physical and psychological health. She didn't share all of it back then, but she lost weight and struggled. It got better when she came to my country. After our marriage 8 months into her being here, it got worse again.
That's when, as I now know, she met a guy. They met at this language group for immigrants, he's from another European country and has had the same struggles with integrating and adapting to a somewhat ""foreign"" culture. She'd be bubbly and open about whenever they met.
At the time, I was highly stressed in my job. I noticed she'd sometimes struggle getting out of bed and starting her day, she wasn't very successful with finding a job and she also didn't eat a lot, but it wasn't too extreme.
The situation affected me, I connected it to the meetings with this guy and I became suspicious. I finally decided to read her texts and found some suggestive bits that read like a jokey (?) way of flirting. I confronted her. Needless to say she was upset about my spying, but could understand my motives and assured me that nothing had happened. We communicated well and I put my faith in her being honest in the future. As I now know, from this moment on, partly because of this, but also because the other external things didn't get better, she actually started having sex with him. That went on (they only saw each other 4-5 times) for half a year until she decided to stop.
Right after it, we decided to start a family and it immediately worked. During pregnancy, she felt much better, ate plenty and also started a job that made her reasonably content and gave her some structure.
She was worried of postpartum depression, but we worked together to try to avoid it. 1,5 years after she'd stopped having sex with him and when our child was 8 months old (this summer), she ""relapsed"". She knew that breastfeeding would soon be over (and thus a reason to eat regularly), she had a few other challenges coming up and she'd applied to a proper part-time job, which excited her, but also stressed her out (non-native work environment, ...).
After she'd had sex with him again this one more time in June (more details below), she told me the reason our sex life hadn't been what it was in the early years was, in her view, partly due to the fact that she didn't feel a sexual attraction to me anymore. It wasn't accusing, but a very honest and caring confession from her. I am tall and rather slender, but had gained some weight over the last years that showed in some places. It was a massive shock to me, but I decided to do sth against it and have since gone to the gym more often.Now I know that this ""relapse"" triggered what she described as the worst anorexic episode.The summer was difficult. We'd just bought a house, moved in, started renovating, and this ofc added an enormous amount of stress.
She wanted to start treatment. It took some time for the referral, but over the last couple months, she's had her first sessions, which have been productive. Two weeks ago, she told me that her therapist had extended the diagnosis to anorexia nervosa in combination with an addiction and also signs of depression.Also, she hadn't heard from this guy since June and texted him. He gave her some reasons, told her that he'd begun a relationship with a controlling girl (he has his own mental struggles), then told her he wanted to end their friendship/relationship. She told me everything (except the sex), was very distressed about the possible loss of a friend, but also upset about the fact that he didn't really seem to care about her and her current struggles. She'd also just lost her grandfather. She decided to have a final ""goodbye"" meeting because she wanted to completely end this friendship with him. She told me all of this.Now comes the crucial bit:The reasons why I decided to check her texts again was mainly because I felt completely helpless about what to do to help her with her struggles. I did it for myself, but also for the relationship. That is what I told myself.That's how I found out about the 6 months sex relationship with him back in 2017 and the ""relapse"" this June. It seemed to have been more than sex, but in her last texts she talked about how she felt it was a damaging and toxic sort of ""love"" and that she connected it to her eating disorder and her addiction for ""control"" over an aspect of her life: her sex life. When they had sex, it was extremely painful because she closed up, but she didn't tell him. She was shocked that her body showed these signs, because for her, the sex was supposed to be her in control of something. She felt like her body had betrayed her. We talked. It was brutal, but respectful. I was and still am in a dark place. One day later, she told me that because things spiralled down after the last sex/meeting with this guy in June, about four weeks ago, she started having sex with another guy who chatted her up at a cafe. She told me that it was purely sexual and that she did it as a way of remaining in control and to not feel caged with all the struggles that she has atm. She also told me that she and her therapist had discussed all of this just a week ago and that they are currently evaluating whether she doesn't fit into the ""monogamy"" category. Needless to say, I was already damaged enough, so this was just another brutal confession, but what choice did I have?We didn't cancel last weekend's trip, our anniversary weekend trip, but instead tried to use it to talk and start rebuilding.Because I am so worried about her mental health and because I feel like due to therapy, her job and other things currently slowly improving / stabilising, I have to grant her to continue seeing this guy once a week or so. She admits she doesn't know whether it's purely her need of control of dealing with her eating disorder, or also a way of dealing with her only recently discovered non-monogamic desires.It's a complete dilemma for me. The broken trust about what happened in the past is one thing, but I feel like this will eventually be forgivable and something we can leave behind. The combination of me now having to work on myself (body, ...?) in order to appeal attractive to her again combined with having to tolerate her sex meetings because she seems to be in a (temporarily?!) psycho-somatic need of it is just really, really hard. She said that for her sexual intimacy and romantic/relationship intimacy are two not completely, but fairly different things, meaning that she fully and unconditionally loves me and that she doesn't question our relationship one single bit. She was utterly shaken when I honestly told her that since being loyal is such a big thing for me (at least unless both partners are on eye-level and agree on giving each other a bit of ""freedom"" for a while), I was struggling to keep the option of separating out of my head. Over the last few days, we have supported each other whenever the other one had a breakdown: me because of what happened and because of my constant thoughts about what we have now agreed on (and the subsequent feelings of weakness and inferiority that gives me), her because she is so ashamed and guilty of what she's done and how it has affected me. I've always been the calm rock in our relationship, and she's never seen me like this. One more thing: we've both told a good friend, who is impressed at how ""gracefully"" I am handling the situation.We have decided to go to couple's therapy. She ofc is continuing her psychological treatment. She wants to stay above a certain weight because she's still in probation for her new job and because she couldn't endure being stationary and away from her child and me. She wants to consider going stationary when things have settled down a bit, though. I am working on my body and body image, but try to do it in a way where I can say I do it for myself.
She knows she is hurting me a lot with this. I know that if I fully believe her that all of this is true and that it's a life-line for her at the moment, I can't possibly reject her that need without either jeopardizing her health, or our relationship as a whole. It's a dilemma, and we both want to work on it.The extreme amount of love that we show towards each other is making me feel optimistic. The worry about how long this arrangement/situation is going to stay the way it is is making me feel sick. I have asked myself seriously and I could possibly imagine tolerating her having the occasional sex outside of our relationship if OUR sex life, and therefore, to me, our relationship as a whole, is okay again. It DOES have to do with my insecurities, yes, so I feel like that needs to be taken care of before I could possibly give the idea of a partly-open (sex) relationship a thought. I have a strong urge not to tell her this contemplation of mine because I'm still afraid that she might take this as a sign that things aren't as serious as they are. I'm sincerely sorry for going in-depth and into detail. The reason is that I feel that ALL of this matters. It isn't ""just"" an eating disorder. It isn't ""just"" a current lack of physical attraction. It isn't ""just"" her having sex with other men. It's a complex and tangled combination of all of these.I am aware that this board is about eating disorders and not about such a complex multi-facaded issue, but if anything, this text of mine might make some people realise the complexity of eating-disorder-related issues in a marriage. If anyone has any input at all, please do so. As I said, we are going go to to couple's therapy and I might also seek for professional help on my own. I am aware that no community board can replace that. Thank you so much for your patience, if you made it until here!!! :)",BobJ48,"Thu,11/07/2019-3:36am",Vauban.,"Dear Vauban,This sounds like a difficult and complicated situation, but here's a few thoughts that I had.First of all, I suspect that she's not telling these guys about her eating disorder, and that this is one of the reasons she goes to them and not you.  She can feel ""accepted"" by them, and perhaps accepted by herself,  as long as they don't know all of these things.  So she has relations with them in which she doesn't really have to be honest about herself.In contrast to her relationship with you, where she does have to be honest.  You actually do know about her, which may be the very thing which makes things so difficult for her.  You may think it has something to do with your appearance, but I suspect that no matter how much time and effort you spend getting in shape, the intimacy problems are still going to be there. My sense is that she worries about her acceptability as a person.  As long as she is with people who don't really know the full truth about her, she can feel OK.  But with someone who does know all about her, she doesn't feel OK about herself.   If that makes any sense ?So my sense is that until she starts to feel good about the person she is, including all her inner complexities, being with you is going to continue to be a problem for her, no matter how much you try and reassure her about your love and concern.  I must tell you, this is a VERY common problem between couples, and something I  have heard about over and over.  Things are wonderful at the beginning of the relationship, and the partners feel love and affection…until the person reveals the truth about their eating disorder. This is a very intimate revelation, but rather than the relationship becoming more intimate, the partner begins to withdraw instead.What your partner may be trying to do with these fellows, is to replicate the original feelings she had, before she reveled her problems to you.  This is why I said that I bet she is NOT telling any of these men about her ED.  If she did, I suspect she'd quickly be  done with them too. Again, this is just my opinion, but my guess is that if things are ever going to be good for her, she'll need to work on personal acceptance. Rather than constantly presenting an incomplete view of herself to a string of unsuspecting sex partners. Because I suspect that being with all of these fellows, and her knowledge of how unfair it is to you, is not helping her feel better about herself - in the larger picture it's making her feel worse about herself instead. How much patience you are willing to have with this process is up to you.  If it seems like she's honestly trying to face up to things, and is trying to get better, then that gives you something healthy that you can support.  But if she keeps going in the direction she's going…that doesn't really give you much to support at all.  And I suspect you are seeing how that makes you feel, no matter how much affection you may have for her.Couples counseling is a very healthy thing, I think.  You'll have to keep an eye on the sorts of positions she wants to take though.Hopefully the counselor you see will be able to accurately assess what's going on, and help point the both of you in the right direction, because the way things are at the moment doesn't sound like it's ever going to be healthy or happy for either of you.I'm sorry that your note sat here for a while with no response, but if you see this keep writing ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,BlueJasmine,10/18/2019,Feeling Helpless & Guilty,"Hello, I am writing as I am confused and I am also needing to organize my thoughts, but also would like some input from fellow people more familiar with this that I am. I met this woman last July and things were electric/karmic I would say. There was an instant attraction and warmth to one another. There was certainly a bond in some same pattern of the past for sure. About 4 weeks into our relationship we were at a restaurant and she had eaten what I seemed to be a bit much, and I could tell her body was not responding well to the situation. She removed herself from the table and went to the bathroom for about 15 minutes. She came back and her body language was completely different and a sense of relief seemed to have come over her, like she was almost high in some way. My instincts kicked in and I was very aware something had shifted in her energy. I thought I wonder if there is something going on her I am not being told about. Sure enough I did some deep research while she was asleep and put all the dots together and thought I think this could be it. Later that night she woke up and we actually broached the subject and she admitted that she has anorexia and bulimia and has been dealing with it since age of 14. She is now 40, almost 41. We continued to date and proceed and I told her I was not sure how to handle all of this or if I could, but I was certainly interested in researching, exploring and assisting if needed and could be done. A few more random dates, a few more trips to the bathroom, one day she did not eat for over 48 hours except some type of food. I started seeing the red flag conductor come out and warn me this is serious and I am not equipped to handle the severity of this. But, I stayed as there is a very serious attraction to her personality and smile etc. There was some more exposure over the next couple of months, but as if about Mid September she just froze up and pulled away. She was back on Match, we got into some difficult communication and bumps in the road and she basically shut this relationship down and was seeking another within 48 hours of a fight. I wrote her a letter suggesting she get help and gave her a resource, found some therapist and have been doing extensive research. However, I feel that I am simply doing the surface work for her and she is not about facing the seriousness of what is going on. I then found out about the end of September that she has been taking medication everyday since she was 15 along side of all of this. It seems she has been prescribed for Narcolepsy. I cannot discount the need for that, but it sure seems a coincidence that it works so well for her eating disorder and that no attempt is being made at alternative choices for a chronic medical condition such as narcolepsy. I am clearly not a Dr, but it seems to fit together to well in her narrative. I am terribly concerned for her. She is very underweight, her body has suffered extreme malnutrition, she has that fine downy hair on her arms and legs, headaches, dizzy, nausea all the time, migraines, and a host of other symptoms that lead to extreme signs of malnutrition. Our relationship has ended, but I ruminate and completely bounce back and forth to letting it go, to extreme guilt. She was lying to me in the relationship about her situation, about other men, and about many things. I can't help but feel guilty, lost and confused as to why she would just up and leave and say no more. When out of her very own lips were the words, I love you, never met anyone like you, want to do this with you, and so much sign of affection while at the same time completely being deceitful, dishonest and hurtful. We don't communicate anymore, and I worry she may simply stay in her realm for the rest of her life and there is nothing I can do. She did say one last thing that she was going to get help but on her terms! That felt to me like an addict saying I can control this and will work it out. One thing I do know is when it comes to mental health is you cannot do your own open heart surgery of if you do it requires some serious tenacity and effort.. Should I just let this go? Is she really in trouble and I just cannot see it? Is she capable of being in a relationship and truly loving someone? I am so confused.. thanks",BobJ48,"Fri,10/18/2019-6:20pm",Hey there Blue J.,"Oh brother, this has got to be so confusing !  Here she is, with the ""I love you"" and ""I've never meant anyone like you"" and then, rather than things becoming more emotionally intimate, instead she shuts the thing down.  And being the sort of person we are, somehow we're not supposed to be worried ?Having said that, I must tell you, after reading literally thousands of posts from partners over the years, this ""pulling away"" thing is the number one thing that partners show up to talk about. So yeah, it's super common, and it's not because of anything wrong that you did.  Unless caring, and wanting to know more about the person can be called wrong, that is. This is a dilemma for them too. They understand that if they have a partner that cares, they ARE going to care about the eating disorder.  I read messages from people who have EDs themselves, and they complain when they have dull-witted partners who don't care.  And yet here they are, caught  in this condition which  A) serves as a coping method, and B) which seems unsolvable.  They hate the idea of being a burden on anyone, and feel bad enough about their situation as it is, and so the best solution can seem like withdrawing from the relationship altogether. Maybe the next time they'll get some guy and they simply won't tell them anything.  That would make things simpler, you know ?  But I'm sure you can imagine how that usually works out. So yeah, a person's brain is not fully formed until they are 25, and she's had this stuff obsessively swirling around in her head since she was 14.  It's probably no wonder that it's etched itself in and has stuck with her.  And that ""getting better"" may take a whole lot of work, when a person's become all wired up like that. I'm not sure what to tell you, as far as what to do.  As you may be finding, it can be pretty easy to find ourselves falling into that ""rescuing"" mindset.  Which to be frank, really does show that we are a good-hearted person.  But it's been my experience that the ""Love is all you need"" cure rarely works.It's the person themselves who has to get over this.  Can we be supportive, and will it help ?  I believe we can.  But as you found, the person has to willingly provide us with something to support.And that can be where the rub is.Bob J.",BlueJasmine,"Fri,10/18/2019-9:29pm",Hello,"HelloThank you for responding. Your words mean a lot as you have much more experience than I do in these arenas. I hear what you are saying and yes, it seems painfully clear to me that this has been going on for some time in her life and I suspect due to some trauma and or happenings from a younger age. I don't know her past well, but am aware of some issues that certainly could have induced this behavior. I can see that person inside just beaming with life and she exists now as if a (wet, wool sock is smothering) her whole perception of life itself. I understand that she must be the one to fix it, and she has no support system or family that will be aware enough to encourage change, and I certainly do not believe the environment she lives in is any kind of catalyst for pushing for a healthier space. I truly felt, that something brought us together and that it would so beautiful if she could see that the man that just walked into her life is compassionate, caring and completely desirous for her health and well being. I know I cannot be with her and enable her and choose to say, ""ok this if your lifestyle"" let us continue to move forward. I simply cannot be in that much pain watching her slowly harm herself everyday. While on the other hand, stepping away feels like abandonment to me as so many people have done in her life. I am caught because my feelings for her romantically are still tragically entangled in the mesh of our situation, but along side of that I want to be able to step out of that alignment and be a stronger man and give her the unconditional support she needs. However, I am still so hurt and broken from the lies and deceit thrown at me with any regard for our (shared feelings) that I believed were so very real. Sometimes, I worry that I am being taken advantage of by my caring, empathy and walked on and it is a way to control the relationship and or her life. Maybe it is a way for her to keep control of me and everything around her. Maybe until she decides, I cannot live like this anymore I seriously need to change cause that is no longer working. No matter what anyone says or does, until she is ready to make a commitment and release all control and trust that a higher source of energy can bring her around- I am stuck in silence. I fear even reaching out and sending her more literature I have done and researched. I have been reading about this for weeks and weeks now and somewhat becoming a bit obsessive as it relieves my pain and sadness that we are no longer. However, I guess I must commit to a boundary within myself. Again, thanks for the kind words. It truly does help me understand a bit better and to know this is a common thread among ED individuals lessens the sting. But, I still cringe that she quit on us so quickly and walked away from what seemed to be a very supportive male in her life that has been rare in her journey.",BobJ48,"Sat,10/19/2019-12:58pm", Back at you…Our good nature.,"Blue,Situations like this can be emotionally entangling alright, so I'm sending you all my sympathies for that part. And I know about the reading too.  I literally had to build a new bookshelf at one point.  I'm not sure how much I learned that I was able to practically apply - when it comes to how people actually recover, as you may be seeing, that part often gets kind of vague.  But a person can get a general outline of the condition, so that part is good, and…well….at least it feels like we are doing something, even if it's just reading books.You wrote :""... it would so beautiful if she could see that the man that just walked into her life is compassionate, caring and completely desirous for her health and well being. ""Indeed.  That sounds like something that anyone might want. And there were all of those positive things in the beginning.  So it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense when they begin acting as though they see the good parts you listed as some kind of threat instead. But the thing is, their eating disorder sees it as a threat.  If one is willing to personify a disorder that way.  I mentioned that this scenario is common, and the way it goes is generally like this : Everything is wonderful between the two people in the beginning, and things look like they are heading in a loving direction.  Until the beans get spilled about the ED, that is.  The fellow is concerned and compassionate, but it's almost like the more they care, the more the pushing-away thing happens. And it's because the person's ED feels threatened by all the concern, and fights to perserve itself.  Or however one cares to frame it. The scenario can be different if the person truly wants to get better, and they have some shreds of hope that recovery actually might be possible for them.  Allowing themselves to have some hope; that seems to be what makes the difference.  But if their ED is ingrained to the point where they believe that it's going to be with them forever, well, I think you are seeing how it can be.  Having a partner who is eager to see things get better is not always something that they can emotionally welcome. And you are right, it is kind of tragic.  They may want a relationship, but having one in which everything is out on the table…it can feel like too much for them. So it's a sad thing for sure, and can leave us feeling helpless as well.Taking care of our own mental health in situations like these is important as well.  Just writing some words on some website may not seem like much, but I'm glad that you have, and hope it feels like it's helping a little.Bob J",dittoditto,"Sat,10/19/2019-8:33pm",Escape,Sometimes escape from an emotionally damaging relationship is a blessing.  Maybe you are meant to meet a healthier partner.Sending best wishes.,BlueJasmine,"Tue,10/29/2019-7:03pm","Hello,","Hello,Thanks for your comments and information. I have talked with a few therapist to get through some of this. I will share this in my discovery. When this woman first admitted to her ED with me during a stay at a hotel. It was very interesting how she treated me. The issue became me leaving the relationship and her anger that I may leave and so our focus became that and not the ED itself. It was very sad to me, as we never discussed the Elephant in the Room so to speak. Now looking back on my experience with her I found myself navigating my behavior to work around her ED. There was never again a discussion about her making a choice to finding a solution. It simply became now part of ""our"" relationship and I found myself asking her.. Did you eat enough? What would you like? Did you drink any water today? Did you eat today? Try these vegetable drinks? I found I was no simply working around something that is very serious and she never once said.. Maybe I should take a look at this as a I am certainly not coming into this relationship with the healthiest frame of mind.. My point being is that now the relationship was all about controlling my behavior around a very serious mental condition that pervaded the relationship fully. I am understanding at the depths at which she is struggling now. It is very deep and very much a part of her so much so that she talks about it freely with me when we were together accepting as a way of life. I now see how much she raged at me when ever I tried to approach her about the seriousness of it and she never again engaged in taking any responsibility in the relationship or her behavior and I now see everything was my fault and I was made responsible for it ending..I think my point it as much as I wanted to believe that she was engaging with me on a pure healthy level, I was unaware of how much this was truly controlling her and how much control she needed in EVERYTHING in her life, including her partner. I am still sad, and frustrated as I thought I saw someone peeking out at times that was just simply amazing to be around.. But I got devalued, discarded and pushed away...Thanks for all the help..I have not had communication in over 3 weeks and I doubt I will hear from her and I suspect that her journey has not shifted and won't until she admits the seriousness of her mental state.. I hope she does, I really do  - there is more out there in life.. It is sad when you only dance in the brown and black hues of the crayon box, when there are so many other colors of life to experience..I miss her..",BobJ48,"Tue,10/29/2019-7:27pm",Blue J -Control.,"""...I was unaware of how much this was truly controlling her and how much control she needed in EVERYTHING in her life, including her partner…""Yes, at their heart, EDs are about control.  And really, don't we all want to be in control ?But with EDs the whole subject can become pathological. And folks lose the ability to be flexible.  And things can really start to get bad when the person begins to realize that they are really no longer in control - It's the ED that is in control of them. Three weeks is a long time I know.  And it's likely to be longer.  Because it does sound like your relationship with her was challenging to her eating disorder in ways that she could no longer tolerate. Hopefully things will finally turn in a good direction for her, and you'll hear from her again sometime.

14,dittoditto,10/27/2019,Not sure what to do,"My husband has had memory issues since before his ED.  At one point he was gorging until he became obese. Then suddenly he switched to restricting.  We've been complaining to his doctors about his memory issues for 9 years and they are finally listening to us and are sending him to a neurologist and neuropsychologist tomorrow.I suspect that there is an underlying cause for dementia. His father had it and his sister has Alzheimer's.  But I also suspect that malnutrition is also part of the equation.  My husband will not admit to restricting and denies that he is doing anything unhealthy.  It causes a fight if I bring it up, and I have taken the attitude that it is his body and his right to mistreat it, and it is he who will suffer the consequences and I have to give him the dignity to deal with all this himself.  I have my own issues to deal with.So, having said all of this, I was instructed to attend this medical meeting/testing tomorrow.  I know that my husband will not bring up his ED and will deny it if it is brought up.  I have typed up a note outlining the restrictive eating, which I can try to find a way to get to his doctor to read.  What should I do?  Should I let the doctor just focus finding the cause for the dementia?  It is in his family, so this isn't a result of ED.  Or, should I pass the note to someone to get to the doctor which mentions the restrictive eating?  I don't want to bring it up in front of my husband because I don't want to deal with his nastiness any more.  Frankly, even if I bring it up to a doctor, I doubt my husband will do anything about his ED until he is good and ready... if that time should ever come.  So, it would probably be all in vain anyway.What are your thoughts?",BobJ48,"Mon,10/28/2019-11:23am",Info for Doctor,"Hey Ditto,Oh brother, who knows. I guess part of it might have to do with what the doctors see as the point of the meeting.  Do they simply want to confirm that he does indeed have memory issues, do they want to try and figure out where they might be coming from, are they going to propose a treatment plan, or what ?   One would think they would want to do all three, but you know how these sorts of things can go.It probably would not hurt to inform the docs, but if you did, would that mean that they would want to confront him about it ?  My sense is that unless he admits to it, or he looks like death warmed over, then they may not press him on the matter.   After all, he's been having these memory issues for 9 years, and unless he's been restricting for that long too, they may dismiss the eating end of things.It's probably going to have to do with the doctors, and how eager they are to consider issues outside the standard neurological ones. Even if they take what you wrote seriously, they may see themselves strictly as neurological guys, and not doctors that deal with psychiatric matters.But yes, getting someone professionally interested in an ED is not always easy, particularly if the client themselves doesn't see it as an issue, and might even openly deny it, if they were asked about it directly.  Sometimes even young women have a difficult time getting doctors to pay attention, even when they come right out and tell their doctors that they are having problems. So once again, it's another one of the frustrations that EDs so often involve, in that any forward motion on the issue is probably going to depend on your husband himself being willing to acknowledge  the situation first, if at some point doctors or therapists are going to be involved.",dittoditto,"Mon,10/28/2019-5:47pm",Thank you,"It makes me feel sooo much better to know that someone understands the frustration of trying to get a doctor to understand what an ED entails and means, especially when we are talking about a male, and I am an ""hysterical woman seeing boogeymen around corners"".  So, I did bring it up, just because there was an opening and I thought perhaps it might be worth mentioning.  To give my husband his due, he did not dispute that he isn't eating enough, or that he is consumed by thoughts of calories fat, and body image.  He did deny that this is meaningful or problematic, and he did infer that perhaps I have issues which need to be addressed.So, off I was whisked to take a psychological evaluation to see if I am depressed.  No, I am not depressed, but for the moment I am angry.  My husband feels it is nice to see them taking a whole family approach to his memory issues.  They also kept referring to me as his ""caregiver"" and I kept correcting them that I am his spouse.I remind myself again that this is not my problem, that I must give him the respect to deal with his body and his issues in his own way, that I am far from perfect.Meanwhile, he has an MRI and lab work scheduled for this week.  Next month we get to hear the results of all these tests and their plan of action for his memory issues.

I don’t know how to feel about this. I don’t want that either but I typically have snacks for her to eat in the car or at home if she has time. He’s been doing morning routine because he’s off this week. We are parenting differently across the board. He hasn’t reached out to talk to anyone about her eating disorder, I’ve asked him to. It’s all me. Finding counsel, I’ve looked for a support group for us....I’m feeling very alone in it. I have had multiple conversations about things counselors tell me, etc. he nods. This is already a problem in our marriage so I guess I expect it. We’re not separated at this point but will be. Im concerned with the mixed parenting, non-communication on his part. I only know absolutely anything when I ask. Also, am I supposed to be offering her a snack in the morning?

And what, do they think that you are somehow making a bigger deal out of it than you should ?  It's true : Just as a matter of human nature, no one want's there to be ""a problem"" but that kind of thinking doesn't help things too much.So yes, it sounds like a big mess alright, and you have every right to feel distressed.

17,NCH125,10/18/2019,Fiancee wont admit,"Hey all, first time posting here! Unfortunately I feel like I'm running out of options, time and sanity with this problem. My fiancee won't admit to her ED. I love her to bits, she is my world. We've been together for 3 years and recently got engaged and when things are good, it's the best feeling in the world being with her. But I also know shes bulimic. The signs are all there, she's unnaturally skinny, she snacks a lot and likes to have big portions at meal times, and then always goes to the bathroom after every meal/snack. I have known for a while. I first found out not long into our relationship when we were living in my parents house, where they found a lot of discarded food packages in the bin and when questioned, she admitted it was from her. She then told me in private how she used to be bulimic before she met me but since got over it. She just relapsed this particular day but she insisted she was over it. At the time I was ignorant on the subject so have researched it a lot since. Like I say the signs have all been there but at first I went about it the wrong way, confronting her, following her to the bathroom, we had some huge fights over it. Since then the more I researched, the more I realised this was not the way to help, it's more up to her to face up to it and the day she does, I'll be here to support. But like I say we're now 3 years in and it's the same routine everyday. She eats and snacks, goes to the bathroom to purge, she comes out and I ask if everything is okay, she says yes and then we leave it there. But the problem is it festers inside of me, sometimes I can just leave it because she needs to confront it herself, sometimes I can't help but start asking questions until we end up in a huge fight. The past few weeks it's been okay, up till today when she's gone to work and left her phone at home. I've gone on it to check her emails, simply because there was an online order we needed to sort, but I've gone to her deleted items and found several takeaway receipts on days when I've been at work and shes been at home, and shes told me nothing about these. In fact when I ask what she had for lunch, not in any suspicious way it's just something we do as a couple, she'll tell one thing, but now I'm seeing it's something else. It's by discovering this today that has led me to posting on here now. I don't know how much longer I can cope with this. I suffer from trust issues, I've had terrible relationships in the past. My fiancee knows this, in fact before we started dating she was incredibly helping and understanding when I was having problems with an ex, so she knows all that about me. By knowing she's hiding all this from me is really triggering me. I know I shouldn't take it so personally and the main thing is I just want to help her, I'm absolutely terrified of her doing serious damage to herself. We've planned out whole lives together, talked about having kids in the not so distant future, and I really want to have this life with her. But at the same time I'm struggling with how she's hiding her ED and keep having terrible thoughts of her killing herself from the bulimia. But like I say she won't admit to it so I feel helpless in what to do. I have only come up with two ideas, one being posting on here. Two is speaking to her mother. My fiancee how told me how her mother also used to be bulimic right up until she become pregnant with her, and the doctor told her she needs to stop the bulimia or she'll do serious damage to her baby. So I thought if I confessed to her mother that I worry shes being bulimic maybe she could help, but also worry my fiancee will be mad that I've dragged her mother into something she says is not existent. Please help guys I dont know what to do.",BobJ48,"Fri,10/18/2019-5:23pm",Not admitting.,"Hey NCH,Here's one thing I can promise you : She's not happy about the fact that she's lying to you.  You may think she's thinking ""Oh, he's so sensitive, so I just have to lie"".  That may be some of it, because people with EDs despise the idea of being an emotional burden on their loved ones.   But the point I want to make is that I don't think she's lying because you are somehow being unreasonable in your concerns. And really, she knows that too.  Because any reasonable and caring partner would be concerned.So what are you supposed to say, that might have a chance of making things better ?  Not something that would stop her from being bulimic, because that's the other person's task, but which might help with the tension that's between you ?  My sense has always been that trying to put ourself in the other person's shoes, and then thinking what we might want to hear, is a good place to start crafting our responses.The other thing I try and keep in mind is a belief that what helps people feel a little better is when they feel that the other person really does understand at least some of their situation.  Which is...that their situation is a difficult one. She doesn't like lying to you, and as is often the case with people who purge, they generally aren't happy about the fact that they are doing that either.  Which is true - Not many people with bulimia are happy about being bulimic.So one thing you might say is something like ""I know it must be hard to feel like you have to keep hiding this from me.""  Which I can pretty much promise is just how she feels.""Not being able to have much control over this…I know that must be difficult too.""Which is another statement which is sure to be true.  In any case, just some suggestions as to statements which might help defuse some of the tension.  It can be pretty hard to know what to say sometimes, but anything that shows that you ""get it"" is usually welcome I've found.And keep in touch here too, if it seems to help.  In situations where there's no easy answers, it doesn't hurt to have a place to vent now and then.Bob J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,momliz,10-06-19,Multiple Family Members with Eating Disorders,"I have been married for 20 years and my husband has always been an exercise enthusiast.  His mother is also, and 10 years ago she admitted to me that she had exercise bulimia. She cited to me several examples of disordered behavior.  When she told me this story she said she is much better now and not to worry that she is healed.  My husband idolizes his mother and credits her for his love of exercise and fitness. When she visits our house, she often times brings her own food, brings a dish to share (that is so gross she is the only one to eat it)or she says she's already eaten and not to worry about her.  When she visits, she, my husband and sometimes his cousin talk about foot constantly. She tells my husband how great he looks and that she's so glad he's eating healthy. They talk about all the different diets to the point where my sister-in-law and I just leave the room.  Family gatherings have become difficult because of everyone's eating preferences and schedules.  About 3 years ago, I brought up my concern with my husband , his mother and my father-in-law because of the impression it was making on our teenage children.  I was berrated for not understanding that they were just trying to be ""healthy"" and that I should just let everyone eat what they want to eat without interfering.  Fast forward to the present, along with my husbands day job, he is also a fitness instructor.  He has lost some noticeable weight.  I voiced my concern to him as gently as I could, but he said he is ""healthy"" and feels great.  I am concerned for him, and now I am concerned for my teenage daughter who has been suffering from panic attacks recently and I see her starting to take on some of the food eating habits exhibited by my husband and his mother and cousin.  I am in the process of finding her a therapist and I don't know what to do about my husband who thinks he is a great example and flaunts his eating and exercise to the kids.  Is he being healthy and I don't see it?  Or does he have a problem?  When he says he's being healthy, I don't know how to counter that.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",BobJ48,"Thu,10/17/2019-9:31pm",""" Is he being healthy and I don't see it? ""","Hey Liz,Sorry that your post sat here for a while, but I hope you check in at some point and see this.And yes, the whole ""being healthy"" thing can often be a mask for obsessive behaviors.  It's insidious too, because like the sort of self-discipline that anorexics express, it can be a thing that gets socially praised and that normal people often envy.  So yes, how could there possibly be anything wrong with fitness and being healthy ? Or for that matter weight loss too.The answer of course revolves around the obsessive part.  Folks with classic sorts of eating dissorders will often speak about this.  How their every waking moment is consumed with thoughts of food or exercise or numbers.  Frequently it's their inability to clear their heads of these thoughts , and the growing rigidity of their actions, that is the thing that finally leads them to thinking about recovery.So that's one test I think.  If you husband could spend a week or so without exercising, and eating the sorts of food that most normal people eat, without finding himself consumed with anxiety.   Most people would be able to be flexible about that, and might make jokes about it in some form or another.  But for people who have obsessive issues, it's deadly a serious matter instead.Plus, if it's a thing that's impacting your family and your relationship, how can that not be called a problem ?  So that's a legitimate concern as well.In any case, I think talking with a therapist might be good for both you and your daughter.  I know, I know : No one wants to make things seem more serious than they are, but there are things here that are worth sorting out I think, and getting some perspective from a counsellor can often be a good way to help with that. In any case, sending good wishes your way.  Matters like this can often seem kind of opaque, but you are not being silly by being concerned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,JohnnyBravo,10-10-19,"Girlfriend with anorexia nervosa, trying to be as supportive as I possibly can..","So my girlfriend who is the love of my life was diagnosed some time ago with anorexia nervosa. Lately she's been trying to find help and reaching out to counselors and therapists. It seems that she can be very selective who she wants to have as an counselor or therapist and I can understand that. But as much as I try to be there for her, I'm not sure if she's getting the help to appease myself and her family or if it's actually for her. She keeps calorie counts which is common with this disease and she doesn't like to eat that much in one day otherwise she will feel guilty. And even though she may not eat much she doesn't also have severe constipation and she doesn't like to oftenly listen to a doctor's advice on what and how stuff should be treated. This girls the Love of my Life and it hurts me everyday to watch her obsess with her size and guilt tripping herself when she feels she had ate to much. I cook almost everything she eats and count the calories in what I make her, I don't want to feel like I'm enabling her though and I don't know if I am. Some days she eats such a low intake that I become very worrisome. When I ask her why she continues she tells me that she wants to be her best self and look beautiful for me, but I know its a cover or diversion from her real answer because I've told her a couple hundreds of times I don't care about her weight I care about her health. I just hope I can find some advice on this situation currently, sorry to bother anybody but I'm worried she may get worse before she gets better and I need to see her get better before the serious health complications begin.
Thank You,
Johnny",dittoditto,"Thu,10/10/2019-10:07pm",Boundaries,"Hi Johnny Bravo,I'm very sorry you are having to go through this.  Lately, there haven't been a lot of responses to posts.  So, I will do my best.  Eating disorders are a mental illness.  Mental illnesses, like addictions, can suck in the people who care for them and make you just as ill.The first thing you need to research and understand is: ""what is enabling"".  The second thing you need to accept is that you didn't cause it, you can't control it and you can't cure it,  And you need to understand how lacking this boundary feeds into ""enabling"".  You need to look deeply into yourself to find out why you think you have the ability and the ""right"" to ""fix"" another person.  Instead, you should be looking at yourself and working on your own issues.You also need to understand why you are allowing her behaviors to shape your behaviors.That sounds really mean.  And it sounds really uncaring.  But it is the most honest and caring thing anyone can tell you.  Because until you can do this, you are enabling your loved one's illness.  She needs to be respected enough to deal with the consequences of her actions.  Only then will she be able to make informed decisions.My suggestion for you would be to seek out a therapist to work with so you learn to set the boundaries that you need to set for yourself.  I would also suggest finding an Al-anon group and working on their 12-step program for yourself.  I know she isn't an alcoholic, but the coping skills you need are the same.Sending best wishes. This is a really difficult disorder both to live with and to cure.",JohnnyBravo,"Fri,10/11/2019-8:22am",I've noticed not many replies,"I've noticed not many replies on a lot of threads so I'm glad you responded. I'll do my best to take your advice, her and I both come from a background of addiction but we're both clean now. The only problem is she switched drugs for this. Some people look at the problem and say why don't you just eat but I now understand it's deeper then that. The body dysmorphia also plays a huge role in this issue, I'll try to find a therapist who is suited enough to try and help me with setting some boundaries up. And as much as I try to work on myself, I always constantly worry about her. I especially don't want her illness to be the reason I ever lose her, because it would honestly break me to lose her in my life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

21,WornOutAndNumbH...,05-05-19,16 year rollercoaster ride with my 55+ yr old wife with ED,"First time posting here after reading some very helpful posts from guys in similar situations.Can you believe a grandmother of 9 is still struggling with ED? That's my wife.
We've been happily married for almost 35+ years and at age 40 she bought into the lie of EDs.That's when she started dieting and exercising a lot. It was a slow process until one day I realized it was getting extreme. I confronted her about it and she got real defensive. I gave her some literature about ED and she angrily gave it right back to me. Her exercising increased. She withdrew from social and family events because there was food. Thankfully our daughters never went down that path. At one point her wrists and ankles started to swell. She was knocking on death's door. I should have taken her to the hospital right then. She put some weight on for a while but not for long. When I told my wife that other people were asking me if she's okay, that hit her between the eyes, and she started to put on a little weight again. (Probably to hide the obvious from others.) She rode that fine line for many years. Sometimes a little above or below. She became more controlling about simple stuff.She's got hundreds of cookbooks, bakes cookies and bars for me to share at work, and won't ever eat a single one herself. When our whole family goes out to dinner together, she does not eat much. We have never had dinner or lunch at our kid's houses because they know she won't eat what they make. She hasn't seen a doctor in over 8 yrs when she had a bike accident that almost killed her with head injuries. While she was semi-conscious in the hospital, she told me she hated my guts. She doesn't remember anything about her hospital stay.Our grown kids are losing patience with me that I can't get her to seek help. She refuses since her family used to ridicule people who got counseling. A few years ago our pastor asked my wife if she needed help with ED. She has hated him for it ever since.I confronted her 4 weeks ago about losing weight again and pleaded with her to get help or at least get a check up which she hasn't had since her accident. SHE WILL NOT GO! We argued until she didn't have a leg to stand on. I kept the conversation focused on her health. She kept trying to drag in my shortcomings from the past. Finally I wrote her a couple letters since I can get my points across better that way. Since the letters, she has gained XX pounds. And it shows. She has stopped exercising cold turkey! She's reading books instead. Novels.She hasn't talked to me in the last 4 weeks. She is hopping mad at me. If looks could kill.
So today I broke the ice and told her to get it off her chest. She blew up at me and pointed out all my faults to control the conversation, and told me she recovered by herself without help, and said she hated me. Ouch!The gained weight and no exercise for a month is the biggest change she has ever made. She told our daughter she doesn't ever want to go back to that low weight. Now I finally realize why she hates me so much. I'm the biggest threat to the secret lie of ED that hides inside her!! Just like our pastor a few years ago.I want my wife back...and without the lie of ED sitting on her shoulder everyday. It's like a little demon took control of her 16 years ago and she doesn't see it.
I have talked to a great ED counselor a couple times in the last few years but she said my wife needs to make that decision. Well my wife won't listen to me. Is it up to our kids to tell her? Don't know how to proceed from here.",dittoditto,"Wed,05/08/2019-10:30pm",Worn Out,"Welcome to the club.  My husband's ED wears me out too.  The very sad thing is that unless someone wants to change, no one can force them to change.  The only one you can force to change is yourself.

They are killing their brains along with every other organ in their body through starvation.I wish I had an answer for us both.  Therapy for you might be helpful.  Sometimes al-anon is helpful because people dealing with alcoholics face the same type of issues.  We all need to learn that we cannot control this demon, we did not cause this demon, we cannot cure this demon.  I think this is the very hardest lesson we have to learn.

And these are just the few things that are noticeable on the outside. Can't imagine all the things going wrong on the inside. At this point I don't think I'll ever get my ""real wife"" back.

Like Ditto said, they have to want to make changes, and you've seen how difficult that can be.Not to try and put a happy face on the situation, but the fact that she actually *has* had periods of time when she actually did gain weight is significant I think.  You've seen just how stubborn EDs can be, so the idea that (at least for a few times) she was able to push past the obsessions and actually eat, and somehow tolerate seeing the numbers on the scale go up….from an emotional standpoint, not that many people with EDs can manage to do that.  Even if she did relapse later.People with EDs often have this idea about being perfect.  So yeah, when you criticize her for actually accomplishing what she considers perfection….she may find herself hating you for that.   It's all nonsense of course, because a part of her is aware that it's all self-destructive, but at the same time she can feel *really* resentful for you daring to point that out to her.  Even though she knows it herself.But yes, she'll have to make her own decision.  She already knows what you think, and understands that you have good reasons for feeling the way that you do.  She may hate you for it, but EDs are strange that way.Perhaps having the kids say something might help, if she is still on good terms with them.  Having them understand how hard it can be for her to change, and letting her know that they understand that, might help her feel less resentful towards any concerns they might express.Because yeah, no one likes the idea of having their nose rubbed in the fact that they've managed to box their own self into a corner.

Last week our daughter was told by my wife that I wouldn't talk to her. My daughter knows that's not true because I previously told my daughter I've had to write letters to my wife just to communicate. My wife has never been a blatant liar like that before. Desperation?
I'm always the one who says bye in the morning and hi when I get home from work. All I get is a glorified grunt in return. But if I don't say hi or bye, then this whole lack of communication thing will end up being my fault from the start. I'm not giving her any scapegoats.Last week I put a piece of tape on the bottomside her treadmill's track belt to see if she's using it when I'm not home. When I checked later I saw it had been used. The more I understand this mental illness, the more I see how things she did in the past were about keeping control of her surroundings. That's why she fianlly started using a smart phone this year.

My FIL did not tell the truth about his behaviors and he was very distrustful of us.  I thought that was very strange because he was the one eroding our trust, but he didn't see it that way.  My husband is the same way. He will tell me he is eating. There is no food in the refrigerator. There is no smell of food when I come home from work. There are no food scraps in the garbage.  Exactly what makes him think I am falling for his lies?So, I am learning to not ask questions, to understand that I will not get a truthful answer, and to not upset myself by searching for the truth.  Really, I already know the truth. He is exercising without eating.  He is not eating.  Proving this to myself just upsets me.

I am trying to take the al-anon approach of detaching with love. This means being responsible for my own welfare and making decisions without ulterior motives or the desire to control my husband's behavior.  My sanity needs to be preserved.  I cannot respond with anxiety.  I cannot control.  I am not responsible for the behavior of my husband.  I am only responsible for my behavior.I wish I had a husband who was not mentally ill, who treated me better, who put effort into the health of the marriage.  I do not have a better marriage.  Right now I am making the choice to continue with what I have.  But every day, I make sure that I am aware it is my choice to stay and I have options.  This helps me in the detach-with-love department.",WornOutAndNumbH...,"Thu,05/23/2019-6:36am",It's now been 7 weeks since I,"It's now been 7 weeks since I confronted my wife about her ED. She's still not talking to me.
She planted flowers in our front yard last week. I commented that they look nice. I got no response. A day later I asked her about the evening she spent with our married daughter. She grudgingly mumbled they had a good time. Her hatred and resentment toward me is off the charts. How dare I shine light on the secret lie she wants to keep hidden.Our daughters tell me she's very upbeat when she goes to their house to see them. She brings home baked cookies and cupcakes for them and the grandkids. Of course she doesn't eat any herself. She's manipulating them like she did me for years. She's building up brownie points with them for the eventual day we get divorced. She doesn't know our 3 daughters are tired of her ED and they've been keeping me up to date on their conversations.I don't want a divorce but evidently she does because she asked me last night if I want to file or if she should. I said neither, and she walked away.
This whole thing has escalated to new heights in her mind. She's willing to risk everything to keep her life with ED going. She doesn't work outside the home...so how does she think she's going to support herself. She currently has a cushy lifestyle. She's willing to give all that up.Our daughters don't like arguing with her face to face. My wife is able to think on her feet much more quickly during an argument. She'll lie and stretch the truth in order to win and get people to back off. So I think it's time to have my daughters get together to write and sign a letter to her. Two of them are ready to do it.

Ironically after reading some posts in this forum, I realized a different angle into what my wife is afraid of. That little demon inside her named ED is freaking out that someone is going to pull him out of her. I updated my daughters yesterday about my wife's question to me whether I want to file for divorce. They were floored. One of my daughters contacted her pastor about how to handle getting help for my wife. He asked if we saw any spiritual fruit from my wife. My daughter said not lately. I don't see any either. She doesn't realize she's living in sin by hurting her body and being ungrateful for what she has. She thinks she doesn't deserve to be loved nor forgiven. So she has a hard time allowing others to love her. She keeps people at arms length and over time her world becomes a lonelier place.My daughters agreed its time to write their mother a letter. The tone will be rooted in love. It will be based on what the Bible says without an accusatory message.
Yes there are a mountain of issues from the last 15 years that could be brought up. But that's not going to help achieve our goal of her accepting the fact she needs help.The letter will be written by my daughters and reviewed with me. Next week Friday they are coming over with their husbands with the letter. Since my daughters won't be able to get through the letter without breaking down, I will be reading their letter to my wife in front of everyone. She will be told I didn't write it.

This is the big lie that EDs tell them, at least in the beginning, that is.   I suspect that she understands that things are considerably less than perfect now, though. Once the person realizes that they're in a trap of their own making, as you've seen, things can start feeling pretty unsettled for them.  It's likely she may say that ""You just don't understand.""   Which…she may be right about that.  This stuff rarely seems to make logical sense .  If you were to ask her to explain it to you…she might not be able to do it.  Sometimes it takes a whole lot of therapy for the person to figure the ""whys"" out for themselves, so you may not want to pressure her on that.

23,idontknowanymore,08/29/2019,Girlfriend's parents are keeping her from recovering ,"So. My girlfriend is 22 years old and live with her parents. I'll begin by saying that she probably can't move out yet. First of all there are economical reasons and due to the society/country she lives in, and secondly she's not ready to live alone because of her eating disorder. This something she has even stated on her own. Unfortunately I can't move in with her yet either, mainly because we are long distance at the moment and live in different countries and therefore see each other just a few times a year. The parents of my girlfriend are very controlling parents and probably even verbally abuse. They also kinda treat her like a 12 year old. I'm pretty sure that they are the main reason why she has an eating disorder (and other mental health issues) to begin with. I should probably mention that her mom also has en eating disorder, but I don't think she's getting any help for it at all. My girlfriend is in therapy though, which is even paid by her parents. It all started when my girlfriend was just 8 year and her parents put her on a strict diet. She was only allowed to eat certain things, had a lot of forbidden foods and was told that she's fat. This is still going on today. Despite her age, her mom tells her what she can and can't eat. She's also only allowed to eat within certain hours. A few weeks ago she caught my girlfriend eating chocolate with my friend and didn't speak to my girlfriend for a week, and my girlfriend was devastated and felt so invisible and worthless. She has also been forcing my girlfriend to exercise the whole summer. Thank god her mom is starting work this week after having vacation for weeks. When they were at the beach she wouldn't let her lay in the sun or relax in the water. Instead she was forced to swim for hours. When they were in the park she forced her to always jog or do exercises on the ground. All this exercise. Her mom will also say things like ""You're fat"", ""you have to eat less"", ""you would be so pretty if you weren't fat"" and ""When I look at you I feel like crying"". Her mom is the one who mainly does and says the things, but her dad isn't doing anything to stop her so I guess they're both the ""bad guys"". This is a terrible situation especially since she lives with her parents and can't move out yet. She has told me that she wants to recover and is seeing a therapist, but obviously her parents' behavior are keeping her from recovering. I'm so afraid because their behavior is affecting her so much. Partly because their restricting rules and comments are affecting her directly, but also because she wants to like her mother says to avoid hearing the abuse. I don't know what to do. If she goes against their rules and ""rebels"" they will just punish her some way, that's what they do. They're abusive and extremely controlling. As I said: they treat her like a 12 year old. But worse. I want to be there for her as much as possible and maybe even find some advice for her to make her suffer less. If anyone has any advice or comment then I'd appreciate that a lot.",BobJ48,"Thu,08/29/2019-7:38pm",Girlfriend's Parents.,"Hey there,I'm so sorry that your girlfriend is having these problems with her parents.  It's hard to say what the problem is with her mother - She doesn't seem willing to allow your girlfriend to live her own life.  I wonder how her mom will feel when her daughter finally moves out ?Good that she is getting therapy though.  Hopefully she is discussing these matters with her therapist, and is receiving some support that way. It's not unreasonable for your GF to want to have a good mother, and perhaps by obeying her mother's every wish, some part of her believes that her mother will finally come to see her as an acceptable child.   While I'm not close to the situation like you are, from what you've said it seems that nothing will ever turn her mother into the person that your GF wishes she was, no matter how much your GF may try and please her.   This can be a hard reality to accept, but it may be a truth that she will finally have to accept, if she is going to break out of this damaging cycle of involvement. You mentioned that your GF does not feel ready to live alone, because of her eating disorder.  But how much better is her ED likely to become if she continues to live with her demanding and controlling parents ??She's fortunate to have a sympathetic boyfriend like yourself.  She may need your encouragement though, if she is ever going to take the risks that she may need to take, if she is ever going to break free of this toxic involvement.Keep writing ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,idontknowanymore,08/14/2019,I feel so angry and hopeless ,"I feel bad for saying this, but as someone whose girlfriend has an ED I'm angry. I'm almost 19, she's 22 and we have been dating for about 9 months and met 1 year ago. At first I was very patience and calm about it, but a few months ago at the start of the summer things changed. The situation has reached a point where I'm starting to feel so hopeless and angry. We are long distance and see each other very rarely (have only met twice in real life), so I can't really be there physically to do anything to help her. I've noticed that she's most likely getting worse. At first i thought she was getting better since she threw up less often, but I've realized that her ED may just have changed its form. She barely eats and still thinks she's eating too much, today she told me she had fruit for dinner. Then she exercises for at least X hours during the day (despite barely eating). She talks all the time about how she ""needs"" to lose weight and is too fat. As if this wasn't enough, she has a family that definitely makes everything 100% worse by calling her fat and telling her she needs to lose weight. Her mom has an ED as well I'm pretty sure, and my girlfriend (who wasn't and isn't even fat) was put on diets when she was as young as 6 years old. This is what makes me so angry, it feels like no help in the world will help her as long as she lives with them. But she can't move out, partly because she's not ready to live alone (bc of her eating disorder) and because she can't afford it yet. I'm witnessing how she is slowly getting worse. She's dizzy a lot (almost every time we talk on Skype) and sadly she faints several times a week. I keep pushing her to get more help, which she several times has stated that she knows she needs. Sometimes she has told me that she was gonna be put in the ""hospital"" (idk what it's called, english isn't my first language) or PROMISED me to get more help, but then the next day she acts like our conversation never happened. One day she says that she knows she needs more help and is willing to work more, then the next day she to says she's fine. I have gone from being patient and hopeful, to angry and hopeless. It feels like there's nothing at all that I can do anymore, like it is out of my control. I'm so worried about her, I want her to get better. It's affecting our relationship as well, I have to admit. She needs MORE help but won't get it. And then there's her parents that are destroying her. I feel like nothing I do will ever be enough and things never will get better. I don't know what I should do.",BobJ48,"Wed,08/14/2019-9:07pm",Angry and Hopeless.,"Yes, those are easy feelings to have alright.  We watch the person slowly getting worse, and although we care about them with all of our hearts, it's seems like there's nothing we can do that will help.  These feelings of helplessness can really get to us, and cause us to have all sorts of conflicting emotions.One thing to keep in mind though - She DOES have someone to talk to, who sometimes she can be honest with, and that's you.  Trust me when I say that things would be much worse for her if she had no one to talk to.  If it were just her and her ED, you know ?  So while it may seem like you are doing nothing, you may be doing a lot more than you know. But you are right; seeing people we care about slide deeper and deeper into their ED can really be discouraging, and that does sound like what's happening to her.  If she's fainting a lot, that's not a good sign, and she's probably being truthful when she mentions that she might have to be put in the hospital. ""One day she says that she knows she needs more help and is willing to work more, then the next day she says she is fine."" The ""Everything is fine"" statement is VERY common with people who have EDs.  They pretty much know that they are in trouble, but sometimes they'd rather not think about it.   That's often what ""Everything's fine"" means - ""I don't want to think about it now.""One thing that's positive in all this is the fact that she seems to know that she's in trouble, even if she can't stop restricting.  That can be one of the things that tells them that they are in trouble - When they realize that they can't stop.  Even if they want to, you know ?Here's one thing to keep in mind.  Getting help is going to mean taking some risks.  That's one thing that you can let her know that you do understand.  Maybe she is not willing to take those risks now, but at some point she probably understands that she will have to.  But yes, there's a lot of uncertainty and willingness to take risks that will be involved, and that's something that might frighten anyone. So when you talk to her, see what you can do to put yourself in her shoes.  Let her know that you understand some of the fears she might have.  Fears that are often not that unreasonable.   Let her know that you understand that she'll need to take some risks, and how that idea might be frightening for her.Otherwise yes, we have to see what we can do to not be so frustrated and not feel so helpless.  If we realize that they see us as an important support person, we actually are accomplishing something important I think.Keep writing ?",idontknowanymore,"Tue,08/20/2019-2:09pm",I appreciate your response! ,"I appreciate your response! English isn't my first language so I'm not sure if I understand you correctly, but this: ""Maybe she is not willing to take those risks now, but at some point she probably understands that she will have to"". Does this mean in other words that she will have to realize by herself that she needs more help, and that one day she will? That's my interpretation but I may be wrong. The last few days have been terrible  (I've been worrying a lot and she has shown a lot of symtoms, I guess) and I really tried to put myself in her shoes, try to be calm and understanding. But I feel like my hope and patience have been replaced by a feeling of hopelessness and a lot of fear. I'm too worried and I'm afraid she needs help NOW. Not a single day passes without her feeling very dizzy a lot and passing out.
I realize that this might be the wrong way to go, but I've told her how worried I am, that I don't want to lose her, that she needs more help and that she can do it. But nothing works, either she ignores my messages about the subject, tells me she's fine or give me  promises that she doesn't keep.
I don't know how to do this the right way.Sorry, I don't even know what I'm trying to say or what I should say. I'm just so frustrated, desperate and frightened.

Does this mean in other words that she will have to realize by herself that she needs more help, and that one day she will? ""Yes, I think it means that.  If she is passing out and feeling dizzy, a part of herself is certain to understand that she can't just keep restricting.
Many people with EDs understand that they are in trouble.  But they are fearful about getting help, because they know that they will have to eat and gain weight.  At the same time, gaining weight will NOT feel like a safe thing to do.  It means giving up control, for one thing.  And who likes to feel like they are not in control ?So she will have to take some chance, and have to take some risks.  I think she probably understands this, but is still too frightened to take the chances with eating that she will have to take. One thing I would not do is to keep telling her that you are worried. While anyone would feel worried, you don't want her to feel responsible for you being upset.  People with EDs don't want to be a burden on anyone, so keep that in mind if you can. If it were me, I'd let her know that you understand how frightened she must be of eating.  And how it must not feel like the right thing to do.  Rather than telling her that you hope she will eat.So that's where I would start if you are talking with her.  Letting her know that you understand that she is fearful.  If you can get her to talk about her fears, then that would be the best place to start I think.   It could help her believe that you understand what she is going through, and that  might help her feel safer about talking with you.

25,sunshine33,08/18/2019,Girlfriend broke up with me because of Bulimia,"My girlfriend who I had known for a while but had been seriously dating for 3 months, broke up with me. I didn't know about her eating disorder before. She told me about it when we started dating and that she had recovered, but expressed her concern that it might happen again. I consoled her and told her that even if it happens again, I will love her and support her.
Everything was going great, she kept telling me how much she loves me and was even thinking about living together. Just then, she had a relapse and she binged. I did as I had committed, I gave her all the love and support that I promised and told her that I am with her.
Soon after, she broke up with me saying that she loves me but can't be in a relationship and that she has to be fully recovered before getting in one. I don't understand this. Is this common with people with eating disorder to push loved ones away? The fact that she loves me but can't be with me. Is this some kind of self harm? I don't understand why a good loving relationship would get in her away to recover. I am hoping that people here might help me understand with their experiences.
She says that she still wants to be my friend as she can use all the friendships but I see her in a romantic way and I don't know if I can see her just as a friend. Don't know what to do.

The pushing away thing. I also work on a board with people who have EDs, and I'm still not completely sure why this happens.  My sense is that they KNOW that you are going to be waiting for them to get better.  Waiting to see them making the effort, when a lot of the time they don't feel like making the effort at all.  Granted, the majority of  people with EDs wish they could be rid of the thing, but on the other hand it's a coping method for them, and often a way that they deal with stress.  Of course, sometimes that stress is over the fact that they have an ED in the first place.   There are all sorts of reasons why people might not want to recover.But they understand that at some point you'll be expecting to see them to put in the effort to recover, and that you might feel disappointed if you knew what they really were thinking.  They also don't want to be an emotional burden to anyone, so often things can seem a lot less complicated and less stressful overall, if they deal with this by just breaking things off.So yeah, it could have to do with their knowledge of the (understandably reasonable) expectations they believe that their partners will have, and to be honest, some of the disappointment they may feel towards themselves as well. One thing you may want to do is some reading.  If you can manage to put yourself inside her head, it may help you craft your responses to her in ways that can remain loving and supportive.  EDs are pernicious problems though, and recovery can be a long and emotional process.  It's going to depend on her own attitude towards the situation.  Your ability to remain supportive can make a difference, but at the same time you may want to temper your expectations, as things like this rarely change overnight.Keep writing ?",sunshine33,"Wed,08/21/2019-10:35pm",Pushing Away,"Hey Bob. Thanks for taking the time to reply.From what I see, she does want to recover. And she actually has. Its not as bad now as it was before. Just one relapse in many months.

However, looking at that she was moving in the right direction and wanted the disorder to go away, I had faith in her and that's why I wanted to be with her and give it a chance. I do love her. I didn't expect that the disorder would go away like that. I know that it'll take time and she has actually made a lot of progress in the last years. I told her the same. She says that she won't date anymore until she is fully recovered. I find it really illogical. First of all, I don't know what fully recovered is. Isn't making progress enough? It is enough for me. I don't understand what dating and finding love has to do with fighting the disorder. I tried to explain it to her that a loving relationship will not get in her way to recover but she won't listen. I am doubting if she really loves me; despite her admitting that to me many times. How can I be supportive if she just doesn't wanna give it a chance.We aren't talking since we broke up.

  See, I'm on your girlfriend's side in the sense that I've wanted to break things off with my own boyfriend for the EXACT reason. He brings up my eating disorder, and it really bothers me. He's been nothing but loving and supportive, but honestly, I just feel that he doesn't need to be burdened by feeling as if he needs to look after me. I just didn't feel worth it. I wanted him to go out and be with other women that are healthier mentally and physically.
  I live with myself and this ED every single day, and I feel as if I'm being forced to live inside a vessel. I have a hard time loving this vessel and I have a hard time seeing how anyone else could love it too. Perhaps your ex's feelings might align with my own. I'm really sorry that you guys are going through this. I honestly am sure she loves you because I love my boyfriend too. I want him to be happy, I just felt as if I was dragging him down.

26,dittoditto,08-02-19,Things are getting worse,"He is barely eating.He has long periods of confusion.  It's hard to talk to him any more because often he doesn't understand and he asks the same questions over and over again. For instance, we were at a store.  I said ""Mary won't be here to work with us today.""  He said ""who is Mary?""  I said she is the woman we always work with, you know that.""  He said, ""how do you know she won't be here?""  I said, ""today is Wednesday and it is her day off"".  And He said, ""how do you know"". And I said ""she told us."" and he said ""who is she?""   It must have been 15 minutes later that he said: ""Mary won't be here today, it is her day off"" like we hadn't just discussed this, and I just looked at him in shock.I grow terrified by the progression of this because the confusion happens more and more often.  His doctor is sending him to a neurologist.  A neurologist will not deal with his eating disorder.So, I wonder: I don't think people stay in marriages where one person has an eating disorder.  What are the percentages of divorce in these situations?How long can people restrict eating before they become very physically ill, especially if they are Type II diabetic?Is mental confusion a sign that the ED is very advanced?  Do people live much longer after mental confusion sets in?Hi sister has dementia, so I'm not sure what the root cause of this is.  I am very tired of dealing with this.

Their vulnerability to health issues does increase, and they can look pretty frightening, but still be up and walking around, if that's what you mean.I'm not well-informed about diabetes, but my sense is that people's cognitive powers can be effected by it, if it's not well-controlled.I'm sorry that the two of you are going though this.

Just as a practical matter, you know ?  If she's able to be objective, she probably knows where these sorts of conversations tend to lead, and how it's rarely anywhere good.

It's true, some people need to gain weight, and some people need to lose, as an aspect of legitimate  of health concerns.  But eating disorders are a different thing altogether. So it's a delemma for sure, but not one that's all that unusual where people feel like their happiness is somehow tied to the obsessiveness part.  And that's not a part that you want to get drawn into, whether it makes her angry or not. Because there are different ways of being supportive, and you want to be supportive in ways that actually are healthy, rather than ways that play along with her ED.

I had thought it would be more like an Al-anon group but it was more a few women coming together every so often to share their stories.

The mothers told stories about how their kids were doing, and we all made encouraging noises, but their wasn't really any sharing of solutions, or even advice for self-help and setting boundaries.It was interesting that even years later the mothers were so traumatized by the whole experience that they continued to worry that a relapse might be caused by common life experiences and they analyzed everything their offspring ate.

While EDs are ""about"" so much more than just food, that's often where the red flags will show up.My sense is that these associations between eating and being in control really etch themselves into the sufferers brain.  If you look at the posts on some of the ""evil"" forums, you can see just how obsessive  and 24/7 that sort of thinking can be.  When their brains are soaking in those thoughts day in and day out, wiring patterns in the brain are probably physical.  Like hard-wiring or something, to an extent where changing the established neurological wiring that's involved in the food/control  association is a really really difficult thing.  And yes, strategies and boundaries.  My sense is these things aren't always hard and fast, and can depend on whatever the current situation may be.  If they are too severe, they aren't going to be effective. and if they are too easy to ignore, then not effective either. My sense is that it has to do with whether the person has acknowledged that they have a problem, and once they do, whether they are trying to recover or not.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about 3 years and have known about her ED from the beginning. We broke up about a year ago but found our way back to each other. Except this time I had lost about X pounds of weight and not ate as much as I used to before. She’s mentioned it a few times that I needed to eat more than usual and has gotten angry about it. About three weeks ago she was institutionalized at the hospital and recently was let out. She came over to my house and afterwards the topic of food came up and she suddenly got really upset. I took her home and unwilling to talk to me she later texted me saying she needed a break from us. We ended up talking about it the next day and proceeded to tell me that she is letting me go because i trigger her because of my weight loss and eating habits. She tells me that she wants nothing to do with me and will not get back together with me unless I gain weight and look how I used to before. I’m motivated to gain weight and all but I have this feeling that maybe I shouldn’t go back to her and that doing this is irrational. I love her and I want to be with her but I can’t help to think this is a weird ultimatum and that her ED has gotten much worse than before and that I’m possibly making it worse.

As you mentioned though, the idea that you should gain weight as a means of helping her with what are her own mental health issues…it's irrational.  It's a sign that ED has still got her under it's spell.The thing is…there are always going to be potential ""triggers"" everywhere in the world.  Skinny girls that she sees on the street or on TV, weight-loss advertisements that are pretty much everywhere.  Learning to deal with normal sorts of things that have the potential to trigger her is one of the main goals of recovery, and she's clearly not there yet. In fact she's allowing herself to give in. While it may be tempting to go along with her wish that you gain weight yourself, as a means to show that you're on her side, the reasons she wants to see this are ED-fueled reasons, and not anything that has to do with recovery.  In fact, as you said, if you were to gain for her, it might simply play into her ED, and not really help things at all.   Because if you did gain, it's likely she'd just find some other thing in the environment that triggers her.The thing is…although she may be effected by ""the new you"", she also knows how crazy it is to ask this of you.  It may not seem that way now, but she knows.  If she leaves, it's going to be like so many posts that you see on the ED boards :  ""My ED has ruined my relationship !""Because while she may feel that by leaving she's taking control,  actually it's the other way around.BobJ",Anonymous452,"Sun,07/14/2019-7:00pm",What do you suggest I do?

The idea that what you do, or do not do, is going to be the factor that determines the course of her ED is an idea that she'll need to get rid of. Sometimes on the ED boards people will talk about what a trigger their (often loving and well-intentioned ) partners are, but once they get rid of them, who's left to blame then ?  While it's true that people can be triggered by things they see around them, ultimately recovery (or not) will  need to be their responsibility, and the sooner folks come to that conclusion, the sooner things will move on to a more honest and productive stage for them. (As an aside, people with EDs can complain that they are being triggered by the fact that  partners gaining weight, and just as often you hear them complain that they are triggered by their partners losing weight.  The point being not that their partners need to change, but ratherthat they need to find a way to gain control over the idea that its other people who are responsible for their ED thoughts and behaviors.)You haven't really mentioned to what degree she seems committed to getting better or not.

Some people with EDs get used to going to the hospital, but for others it starts to wear on them. There's all sorts of reasons why people don't want to recover.  ""I'm not sick enough yet"" is a common one.  The emphasis is on ""enough"" in most cases.

32,ImConfused12,11-12-18,Broken up with. So many questions ,"Hi all, I was broken up with with my by my ex who is anorexic and I'm having trouble coping and I was hoping to get some answers to help me understand better.My gf had been struggling with anorexia since her teens, she also was a victim of sexual assault. she always told me even before we dated that she pushes people away and that I wouldn't want her as a girlfriend. Eventually we ended up dating and her anorexia seemed to be relatively under control. Our relationship for the most part was great she would tell me I was the best boyfriend she ever had and that she was so in love with me and everything seemed fine. Well about 2.5 weeks ago she started randomly talking about things in our relationship we needed to fix or we would need to end it, this kind of caught me by surprise since she never mentioned these issues before. So we both had a conversation and spoke about things that were bothering each other and agreed to work on them.  After that things seemed to be great we seemed more in love than ever.So she randomly texts me one night while was out drinking and randomly ends it. I was shocked and devastated.  First she cited that she couldnt get over the things bothering her in our relationship,  then started talking about how this time of year (when her sexual assault happened) that she becomes withdrawn and pushes people away and that right now shes numb and wants to be alone and that she feels she's slipping back into her anorexia and doesn't want to drag me down. Then proceeds to tell me how I can do so much better than her and shes doing me a favor. And we've been broken up since ive been a mess and she just doesnt seem to care even when i reach out to her. I love this girl ive had a hard time dealing with it. I begged her to let me help her and how much i love her but she just keeps saying she needs to be alone and how depressed she is. Im having trouble accepting the end but more importantly im concerned about her health, i love this girl and couldnt live with myself if something happens to her regardless if we're together or not and know nothing about this disease or what to do. I guess what i wanted to ask is..1. Is it normal for people with this disease push people away when they get too close? 2. Is there anything i could of done to prevent this? Did i not make her feel wanted enough?3. What should i do moving forward? I want to help her and be there for her but she says she needs to figure it out on her own. Its so hard to sit back and do nothing, but i want to respect her wishes at the same time, this time last month we were talking about being together forever and one month later its over and she seems like a completely different person.

So yeah, welcome to the world of EDs.1. Is it normal for people with this disease push people away when they get too close?Yes, it's super common, unfortunately.  I worked on another site for the partners of people with EDs for almost ten years, and this was absolutely the number one thing that guys would talk about.  Things would seem fine and affectionate, and then the pushing-away thing would show up.2. Is there anything i could of done to prevent this? Did i not make her feel wanted enough? No, I don't think there was a lot that you could have done.  And to the contrary, the fact that you did make her feel wanted may have been part of the problem.  Oh they will never get better, and just become a burden on you.  You'll always have expectations that they won't be able to fulfill.  They hate themselves and are simply not deserving of love.

I spent about a week after our break up pleading to let us fix the issues we did have and let me help her. All her answers were short, she didn't seem to care which broke my heart. I was hoping to give her a few days to think things through. When she broke up with me she couldnt give me a specific reason, her reasons were 1) shes not capable of loving anybody including herself and just feels numb stemming from the ED and it being the time of the year of her assault and that she didnt want to drag me with her 2) she said she couldn't get over little things that went on during our relationship (bickering w each other at the bar, which most of the time stemmed from her being hammered drunk, but also other little things that she held inside and told me were fine until the final week of our relationship and which we sat down and agreed to fix them on both sides). And after that things were great for a few days then she officially out of nowhere dumped me over a text message while she was out drinking 3) she told me that she loved me but wasnt in love with me. Which was absolutely devastating, a month before that she would talk abouy how im the last guy she ever wants to kiss and love.A few days later she let me come over to get closure in person. I was an emotional wreck and she showed absolutely zero emotion.  I left and she sent me a text saying she never meant to break my heart and how i deserve better and sometimes these things just happen. Anyways after a few days  of not contacting her she posted a snapchat story ( i deleted her off of everything else) of a song called Thank U, next. Im not sure if she was trying to get a rise out of me or what but it worked and i messaged her and she started talking about how she was mad that i said i couldn't be her friend because i wanted to be together last time we talked and that when you love someone u should be there for them. But ive done nothing but try to be there for her and she barely speaks to me.So i talk to one of her good friends and try to get some clarification and they told me she holds things in too long and eventually the relationship got too toxic for her. Like we had some disagreements but all relationships do, but she didn't even give us a chance to fix them. This shocked me, because for the most part we had a great relationship i felt like.  But anyways he said to give her her space so thats what ive been trying to do.  However then i find out she's been hooking up with some other guy. Not even a week and a half after we ended. I just have no clue how she can move on so fast, or how this all fell apart within a month.  I haven't reached out to her and have no plans on doing so. Im just having trouble supressing the feeling that i wasnt good enough or couldn't make her happy. Maybe it wouldn't of mattered.

But ive done nothing but try to be there for her and she barely speaks to me.""Just to say, this lack of emotion and ""numbness"" is also *very* common among people with EDs.  People with EDs often speak about how much they hate emotions, how much they wish they could just shut them off and etc.  But yes, in regular breakups, people don't normally go numb like this.  It really is an ED sort of thing, and you're seeing it in it's full glory I'm afraid. "" However then i find out she's been hooking up with some other guy. Not even a week and a half after we ended.""Yes, how about that huh ?   But what do you think the odds are that she's told this fellow about her ED ? Pretty darn slim, I'll bet.  So yes : This is your big disadvantage, and why she needs to keep an emotional distance from you : It's because she *did* tell you about it.  By hooking up with this new guy, she's trying to tell herself that everything actually is fine, and that she truly can move forward with life as though there's no problem.  So yeah, it's part of a denial and avoidance thing I'm afraid.  If somehow she does manage to keep this guy in the dark, it's quite likely that she'll then find herself wanting to break up with him because ""he doesn't care about me enough"".  So yes, what is it going to be with her ?  Will she be able to tolerate a partner who knows and cares, without going numb and having to push them away,  or is she going to get pissed off and dump on a clueless partner who doesn't seem to care enough ?  This is a quandary  she's going to have to work out for herself.  Because if she doesn't, she's going to remain a hazard for any good- hearted guy that she hooks up with. I'm not sure what you can do to help with this.  Because if we're going to be effectively supportive of someone, they pretty much have to provide us with something to support, and she's just not doing that at all. If it were me, I'd try and pretend that I'm reasonably concerned, but at the same time, accepting and unflustered.

EDs effect some of the very nicest people, and can cause them to no longer be themselves.  The best parts of her that you saw in the beginning are likely to be her true self, but as you have seen, trying to live up to the demands of an ED can throw even the nicest of people into some pretty dark mental places.  When EDs are labeled as ""mental illness"" one really can begin to characterize the sorts of effects they have on our loved ones as an illness of the mind.  The person finds themselves confronted all sorts of mental quandaries and dilemmas, and in their attempts to deal with them, can find themselves going down some pretty convoluted emotional pathways. Paths that can effect their ability to have healthy  relationships in just the ways you've been seeing.Our own frustrations and feelings of helplessness are normal, and to be expected, and really can throw us into an understandable  tizzy of our own.  But rarely do these responses add anything positive to the situation it seems.My sense has always been that if we can set forward a stance of calmness, where we seem confident and with our feet solidly on the ground, rather than allowing ourselves to seem whipsawed by the latest challenging aspects of their behaviors, that's really going to be our most helpful and effective  position.   Even if we have to fake it a lot of the time. At the same time, no one can be blamed for seeing situations like these as bad business, particularly if the other person doesn't seem willing to confront their situation, and take steps to get better.  ""Taking some steps back"" is not really a betrayal of the concern we have for the person I believe.  In the end, we also have a certain obligation to take care of ourselves, and finding a proper balance in regards to that aspect is an important part of our responsibility as well.",ImConfused12,"Thu,11/15/2018-1:05pm",What are your thoughts?

If she is into drawing conclusions, that is, which to be honest, some people aren't. In the mean time, see if you can put some emotional distance between yourself and the situation.  I know from personal experience how hard that can be though.   Our partner does some outrageous and hurtful and unreasonable thing, and it's natural for us to want them to come clean with us - A desire that is understandable, but which can keep us mentally engaged in ways which are not always good or healthy for us. Who knows how things will turn out, but I think there's a point where we need to realize that while we can still think of a dozen things we want to say to them, the truth is that they can  pretty much imagine what we think already, and we have already done as much as we can reasonably do, and that any changes we see are really going to be up to them.

Because really, healthy relationships should provide both parties with reliable happiness, ease and comfort, rather than being an emotionally exhausting drama. It can be easy to be sucked in by that part, as I know from my own experiences. We can find ourselves wanting to play the rescuer too, which often doesn't work out so well.

If we have the chance to write to them, things like ""I know things may be kind of rough now"" are probably the best things we can say.  Rather than "" I know you'll be fine"" or other reassurances of that nature. But yeah, we can begin to wonder how we are being pictured, when our care and attention seems to be problematic.  Are we overly clingy ?  Are we acting like some kind of stalker ?  It helps us when they can reassure us about this, but that's something we can't always count on, when they find themselves in difficult head-spaces like this. It's like I may have said earlier, they need to provide us with something to support. Something where we can be assured that our support will be welcomed.  As you are finding, it can be difficult to be sure about that, when things are in a confused state like this.In any case, I believe we bring our best intentions in situations like these, and if you begin to question yourself, I think that's an OK idea to draw reassurance from.

So Saturday things were fine until night time. I texted her that I was going out to the bar with my friends and I guess she was at this bar but told me we should keep things casual because she was very drunk and hadn't told her friends that we were going to work on things. This kind of felt like a slap in the face basically insinuating that I had to pretend to just be essentially a stranger all night.
I proceeded to send multiple texts to her expressing how upset I was and how stupid this made me feel, she proceeded to ignore them and when I tried to talk to her she started yelling at me and telling me she wanted to take this in baby steps.  This has been an issue in terms of our relationship meaning whenever I see her out she is hammered and has barely ate so she's almost impossible to talk to or handle. She has been like this alot the last couple of weeks.
Anyways I respect her wishes and walk away and her friends try to take care of her (I offered to help).
But then later in the night she sees a girl I hooked up with in the past (before her) that she dislikes come up and talk to me and snaps on me via text.
Fast forwarding to the next day we text on and off and she talks about how lost and depressed she is and she just doesnt want to talk to anyone and about how she said we need baby steps and I'm trying to just jump back into a relationship and she can't just do that, etc.
So I stop texting back because she claimed she wanted to be left alone and she texts me again last night saying shes sorry abd just in a dark place and asks if I will come over and stay with her because she doesnt want to be alone.
So of course I do, and everything was fine we didnt talk much just kinda cuddled up and slept.  She did have bouts during the night where she would start like kicking in her sleep like she was having nightmares but I tried to help her through it.

If you know what I mean by that ?Personally, one boundary I'd set would have to do with her drinking.  If she's drunk at the bar, I'd not talk with her, or go to meet her there. As you've seen, her behaviors are unreliable when she's drunk.  I know that you'd like to have her company, and be able to talk with her, but from what you've said, things can get out of hand and almost nothing that you can rely on ever happens when she's in this drunken condition.  I'd also set a boundary around texting her.  Say what you need to say, and then have that be it, rather than sending her even more texts if she doesn't seem to respond in ways that reassure you.  Sure, this is not a situation in which you have lots of reasons to feel secure about things.  I understand that part.  So it may seem like the only way to clear things up is to keep barraging her with messages.  But really, you've already told her what you need to tell her I think.  She should know what your feelings and intentions are by now, without you having to repeat yourself, or constantly fish for reassuring answers from her.It's true : She really does seem to jack your feelings around a lot, so it might be good to put in place some of the boundaries I mentioned above.  No dealing with her when she's drunk, for one, and cutting back on the texts, while keeping the ones that you do send succinct and to the point.You may find that steps like these cut back on the chaos.  Which is something you don't want to find yourself enabling.",ImConfused12,"Wed,12/12/2018-1:50pm",Update,"Hi Bob,So we ended up starting to see each other again. Not official but starting to hang out, being intimate, not see other people, etc and to take it slowly. We agreed to put all things in the past and put equal amounts of effort in. Things seemed to be going great for the most part, when we were together we cuddled all the time, she told me how much she missed me and waking up next to me and how i was her best friend and even eventually even started mentioning hypothetical stuff like the future and stuff like marriage and kids and stuff. All this lasted about 2 or so weeks. We did have little things we argued about over text, probably the one that happened the most was i felt like she wasn't putting any effort in, i always had to make the plans or ask to hang and all this. She would also start doing things to me that she was upset i did to her during the first time we dated.  I just wanted her to try more,  i changed my life around and was proving it to her and she changed nothing.
So she went out of town Saturday night and stopped texting me after 7 PM, then went out all night without bothering to text me back. So at anout 1 AM i send her a few messages telling her i was done and how this was one of the things she said she broke up with me for the first time we dated.
Anyway she calls me the next morning and seemed concerned that i was really done. I told her no we squashed it and made plans for her to come over that night, which she eventually sent me a text saying she couldn't.
So the next morning and the next night i responded to her texts very short , because i was a little annoyed,  we'd barely talked eventhough she was texting me first ut took foreverfor her to respond. So Tuesday morning came i mentioned to her it was bothering me and she sent a long text saying that she doesnt see this progressing into a relationship and that she cant see it like she used to and all this. I asked and asked for a reason and all she could say was thats just how she felt. Then i mentioned her bringing up the marriage stuff just days before and all that. But she just kept saying she cant see this progressing and maybe too much damage has been done. And that was yesterday we havent talked since.
Obviously this is my biggest fear because i went out on a limb to let her back into my life after she reached out to me and asked. Now i just feel blind sided again.Was i being too needy wanting her to try harder? Like did i push her away? Just days before things seemed great i was so optimistic.  My mom seems to think she's just manipulative and likes to play games due to her low self esteem.  Its just killing me because i changed everything for this girl and was everything i wasnt the first time i was this time and it makes zero sense. She didn't even try to make it work and mentioned nothing wrong until started being short with her which annoyed her. Any thoughts?",BobJ48,"Fri,12/14/2018-6:04pm",Yet More erratic behavior,"Hey IC12,Yes, her behaviors kind of seem like an ingrained pattern.  You can make changes yourself, and hope that she'll do the same, but your attempts at change  don't seem to be making a difference.  Even the talking you did - It seemed fine at the time, but it turned out that you could not count on her feelings remaining the same, in any sort of way the you can count on, or provide you with a sense of stability within this relationship.   Perhaps I'm wrong, but this kind of does seem like a pattern, and something that you might expect to continue in the future ?It may be that some of this was said to you while she was drinking ?  Some folks can find their personality changing when they drink, so that may be part of it.  But it could come from mental instability too.  Like one moment she views you as this person she might marry, but then later, without a whole lot of particularly negative stuff happening, then she doesn't feel that way at all.  Sure you may have been short on the phone, but that is something that's not exactly this earth shaking event, and yet look at the effect it had.Personally, I'm not seeing that as mindful manipulation, it seems more of a mental situation on her part.  Like mentally she tends to see things in all or nothing sorts of terms.  Rather than there being any sort of in between, like it can be for most people.  I'm not sure how that lines up with what you've seen from her before, but it's something to keep in mind while you are trying to figure this out. If that's what it is, it's possible that suddenly she'll think you are wonderful again…until once again she doesn't.  Which is how it can be with people who's minds operate in this all or nothing sort of way. I may be wrong about all of this, but if she does tend to think of things in these terms, It is a mental style which can make relationships awfully unpredictable, just as you have been seeing.

Is it normal for people with this disease push people away when they get too close?I think so. I've been dating a woman with an eating disorder for almost three years now, and intimacy has always been a struggle for her (not just sexual intimacy, but also intellectual, emotional, and spiritual intimacy). Eating disorders love secrecy. The more secret the eating disorder is, the more it will be able to harm her without anyone else standing up for her. Think of the disorder as a little monster that is trying to protect itself. The monster probably helped your ex cope with something difficult at some point in her life, but the longer she relied on it for help, the stronger it got. It thrives on being unquestioned, hidden, and, most of all, on pretending to *be* your ex girlfriend.2. Is there anything i could of done to prevent this? Did i not make her feel wanted enough?I'm no expert on relationships, and I don't know all the details about your own situation, but based off of what you've written here, it sounds like she didn't dump you because of anything that you did to her. It sounds like this is about something she's struggling with internally. If her disorder is making her so ill that she believes pushing loved ones out of her life will make her feel better, then that's something that she has to come to terms with, not you. You didn't make her eating disorder (or her sexual assault) happen to her and, as much as you might want to, you can't make it go away either. She has to help herself. Recovery is a very personal journey, and it's not your journey. After re-reading your post, it sounds like you might be taking some responsibility for her well-being. I think that's very noble of you, and I think it shows that you love her very much, but I also think it's something to be careful of. You are not responsible for her actions, and it's really important to remember that in hard times like these.3. What should i do moving forward?I think you should do just that... move forward. It sounds like your ex needs to do some recovery on her own. You said she mentioned that she needs to figure it out on her own, and I agree with her to a certain extent. On the one hand, I don't think isolating yourself from others is helpful, but on the other hand, I think that her recovery is a very personal matter and it's ultimately something she has to deal with herself. No one else can do it for her, and I'm hoping that's what she meant.Regardless, I'm sorry to hear you two went through this. As I said, I've also been dating someone with an eating disorder for a long time now, and I can empathize with the feelings of helplessness and powerlessness over these horrible diseases. Just remember that you are not responsible for her actions or for her own health when it comes to her eating disorder, and don't forget to take care of yourself as well. The door might be closed on this relationship (for now), but many other doors have just opened for you as well. Take this time to reflect on who you are as a person and what you want out of your own life.

And honestly not much has changed.  I ended up trying to move forward, I went silent on her.  And every couple of weeks when she doesn't hear from me she'll send me a long text apologizing saying she knows she needs to get help and how much she cares, etc. This kept happening and we sparingly hung out every once in a while (probably not a good decision on my part). Anyways what would usually end up happening is she would say all these things to me and then I would see her out at a bar we both tend to frequent on the weekends, and she'll act like she wants nothing to do with me.  Like I'm some kind of ex that can't get over it.  When she's the one constantly reaching out to me. And then a week or so later I'll usually hear from her and it's the same things over again.
So fast forward to about a month ago, I was starting to move on, we hadn't talked in like a month.  She started messaging me sad country songs that reminded her of us, and another text trying to initiate conversation.  I ignored them.  Anyways I ended up being downtown that weekend and she came up to me and asked if we could go talk.  So we did, she was telling me about how she finally started going to counseling, how much better things were getting and that she feels like she didn't give me a fair shot last time and she wanted to start hanging again to see if we could work on some things.  I unfortunately gave in again, but I told her that she is going to need to be the one putting the effort in this time, because she always said all these things and her actions didn't match up.  Anyways we end up hooking up, going to eat the next day, things seemed to be fine.  So she texts me first the next day, we talk for a little, conversation is fine.  Next day she texts me again, we talk for a little.  She stops responding.  The 3rd day I ask her what the heck is the deal? She says she stopped responding because I was being short (which I wasn't) and that she understands that she needs to put the effort in but I can text her first too.  And then proceeds to tell me that she can't promise this will turn into a relationship and all that.  I told her that I wasn't anywhere near ready for a relationship with her, because things like this have always been an issue, she would say one thing then the next day it's like a complete 180, all the time.  So she stopped responding, we haven't talked in almost 2 weeks.  I saw her out last weekend and walked right past her and didn't acknowledge her.  But I can't help continually feeling like I did something wrong.  And I feel like every time I move forward and she pops back up I give in because I want to believe she is going to go back to the way things were in the beginning.

""Um yeah.  That's kind of crazy-making, isn't it ?   Sometimes you're the good and understanding fellow who she wants to be with, and then other times everything is your fault and you're shunned.  And how long has that pattern of behavior been going on for ?   And how effectively  have your good intentions been able to change it ?It's not uncommon for people to have varying feelings about things, but as perhaps you are starting to notice, this feels kind of different than that.   Because from all you are saying, it sounds the same way to me too. So nobody is a therapist or psychiatrist here  (Which is not really true, because NEDA is loaded with them…but that's another topic ) but some of this sounds a bit like Borderline Personality Disorder.  The classic book on the subject is titled ""I Hate you, Don't leave me"" which is a reflection of the abandonment issues and tangled and flip-flopping inner feelings that people with BPD often deal with. ""  she would say one thing then the next day it's like a complete 180, all the time. ""Well yes.  Which sounds like an example of Black and White thinking.  One day you are the good guy, and the next day your not. One days she feels one way, and the next day just the opposite..  Often without a lot of it having to do with your own actions, and without too many gray areas either.   Because as you've seen, you can try this, and you can try that, and not much of it seems to have much effect how she thinks about you. Unless she senses that you might be leaving for good, that is.  And then the abandonment fears start to eat at her, and you end up hearing from her again.In any case, perhaps it's not BPD, but people with that condition often struggle with EDs as well.  If you notice a lot of impulsivity on her part (rushing out and having sex with that.guy for example) then that's often a part of it too.  Again, there's no way to tell, but reading up on the subject might give you some insights and things to think about, even if it's not what she has.

We like to believe that when we care about people, it's a positive thing.  But if our concern involves an important issue which they'd rather not look at, and which they wish to avoid, then they don't always see it that way. Try not to get down on yourself for this though.

They could have gone somewhere else, but they didn't.   So yes, not particularly mature on her part.   Keep that in mind, OK ?"" i cant understand why i care so much about someone who constantly hurts me and doesn't even seem to care.""Well yes.  And if we had known from the beginning that someone was going to treat us this way, then we probably would not have been drawn to them in the first place.  Right ?But once things start going sideways, I think there's a part of us that REALLY wants to understand why the other person thinks it's OK to act like this !

The whole thing sounds like bad business to me.  Sure, at some point she may try and draw you back in, because she understands that you're vulnerable and she may be the sort of person who's uncomfortable without a fellow who pays attention to her.But I think that you'll want to be on guard against that, unless you want to be put through all this again.

She'll text me first and respond a few times then just stop responding completely... I just cant figure out what the hell is going on.""No, I think you've pretty well laid out what's going on. And what's going on is that...she's the sort of person who acts in the ways that you've seen that she acts. Granted, this is *not* the sort of behavior that we expect from most folks, but on the other hand, it is indeed the way that certain people behave. I could give you some examples from my own experiences, but I won't.  But I will say that I had the same reaction ; What the heck is going on, and how is it that they can act that way ?   The answer being that this is indeed how they act, and you probably can't expect any different, or any sort of apology either.I suspect you may have heard what others have said.  ""Gee, she sounds kind of flakey"".  That can sound overly simplistic I know, but it's kind of how most people would see it.Does this mean that she is a bad person ?  I don't think it has to mean that at all. As you said, at one time she was a kind and caring person.  Which was exactly the same as my friend was. I thought I had hit the jackpot, she was so terrifically nice to me.  At the same time, maybe it's a role that they are trying to play ?  Not maliciously, because I don't believe that, but more that there are…inconsistencies, I guess you could say.  And now this other fellow, and what feels like more erratic and inconsiderate behavior. Folks like her would probably tell you that they are simply trying to get from point A to point B, like the rest of us do. And in a sense they are.  But at the same time, there are probably a number of things that they just aren't prioritizing.  Other people's feelings, for one, and where this sort of behavior is likely to take them, for another. Again, you might want to look into Borderline Personality.  People use that term as a perjorative sometimes, but it's a real thing that otherwise-nice and well-intentioned people can have.  And it often gets them into the sorts of trouble that you are seeing. ""I had this nice relationship with this nice fellow, but then I screwed it up"".  You'll often hear people with BPD say that.  EDs are often an aspect of BPD too, with the BPD being the more important aspect. But yeah, your puzzlement is a common thing too.  Even though I have a lot of experience with this, when I was with my friend I was puzzled too.  And ""Oh she's just flakey"" was never a satisfying explanation, even though it was probably the truth.

35,optimistic,06-05-19,BobJ48,"Hey BobJ48, I have been exploring this forum for answers and it seems you have plenty of experience with ED, so I thought I would reach out to you directly.My ex broke up with me recently because she relapsed in her ED due to a multitude of life transitions affecting her. We were extremely happy, had future plans together, including marriage. Our core values also aligned which made our bond strong and natural. She started becoming distant and withdrawn 8 months in, which I know now is very common from reading your posts. This ate away at our relationship, making our interactions the complete opposite of how we were in the beginning - less intimacy, barely talking, skipped out on vacations and gatherings. While I was aware she had a history of ED, I thought her general behavior was a sign of her losing interest, which caused me to become distant to protect myself.I tried my best to be understanding and supportive, recommended that she should seek treatment, which she did. They diagnosed her as neither anorexic nor bulimic, but she did display patterns of restriction. Since she would hardly eat, she became sick often. Naturally, I was there for her, but it came to a point that it started affecting my mental health as well. We both realized this and I asked her to take some time to figure out if there is room for our relationship to grow. Yesterday, we met up and she broke it off, saying she is not healthy enough to give our relationship the energy to progress as much as she wants to, and that she is actively trying to fight this for her loved ones. As hurt as I am, I am also happy that she is taking action and prioritizing her health. We are both disheartened by it and left it off on good terms with much love for each other. We both know it is what is best for now, even though a big part of me wants to be able to understand and support her through her journey.We had a great relationship, complemented each other, and did not see major obstacles outside of ED. I know every relationship is different, but in your experience do people torn apart by this get back together after recovery? Part of me thinks this is final, but the other part is saying this is just for the foreseeable future. Your insight would be much appreciated. Thank you.",BobJ48,"Fri,06/07/2019-5:39pm",Optimistic.,"Yes, you are right about the withdrawal thing.  I spent 10 years moderating another site that was for the partners of people with EDs, and this sort of withdrawal was the number one thing that partners would show up to talk about.  And it was the same thing - Things would go fine in the beginning, but once the person had revealed the facts of their ED, instead of things becoming more intimate as a result of a revelation that is quite intimate, the withdrawal thing would begin instead. My sense is that it can happen because the person knows that their partner is going to have expectations.  Expectations that they will get better, or expectations that the person actually *does* want to get better.  Which is not always the case.  Often people don't want to get better, or don't feel like they are ready to get better.  So they believe that they'll ultimately become a disappointment to their partner, and will never be the sort of person their partner hopes they will be, and etc etc.   They can come up with a lot of reasons to withdraw, it seems. It's hard to say if people end up getting back together, once the person is recovered.  In my very limited dating experience, it kind of seems like if I've seen a partner behaving poorly, and things break up because of that (even if I am willing to forgive them ) the person usually would rather take up again with someone new who has never seen that aspect of themselves.  Kind of like they cross people off their list who have seen them do things which they would rather that people not know about. I'm not sure that this is always the case, and it does seem silly when two people really do know each other, and have had positive feelings for each other in the past,  but I've seen it happen in my own life, so who really knows. My sense is that if you've let her know that you still intend to care about her, you've kind of done what you can do.  She can choose to see that as a positive thing, or she can choose to be intimidated by it. How people end up thinking about things is curious alright, and all we can do is try and do our best with our half of the relationship.  The other half of the thing will, by definition, always belong to the other person, and is not ours to control.Bob J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,casualflautist,05/30/2019,"Coping, Fostering Recovery ","I met my girlfriend last July and we started dating a few months into college. When she told me she had an eating disorder (a month or so into our relationship) I decided that I was going to work my hardest to be a support for her. I've read a lot about different strategies to be a support and foster recovery in your partner. Some days I feel more prepared than others. Especially the days when she recounts past behaviors such as bingeing or over-exercising.  Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with hearing these things as a partner? They rip my heart open to think about. Additionally, my girlfriend made some pretty significant strides in terms of weight recovery and emotional recovery throughout the school year but now that we've both gone back to our hometowns for the summer she's been struggling much more. She is surrounded by friends who promote unhealthy behaviors to manipulate weight and her parents are obsessed with diet culture.
I'm trying my best to encourage her with frequent reminders of how she doesn't need to compensate for food through over-exercising or restricting her food intake, amongst other reminders. We talk every day and have a lot of conversations about food, her struggles, and her body. I always try my best to make her feel heard and understood. I just don't know what else to do. I'm mostly worried that she will work herself back into the state she was in when we started college. I've read that the most effective recovery tool is therapy so I've suggested that a few times but she's having a hard time getting comfortable with the idea of participating in therapy. Is there any other way I can help her?",BobJ48,"Fri,05/31/2019-9:25pm",CF,"To be honest, it seems to me like you're doing a wonderful job.   Yes, I know :  it's easy to wish that somehow our words, and our ""wonderful job"" will result in the person recovering.  But given how ingrained, and how intimate EDs are, that's probably more than we can reasonably expect from ourself. Even so, that doesn't mean that we're not being effective.One significant milestone to keep in mind is that she's not really alone with her ED anymore.  Someone else knows and feels trustworthy and is being supportive. This really is a pretty big deal, so you already are involved in something quite positive, even if she's still struggling with behaviors, and with triggering experiences at home."" I always try my best to make her feel heard and understood. ""That really is it - That is your role in all this.  When it comes to support, ""People want to be heard and known"" is a phrase that I often use, so it was good to hear you say the same thing""Things must be difficult, I know"".  ""It must be hard to feel in control of things, or to even know what that means sometimes"".  Statements like that go right to the heart of the matter I think.When it comes to the idea of recovery, or the idea of getting therapy, I tend to acknowledge that that's going to mean taking some risks. Because it will, you know?  Things might not work out, they might not click with their therapist.  They'll probably get asked if they really feel like getting rid of their ED or not.  So yeah, at some point they are probably going to need to take some risks for themselves- Risks that (for any number of reasons) they may or may not feel ready to take right now; risks that can feel uncertain and scary.So the risk-taking theme is one that you may want to keep in mind, when it comes to the ""understanding"" part.

as i continued to learn about her journey with ED, i began to witness (more and more) the effects of ED on her body/mind. and it has affected my attraction to her on a deep level.poor hygiene, lack of oral care, very strange/restrictive eating habits, irritability, and other common tropes of ED has really made it hard to stay sexually connected...
at times it throws our whole relationship dynamic off, making us feel like roommates. i love her, but have trouble connecting physically.any thoughts, suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  many thanks",dittoditto,"Sun,06/02/2019-3:34pm",Thoughts on Intimacy,"Hi gsanders,I see no one is commenting on this, so I thought I would give it a shot.In many marriages... even those without ED.... there are periods where one or the other party loses the desire for intimacy with their partner.  In the case of poor hygiene... well, that's pretty big.If you are able to have a loving and gentle discussion with your spouse about the importance of good hygiene, that might help, especially if you can find some type of reward (emotional, or physical, or material) for positive changes. If you can get that corrected, a lot of feelings of intimacy have their origins in our own minds.  Creating fantasies for ourselves can stimulate our feelings.  Sharing pleasant experiences can also help to revive those feelings.Lacking anything working, some couples stay together simply because their relationship meets other needs and they forego the sexual side.  Some people stay together while they quietly find gratification outside the marriage.  And some people simply call it a day and end the marriage.I've found that lacking any sort of ED support system for yourself, Al-anon can somewhat meet the need. People dealing with alcoholics face similar frustrations and issues and their 12-step program can be beneficial in all sorts of situations.  I've also found it helpful to ask the Ann Landers question: ""Am I better off with them or without them?"" and write down your reasons so you have a clear understanding of your decision and motivation.You have choices.  You just need to explore what will work for you.Sending best wishes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

39,Somewhatok,05/30/2019,I feel like I'm losing my mind,"I've never been here. I didnt even know this website existed. I will first apologize if I seem uneducated on any of this as I pretty much am. I've been scouring the web trying to learn and understand as much as I can as fast as I can. 2 days ago I found out that my girlfriend has been hiding her anorexia from me for 8 months. The conversation wasnt an easy one. We were up all night and into the next day. She has been feeling really crappy the past couple months and I've been doing what I can (google) to figure out what could be causing her to feel this way. I was convinced I'd figured it out when I found nondiabetic hypoglycemia. She wasnt so sure. I kept digging and I know her eating habits arent the best so when I found something that mentioned anorexia I thought hmm.. maybe she isn't eating enough and that's causing it. I NEVER thought she'd be showing me a few hours later her calorie counting app with the limit set to X which she was barely ever reaching. For days she would restrict and then binge on (a healthy amount of calories for and adult woman) and then repeat the cycle. We've had A LOT going on the past couple months. Her father (55) passed away suddenly from heart issues that happen to run in the family. We took him to the hospital and he died hours later. It was the most pain I've ever seen someone in. My girlfriend is only 21. Her mother, a real stand up lady, isn't in her life. She'd rather do drugs. She was now an orphan. She has a 2 year old daughter that we both take care of during the week and her daughters father takes her on the weekends. Lately her health has been absolute sh*t. Her heart rate will increase to like 120 to 135 for no reason. She will complain that her chest feels tight. She'll tell me she doesnt take normal deep breaths. She has headaches. Shes dizzy. Shes irratable all the time. She cant get out of bed in the mornings. All of these things worried me because of what we just went through with her dad and the history in her family of heart issues. I urged her to get things checked but she always refused. Now it all makes sense. I'm scared. I cried. Sobbed to her when I found out. I know that's not a good reaction. I know I should have been stronger but I'm so scared. I'm frustrated that shes just been living with these issues and knowing full well why. In a way I have some anger that she let me wonder what was happening. That she knew but continued to knowingly push her body to this point. I told her if she continues she will die. I dont know if that's too drastic to say but it's literally the truth. This disease takes so many. Although I'm hurt and angry inside I cant show that to her. I know it's not really her doing this to herself. I know it's not her fault. Yesterday I made an appointment with a cardiologist. I called probably 10 places till I found one that could get her in, in 2 days. I screamed into my pillow halfway through because I was so stressed. I feel guilty for even thinking about myself because I'm not the one who needs any attention. She won't see a therapist or anyone who will help her with her anorexia. Which, from what I understand, is really important if she ever wants to recover. You cant treat the disorder if you dont address what is causing it.. I feel like if she starts eating healthier she will just become more unhappy as she isn't controlling that aspect and continues to see herself in a negative light. When she talks about it with me she often gets frustrated saying ""you dont get it never mind"" I feel like she thinks this is something that only she will ever understand and that its ""her thing"" or like shes special in that way. It bothers me because I'm sure her reasoning and underlying causes may differ from others but at the root of it all she has an ED and other people do as well and it's not special. She told me yesterday that if she goes to the cardiologist and everything is fine she will probably just keep doing what shes doing. This set me off. How can she know what she knows, read what she reads, see ALL THE FACTS and still want to do it. I see things as black and white. You do this and die. Maybe tomorrow, maybe next week, maybe next year, maybe 10. Is your whole life really worth that?? I know it's not this simple but her life isn't just her own she has a daughter. I dont know how to talk to her because I know I dont do it right anymore. I'm already horrible with communicating. I struggle with anxiety, depression and adhd and this makes things difficult for me. ""I can make all the appointments in the world, I can struggle over every word I say, but none of it means anything if you arent willing to help yourself as well. I cant sit here and watch you kill yourself over this."" I told her this. I shouldn't have. I made it seem like an ultimatum but I know I cant do that. She asked if I was saying I'd leave her if she didnt stop. I said I couldnt because I know if I made that ultimatum she couldnt hold true and I'd have to. I said that her ED meant more to her than I did. She said no. This whole conversation shouldn't have happened. I feel like I messed it all up. Shes so defense about everything if I say anything in the wrong tone the whole energy shifts and we will be arguing about something soon. It's not even about her ED just anything. I walk on eggshells. Then once I've apologized, because I want to make peace, because I want to be normal again, she will come back later and say shes sorry. It's a never ending cycle. I know it isn't her. Lately shes been trying to justify herself and prove to me shes not in any physical trouble. She uses her bingeing to say that her body must be fine she gets nutrients. (Idk if that is true but I know her eating patterns arent okay and I know her heart issues and other signs arent normal) She tries to tell me its anxiety and stress. It's the cigarettes making her breathe weird. Its dehydration messing with her heart. Shes on her phone nonstop searching things trying to prove shes really fine. It sucks because I dont know enough about the human body or EDs to properly respond.Lately she stays in bed long after I wake up and take care of her 2 year old (I love her toddler. I take care of and love her as my own but when she is doing less and less to help out and I'm carrying so many stresses it's taking a toll. I'm doing all the mom things, I'm on the ED research, I'm waiting on her as well as our 2 year old and I'm drained as hell. When the toddler goes to sleep I continue to do whatever my girlfriend needs and I go to bed wishing I did half of something for myself that day.)I want the girl I fell in love with. I dont want to wonder if I can joke around and have a good day today or if I should shut my mouth and see how to act. I constantly miss her even when shes here. I'm starving for her attention and love. I will do anything for her. I will help her and care for her and do whatever I have to but I want to win this. I want to get through. I'm trying to see the light at the tunnel but idk if there even is one. Im willing to give my life to her even if that means I spend it all with not much for myself but I really hope there's a happy ending. That would be really nice.",BobJ48,"Fri,05/31/2019-11:18am",Hey Somewhat,"No kidding, this stuff is complicated, and is often something that's kept as a secret.  It's medically and psychologically serious too, and since so little of it is ours to control, we can find ourselves freaking out in ways that don't always help the situation.
And even if we manage to stay calm, what are we supposed to do with our frustrations, and feelings of powerlessness ?  So yeah, I'm glad you took the time to write. "" When she talks about it with me she often gets frustrated saying ""you dont get it never mind"" I feel like she thinks this is something that only she will ever understand and that its ""her thing"" …""Well yes, it is her thing.  If you ever get the chance to hear people with EDs discuss things among themselves, ""tribal wisdom"" says it's about having control.   Not the sort of control that actually fixes things in any sort of practical way, but the psychologal sense of at least having control over something.   In contrast to having control over not much at all. So yes, when stressful things come up, where things in life feel beyond their control, it's not unusual to see restriction ramp up, and their condition getting worse. ""When she talks about it with me she often gets frustrated saying ""you dont get it never mind"" ""    And really, how are normal people  supposed to ""get it"" when on the surface it seems so illogical ?   It's possible that she doesn't quite get it herself.  On the one hand she may understand some of it, but if she does, she may also understand that it's ultimately illogical too.  Which…can be pretty crazy-making for the person.On the other hand, it's all nice and neat.  The scale goes down = I'm a good person.   The scale goes up = I'm awful.  This sort of black and white assessment can in some ways be a comfort, as it simplifies everything.   But it's also completely unreasonable. So yes, people with EDs often end up depressed.And what about us ?  Trust me, this is not a thing we can hope to reason the person out of.  From a practical standpoint, yes; they should be seeing the doctor in response to real or potential health problems, and its' probably not wrong to put our foot down about things like that.  But as far as the other parts go, much of what we can do is to try and educate ourselves, so that in some ways we actually do ""get it"" about the sort of world that they're living in within their minds.   Because while the person is going to be protective of their condition, on the other hand, I do think that they hope that their loved ones would ""get it"".  And it sounds like you're working at that.Keep writing ?",iwanttolive,"Fri,05/31/2019-10:10pm",Somewhatok,"Hi.  I want to welcome you to the forum and am really glad you did so you can share and get some feedback.  First of all, it is okay to be upset and frustrated.  You have feelings just as much as your girlfriend and you can not pretend that what is going on isn't affecting you.  There may be ways to share that without placing blame, but honesty is so important in relationships and just as you are upset that she wasn't upfront with what is going on with her, you need to let her know that you are scared.  That is okay and she needs to hear it.  And eating disorders to kill, a lot of the times the heart isn't strong enough.  I do not think it is fair that all the responsibility is falling on you.  You do need you time, so if hiring a baby sitter or having her family member help out, something needs to be done so you have time for yourself.  I think it is admirable that you are doing all you are doing but you do need some time for yourself.  No one can force anyone to get help unless that person wants it.  One can be forced to gain weight, but if they aren't ready to keep it on, they may take it back off.  I am sorry she lost her father and her mom isn't there for her.  There is much pain there I am sure.  You have done your best researching and it is okay to be angry that she knew all along what the problem was.  But that being said, she may know it, but not know it.  Denial is Huge with eating disorders.  So she may have all the facts in her head, but if it doesn't get into her heart, the denial is strong and little change will take place.  I was there once.  Dying and sick and in such denial.  I am now recovered, but it took me a very long time to be able to get to where I am today.  You are correct.  Unless one is willing to look at why they have developed an eating disorder, the problem probably won't go away.  I suggest you get yourself a counselor and support for yourself and NEDA can help you with that.  Just call them or chat online with them and they can hook you up with a specialist in your area.  I can tell how much you love this girlfriend of yours.  She isn't ""doing"" this to you.  She has a mental illness and needs help.  But you may have to step back so she gets the help she needs.  That may mean having her find some childcare so you don't have to do all of the work around the house and she may need to know there are things you won't do.  This is not mean, it is actually love.  It she is physically unable to do it, you may have to call 911 and tell them of her situation and have them come out and run an EKG strip on her to make sure she is okay.  She may be angry but if she can not get out of bed, you may need to do something like that.  I am so sorry you are going through this, but I am glad you found this forum.  I hope others respond and you find this support helpful.  Take care.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

41,dittoditto,04/14/2019,Emotionally Drained By This,"Hi.  As an introduction I have been married to my husband for 10 years.  He has an ED.  He is either starving himself or he is gluttonous.  When I first met him, he was in the starvation mode and constantly exercising.For a year his eating was normal, but then he was diagnosed with Diabetes and was very angry and also in denial.  He began to consume huge amounts of food.  I kept taking him to nutritionists and doctors but he refused to listen to what they had to say.  Whenever I tried to have a conversation with him about his weight and eating he became angry and accused me of nagging him.Eventually he grew obese.  His heath deteriorated greatly. He stopped all exercise and watched TV 24/7 for the past 5 years.  Three months ago we went to his cardiologist who offhandedly mentioned that it was only his medication keeping him alive.  This seems to have had an impact.Two months ago he had surgery on his sinuses.  The surgery caused him to lose all sense of smell and taste.  Two weeks after his surgery I had to travel for business.  I was away for a month.  I have returned home to find that he is starving himself and has lost a lot of weight.Whenever I try to talk to him about his eating he starts a fight and claims I do nothing but nag him.  I realize he has an eating disorder.  I refuse to talk to the ED. I want to talk to my husband. I am emotionally exhausted by all of this.I know that until he is willing to do something about it, I can only sit back a wait since I have, in the past, recruited his doctors' help to no avail.  I am trying to prepare myself emotionally for the worst.  He is 66 years old and I suspect he has been dealing with this for over 20 years.His Niece is anorexic and we have searched for professional help for her, only to find there really isn't anything around here.Thank you for letting me vent.",BobJ48,"Tue,04/16/2019-8:14pm",Husband ,"Dear DD,Things like this are really difficult.  And while it qualifies at the least as ""disordered eating"" there's also that old saying ""It's not about food"". ""Emotional eating"" is another term for this, which encompasses the idea that people fall into things like this as a way to deal with emotions. Or inner fears, or existential anxieties.  At age 66 he may be beginning to deal with the idea of mortality too.  Many of these sorts of issues also have to do with the overall concept of control.So really, the root of all this may not have much to do with food or eating - That's just the outer manifestation of other concerns.  Which are being dealt with in an indirect manner.   If you can restrict your eating, then you are exerting control, and if you see the numbers on the scale going down, that's proof that you're on top of things.But honestly, it would be better if he could get a grasp on the deeper concerns, and find a way to address them more directly.  Which is going to mean doing therapy.  Which he may or may not be open to.  And that can be a problem as well. I'm sorry to hear about your niece's problems.  You are right - in some areas it can be hard to find proper help. Plus it will be the same thing for her : How open is she to the idea of being helped at all ?  If she's in the thick of it, then she might not be, but sooner or later she might be, as most people find themselves running out of steam, as far as their enthusiasm for their ED is concerned. In any case, just some thoughts.   If it helps, I hope you'll keep writing. Bob J.",dittoditto,"Tue,04/16/2019-9:41pm",Thank You,"Thank you, Bob.

We can be supportive, but they need to provide us with something substantial to support.It really does sound like he's got things on his mind though.  The issues with his siblings would be hard for anyone to ignore.  As to therapy, it would not be odd if anyone in his situation got help to deal with their feelings about the sibling situation, so if you were to recommend that he get help, then that might be the issue to bring up, rather than framing it about him and his health and his eating concerns.

In the office my husband agreed to eat 1500 calories daily, but whether or not he is really doing it is debatable.But, I feel I have now gotten his doctor involved and that quiets my conscience as I continue to step back emotionally.I have also found a group that meets quarterly for people impacted by ED and I will go to their next meeting.

42,Eli173,04/26/2019,Wife admitted to ED,"I just today found out my wife has Bulimia. She had started strict dieting and extreme exercise about 8 years ago and she started to really lose weight. She would cook meals for the family but then count calories and weigh out every little portion of food. This went on for years and then she had a couple of fainting spells and after that she seemed to get a little better. Clueless me just chalked her fainting spells up to her not eating right and exhaustion. Then she started to slide back into her old ways and it suddenly clicked for me. I started thinking back and I couldn’t believe I never realized that I completely ignored the signs. Fast forward to today, I finally had to talk to her about it for my own sanity as I deal with depression and anxiety as well and it was literally eating away at me. When I told her of my concerns she came right out and admitted it to me. She said that she was really wanting to tell me or hoping that I would figure it out. She also says that she is done living that way and is going to be completely open about it to me but she really doesn’t want to seek professional help. Now I am terrified that she will really try to hide it from me and continue to binge and purge and stay in that vicious cycle. I know it was an amazing step for her to admit it to me without any anger or denial.",BobJ48,"Tue,04/30/2019-12:31pm",Eli 173,"Hey Eli,First off, try not to beat up on yourself for missing the signs. EDs are secretive things, and hey - Doesn't everybody want to lose weight ?  It's an admirable accomplishment, and most people would not find it suspicious, so I hope you can give yourself a break about that part.I can see where you might be feeling some paranoia now though.  Will she continue to be open with you, as she said she would be ?   And what if she isn't ?  What sorts of elements might that insert into your relationship ?  A person can feel concerned alright.Still, I think you have to pay attention to the fact that she's been frank with you.   That took some bravery on her part; bravery that she may not have been able to allow herself in the past.  So I think it's OK to see that as progress. None the less, EDs are often symptoms of deeper personal concerns, so you are right in hoping she might be open to therapy.  While she may not want to involve herself directly in ED treatment, resolving the sorts of non-food related issues that often underly an ED will still be important. As far as the binge and purge cycle goes, it's true that she may still find herself doing that sometimes.  When life becomes stressful, people can fall back into their old coping methods.  But I can pretty much guarantee you that it's nothing that she'll find herself happy about should that happen, even if she should hide it from you.Whatever the case, simply the fact that she's revealed these things to you counts as a positive development, so you are right about that.  Recovery takes more than just admitting to one's problems, so there's likely still more to come as far as her struggles are concerned.  Even so, it does sound like she's crossed an important line, by being OK with telling you.Time will tell, I think, so as matters progress I hope you'll keep writing.Bob J",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,BottledDew,04/29/2019,Please give me advice to support my girlfriend's ED,"Hello,When we first started dating, my girlfriend told me she had an eating disorder. And as time/our relationship progress, I am learning more about what that means/affects her. I want to fully support her and help her anyway I can so please advice or educate me. She doesn't like to talk about her ED but whenever she is ready then she talks about it and explains questions I might have, however I know talking about it gives her stress and anxiety so I don't want to go into it too much with her without knowing what to say to help her.She saids that she keeps a journal where she writes down what she ate each day and she tries not to go over a certain calorie threshold. I asked before if she can explain why she thinks she is restricting, and she explains that she has a slight body dysmorphia and that is why even if her weight is up by just a little bit it stresses her out. And when she is restricting, she doesn't know why she does it but she feels like she should. She also explains that she is used to it and may not want to change gradually when I ask if she could would she want to. She is underweight for her age/height range, and she skips lunch and goes to bed hungry most nights.I try to say things that will help ease her anxiety whenever I can, because I understand that I cannot directly change her mind and would only make her stressed out if I try. So whenever I get the chance I would tell her things for example, I fell in love with her because of her personality and that she will always be beautiful in my eyes no matter what, and that she isn't alone and she can always talk to me whenever she is ready. There's a lot more but I can't think of it from the top of my head.Please help me so I can be better informed and help if possible. I want to be respectful to this community so I apologise if I have missed a guideline. Thank you",BobJ48,"Mon,04/29/2019-10:24pm",BottleDew,"Oh brother, what are EDs ""about"" ?   Lot's of times even the person can't tell you. The general consensus among the ED tribe is that at their heart they are about control.  If you can exert strict control and self-discipline, you can make those numbers on the scale drop.  Seeing the numbers drop is emotionally reassuring.Conversely, if the number goes up…you've probably seen how it goes ; the person begins to feel anxious and out of control.  And that's not a feeling that anyone likes.  The only way to start feeling back in control is to crank down on the restricting again.There's the obsessional aspect too.  Keeping track in the journal - probably she'd feel anxious if there were some days when she didn't keep track.  Things might be slipping out of control, you know ?When she says that ""she's used to it"" that probably means that she can't stop. ""Gradually changing"" is something that's going to feel…like it's just not the right thing to do.  It would mean a whole different moral mindset, and that would be asking a lot of any of us.It's not the same thing as being a control freak though - generally it's centered on weight and the body, rather than people wanting to be in control of everything.   There's the weight thing and the body perceptions, but these are also seen as external indicators of control. And it's all there in black and white on the scale.  Down = good, up=bad.  Self-judging becomes pretty easy that way.So in time of stress or uncertainty (when a person might not feel in control) it would not be uncommon to see a person's ED get worse.Life isn't this simple of course, so you can see why EDs are classified as a mental issue. And yes, for some reason they often seem to get their claws in the very nicest sorts of people. So there can be that angle to them as well.In any case, just some brief thoughts.

44,linds13,04/23/2019,Husband needs help,"I'm having a hard time approaching the subject of ED with my husband. We have been married for 4 years and I knew he always struggled with OCD but he has never gotten professional help. In the last few years his exercise regimen has gotten more and more intense and now for the last year or so he has implemented an extremely restricted diet. He goes to the gym for hours and exercises at home on the days he doesnt. He only eats a few different foods and has made himself ill because of it but won't go to the doctor/treats himself. His OCD is getting progressively worse as well and I notice my 4 year old picking up on his behaviors. I have brought up getting help for his OCD in he past but he refuses and believes he is getting better not worse. I have not brought up ED directly but every time I bring up food he gets very defensive and makes me feel bad for what I eat and for not having an exercise routine. He thinks everything about standard nutrition is wrong and that his alternatives are making him better including helping his GERD. Occasionally he will binge on junk food and it will make him feel ""like crap"" which I think reinforces his habits. His whole life is the gym and food and it is straining our relationship to the point where I think about leaving every day but I just want to help instead of breaking up our family. I am also worried about our 4 year old as she is so impressionable and has been having some behavior issues including resistance to change and knows more about food than any other kid her age I know. I am afraid bringing up ED directly will make things even worse but I know it has to happen. I am also afraid that since he has become more angry/easily irritated in correlation to these things how he will react and part of me fears for safety though he has never given me a reason to feel that way. He seems like a different person. I'm just not sure where to start.",BobJ48,"Wed,04/24/2019-1:09pm",Linds13,"I believe you are right in thinking that obsessive excercise is an emotional sibling of eating disorders.  Even without the food issues that your husband has.  And you are right in thinking that it's mental illness.  It's also the same as EDs from the standpoint that, at least in it's early stages, it can be hard to convince the person that there's ""a problem"".  After all, aren't we all supposed to watch our weight, ""eat healthy"" and get plenty of exercise ?  Sure it takes commitment, but commitment is a socially valued quality too.  So really, why are you constantly irritating him with your ideas that something might be wrong ?  Wouldn't anyone begin to feel crabby with their partner bugging them like that ?But here's the thing - Just as an experiment, could he give up the gym, and eat ""normally"" for say…3 days in a row, without suffering terrific anxiety?   I suspect you know the answer to that, and perhaps that's a question he could think about too ?Just like people with eating disorders, he may feel he's on the road to becoming perfect.  And heck, if we were perfect, then we'd never have to worry or struggle with self-doubt anymore.  And no-one would ever criticize us either. Because we were perfect.   This idea can be big part of the lure of all this. And yet how perfect is it to have one's mind filled with nothing but anxieties about your next workout, and when you'll be eating your next ""safe foods"" ?  How perfect is it to find your partner thinking about leaving you, because you're compulsions have caused you to emotionally detach from your relationship ?Not very perfect at all. So yes - He's going to have to come to the conclusion that there's a problem, and given all the energy and commitment he's devoting to this, that could be a difficult conclusion to come to.Even so, you've seen his growing anger and irritation.  I'm willing to bet that it's not simply because you are questioning him.  Some of it may be because he's beginning to question himself. I can't really tell you what the answer is, as these are conclusions he'll need to come to on his own.  But it may not hurt for you to let him know that the direction things are going is having a significant impact on the relationship you once shared.  Usually it's things like that which help people see the light - The ever-growing list of negative consequences that begin to pile up to a point where they become harder and harder for the person to ignore. So yes, could he quit for a few days without getting super-anxious ?Like most emotionally healthy people could ?I wonder what his answer to that might be ?Bob J.",dittoditto,"Sun,04/28/2019-9:50pm",Hi Linda13,"I am so very sorry you and your daughter are having to go through this.

My now 18 year old daughter struggled with anorexia, has been doing very well in recovery for over 2 years. She is currently out of the country on an extended mission trip. She has had lots of anxiety while away on this trip. Recently her anxiety has been focused on how much weight she has gained (which is real, and not distorted by her). It has been very difficult for my wife and myself trying to work through her issues with her from half way around the world. We are struggling with how to talk to her about her weight gain, without possibly enabling her falling back into her ED. She has said some worrisome thing along the lines of being angry with us for making gain weight while she was sick, because then she was at least in control, and now she feels like she has no self-control and no will-power when it comes to food. She says she is over-eating, particularly late at night, and making unhealthy choices (junk food, sweets etc)when she does it. Trying to talk to her about without inadvertently enabling her disorder is tricky. Any suggestions on how to deal with these issues?",iwanttolive,"Wed,04/24/2019-10:16pm",dumbdad,"Hello and welcome back.  I am sorry for your daughters continued battle with the eating disorder.  it is not uncommon for people who had anorexia to binge eat as part of the recovery process, unfortunately.  It can be very  scary and overwhelming.  As far as her blaming you for ""making"" her gain weight during the refeeding, that may be her way of not owning the need for the weight gain and blaming someone, anyone, you, for the weight gain takes the responsibility off of her and then she doesn't have to accept that she had any part in it and that is satisfying the eating disorder.  She is not able to cope with the fact that she gained the weight, and now she is gaining more and is scared.  She is in a foreign country and may not have support.  I know you are worried about saying the wrong thing, fearful of her turning back to the restricting.  It must be very difficult.  Perhaps you can just listen to her.  Let her know you are there for her.   That you don't judge her.  That you are praying for her.  Ask her how you can help her, what does she need from you.  Ask her what she thinks is going on?   How much longer will she be away?  Will she resume therapy when she gets back?  It seems that she may need that, but I do not know and can not give advice, so I am just thinking out loud as to what may help her.  If she says she has gained so much weight, I would just support her with I understand that must be difficult.  If she asks for specific input then she is giving you the permission to say more.  But just for her to know that you are there, that you love her no matter what, that you are there to listen, that means so much, for me anyways.  Sometimes I don't want any answers.  I just want a listening ear.  A hug.  Someone to say I understand. I hope this helps some.  Again eating disorders take a long time to recover from and it is not uncommon to switch from one to the other.  Especially with anorexia.  The body is deprived for so long that binging often starts one for the body just to get food, but then the deprivation causes the brain to want more food than the body needs. There is a lot to it.  It is as complicated as it is simple.  I hope you find the support and help you need for yourselves and for your daughter.  I am glad you posted.  It was good hearing from you even though things are rough right now for you.  We are here for you and hope you let us know how things go.  Take care,iwanttolive and I am",dumbdad,"Wed,04/24/2019-10:30pm",thanks so much for your reply,"thanks so much for your reply. She is scheduled to be there until mid June. She has wanted to come home, due to being unhappy with her weight gain and other anxiety related issues. We are reluctant to do so, because we don't think coming home will solve any of her problems, and she will be more upset with herself if she doesn't fulfill her commitment. In hindsight, it was probably not a wise decision to allow her to go, but she had been doing so well and worked so hard to be able to go on this mission - graduated early and raised a good bit of the $$ on her own. She will definitely be in therapy upon her return, and we will delay her leaving for college (scheduled for August) until we are comfortable that she can handle being away and on her own.",dumbdad,"Thu,04/25/2019-10:41am",just realized I mis-read,just realized I mis-read partners and parents.

46,Sceptic53,03/25/2019,"Long distance ED, long ago","Hi everyone,First, I just wanted to let you all know how great it is that this kind of support forum exists. I could have done with it a long time ago, when I was with my ED ex. For many years I felt like a freak for what happened to us, and it’s both disturbing and comforting to know it’s, unfortunately, not so seldom.I’ve been needing to tell this story for many years, so apologies for length.When I first met her we were young, I had just turned 20, she 19. We were both on vacation, and I had never had much success with women up to that point. But she was beautiful, funny, very sweet and incredibly smart. I must confess at that point I already noticed the small scars on her arms, and while I was naïve, I knew they were from self-harm. She told me as much, but that it was from her early teenage years. I didn’t push the cause of it, I just assumed it was behind her. I figured what’s past is past.We lived a significant distance apart, and she had a demanding study program. However, we met frequently, spending all of our vacation time and breaks from college together. Those years were wonderful, and we were incredibly close. She was everything I had ever imagined, and more. She took a keen interest in me, and my interests. On reflection, I think she was determined to be the best girlfriend she could be. She was my first love, and I fell deep. Looking back now, those years were like some incredible dream.At some point her behavior started becoming erratic. There were initially small things, petty arguments that seemed to take on a significance beyond what they were. One time we were watching TV and she was staring strangely at some dancers on a music video. I asked her what’s up, and she replied ‘I’m trying to figure out if they’re skinnier than I am’. Things kind of slid down from there. Her self-harming resumed. She started losing weight, kept a diary of what she ate, and when she ‘purged’. On the one hand, I tried to encourage her to get help, on the other hand I was in denial about her illness. I didn’t think that something as horrible as an ED would be disrupting our relationship.Eventually she did get help. She’d gone back home from college and her parents immediately took her to the doctors. There she broke down and was admitted to the psych ward. Visiting her there was one of the most horrible experiences of my life. I stopped sleeping and struggled to deal with the realization that the woman I loved was so close to death. Eventually she regained enough weight that she could be allowed home for the Holidays, but it was too much for her and she ended up with an overdose. I found her that evening, and bringing her to the ER with her father was another dreadful experience. It did bring me very close to her family. We always got on well, but now we had something more.Eventually she gained enough weight to be transferred to a specialist clinic, and there things seemed to take an upward trajectory. I landed a job much closer to where she studied. It would still be a long-distance thing, but we could manage weekends as well as vacations. We had some joint therapy sessions together at this specialist clinic, and I felt we started to regain some closeness between us.However, I was struggling with my own problems. The stress of her ED weighed heavily on my heart and mind, my parents were divorcing, and my grandmother had a neurodegenerative disease. She moved to therapy closer to her home town, and we had planned a holiday together for the summer. On my birthday she called to say she had met someone in therapy, and it was over. One of the things that sticks in my mind is how cold she was during the call. She just told me ‘I have to think of myself now’.I tried speaking to her on several occasions, I couldn’t accept it was over just like that. I felt that over the past year or so I had poured my heart and soul into our relationship. Just as things were getting better, she was ending it. She never showed a flicker of emotion during our calls, which only caused me to show more emotion. This is something I really struggled with. She had always been so kind, so affectionate, and now she was as cold as ice.In the end, I still took that job, still moved my life. It was a great offer, and I was ambitious. We never lost touch completely. I guess I needed to know she was OK. However every time we were in touch there was no emotion from her. I guess it was also difficult for her. Nonetheless she shared some things with me that indicated borderline personality disorder, in addition to her self-harm and ED. I tried to fill the void she left behind with various relationships and affairs.Eventually, and quite unexpectedly I met my wife, and I could finally (or so I thought) let go of my ex. Fortunately my wife is the very model of health and stability. It’s amazing how much we value such things when they’ve been lacking. My wife and I built a great life together, and my career developed well.This year a death in my family caused me to reflect deeply upon my life, and I was reminded of my ex, critical turning point in my life. I started asking myself questions, asking if I could not have done more at that time? What if I had moved to be with her sooner? I am convinced that the pressure of the long-distance relationship was a major factor in her ED. I fear that my selfish need to be with her was an instrumental factor in her problems. I feel terrible guilt for this, for having maybe damaged this wonderful person. I have tried reaching out to her, gently, to try to address some of those issues from the past. I needed some answers to gain closure. She wrote back, promising answers; but these never came.",BobJ48,"Tue,03/26/2019-7:59pm",Sceptic.,"Things like this are a rough deal alright.  I've been though some of those same things ( the mental hospital, and seeing someone we care about continue to go downhill) so I know how trying it can be.One thing that I learned though - Things like EDs have a life of their own.And as much as we wish that it could, the  ""Love is all You Need"" cure is often not strong enough to break through them. I hope you won't question yourself too much about what you could have done differently.  EDs are mysterious, and if we can tell ourselves that we brought good-will, and the best that we could to the situation when we were in that stage of life, then we really should be OK with ourselves about that. I also know what you mean about wishing for resolution.  By writing to her, hopefully that helped a little bit.  Saying the things that we wish that we'd know how to say at the time - It's good that you've done that I think.As far as her getting back to you, it's hard to know about that.  The answers that she may have for you…they still may be too difficult for her to think about clearly.  Or without shame, and emotions like that. But she knows that she has your good-will, and that's still something I think.",Sceptic53,"Thu,03/28/2019-10:33am",The surprise,"Thanks, Bob, for your answer.Remarkably she not only wrote back, we actually talked.
She apologised for how she had behaved, that she deeply regrets so many of her actions, in particular causing me pain.
There was genuine feeling there, but it was also very difficult for her, for both of us.
I wasn't able to broach the topic of whether my actions, our relationship, lead to her problems. I fear I know the answer already.
I'd like to think we could even talk again, but I think, paradoxically, it would be harder for her than for me.
I'm grateful that she finally reached out to me, and that she's doing well.",BobJ48,"Thu,03/28/2019-8:37pm",Regrets.,"Sceptic,""I wasn't able to broach the topic of whether my actions, our relationship, lead to her problems.

As a result, we won't always do everything right, or in the ways which years in the future we might wish that we had.So I think that we have to reflect on our good will instead.  If somehow we were mean or cruel, then that might be one thing, but if we were trying our best at the time, then that counts.""Self-forgivness"" you know ?   Getting ourselves through life in healthy ways can involve a measure of that.

47,MCNewtron,03/16/2019,Exercise ,"My gf has an ED and as part of it she fixated on people’s bodies, mine especially. She’s not actively purging but her diet is very restricted, and she’s grappling with this whole ‘control’ issue. To complicate things she has epilepsy and has to eat a certain way because of it, to heal herself (though sometimes I have my suspicions, but I don’t press her on r.) She feels triggered if I work out. I am trying to be supportive, but I feel like I need to hold firm that It is ok for me to work out, and that her being upset about it is a sign of the illness. On good days, I can help use this topic to steer her towards the idea of therapy, on bad days I take the bait and start engaging emotionally on the issue and we fight.Anyone else out there dealing with similar issues? Any thoughts/tips?From reading the forums I know enough to try and stay supportive and calm, and to gently insist on my right to make my own decisions about my body - while recognizing it is a legit difficult topic for someone with ED.",BobJ48,"Wed,03/20/2019-12:15am","""Triggered"" ","Hey Neutron, "" I feel like I need to hold firm that It is ok for me to work out, and that her being upset about it is a sign of the illness….""  It's probably not unusual that she's fixated on other people's bodies.  Other people….if they are thin, then it just proves how able they are to be in control of their lives, and be ""perfect"", while she is either a failure, or just not good enough, or any number of equally negative self-judgments.   The whole ""not good enough"" idea really is a plague on people with EDs, and can be one of the most corrosive influences on a person's thinking. I mean here you are, just chugging away at being perfect, without it being some kind huge self-defining moral issue ( as it would be for her ! ) so no wonder she finds herself getting upset. ""...on bad days I take the bait and start engaging emotionally on the issue and we fight.""Yes, it can be easy to get drawn into issues that become unfortunately emotional, but which don't really get at the heart of the matter.Which is what therapy is for.  And something that should not be your job.   Not that you don't care, but more because you guys have so many other connections..  I'm sure she doesn't like how things can become argumentative any more than you do. So yes, for the sake of the both of you, she may have to start some therapy of her own.  Granted therapy can be risky ( things might not work out )  but she would tell you that she's not willing to take any risks for herself ?Bob J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,beachykeen9,03/18/2019,Anger issues,"Hi, my wife has a binge- eating disorder that 10 years ago became so bad she lost her job. As a mom with a toddler, it made sense for her to stay home with the child. But sHe has enormous debt related to her weight issues that we cannot afford to pay down, which adds to our stress. (Her credit cards, not mine. She does not let me see the monthly statements but most of it stemmed from buying food during her binges. Because they are maxed out, she can no longer use them much.) Now that our daughter is a teenager, my wife is spending most of her days doing self-care. I get our daughter out to school as my wife sleeps. When she's home alone she sleeps, reads, watches TV,  makes political Twitter rants,  does daily yoga, and visits with her mom or aunt. She takes an Uber for her daily food shopping for herself to make her own special meals, as part of her food ritual, while I cook for my teen and myself when I get home from work. Sometimes she picks up freelance work. When she has income coming in from occasional side jobs, I don't know how much she is bringing in, vs. how much she is using it at the drive-thrus and convenience stores. But she also says she hasn't binged in a while and I trust her that she is telling me the truth. However, she is using the money for Ubers and for her meals. We argue a lot about how I believe that she could work from home or outside the home and earn enough to pay her credit bills, while she says she needs to focus on her recovery. I'm not sure if this is truly valid. I'm not calling her a deadbeat. I'm just not sure she is pushing herself enough, and being realistic. Or maybe she is smart enough to know her limitations. Again, I'm not sure. We equally do the housework. She takes our daughter to appointments, and I attend school events and meetings. She is a responsible and loving parent. I'd say more than 75 percent of her day is dedicated to creating a calm atmosphere for herself, or reacting angrily when something minor disrupts it (traffic, a thoughtless neighbor, a barking dog, breaking a dish.)  I love her, and I don't mind that she spends much of her time with self-care. But the creditors call daily. We have discussed bankruptcy, but can't afford the legal fees to do this. And anyway, until I'm sure the credit cards won't be rung up again, I'm reluctant. Her dad has bailed her out several times financially, and the credit cards fill up again. We talked about canceling the cards, but she hasn't done it yet for fear of an emergency. I could work weekends to pay off her bills, but I don't want to do that right now. I want to spend time with our family before our daughter goes off to college.This year she seems to be doing much better with her own self-control, but she is extremely sensitive and this leads to many arguments. I think i understand that it has to do with anxiety and depression and self-esteem issues but when we have an argument, she knows all the buttons to push to get me angry. For example, if I say, not angrily, 'Did you pick up my dry cleaning?""  She might say, ""I forgot, why are you so critical, why do you have to ruin our night?"" I will say that i'm not angry,   she's blowing this out of proportion,  and then over several hours, she then brings up 10 or 20 issues she has with me, most of them invalid, or I say that we can discuss those other issues another time, I just want to stick with this one issue, or end this argument. When she keeps pushing me, telling me how selfish I am or mean to her, eventually i get so angry that I bring up the 10 years of her illness and the effect it has had on us, that she needs to seek out more support. Sometimes in anger I call her selfish.  When I'm thinking more clearly I believe she throws a lot of stuff at me to deflect problems she has with herself, and that she is testing me to see if I will leave? Like,  saying ""See? I knew you didn't love me! I knew you resented me!""  Eventually she calms down and apologizes. But I'm left shaken.I hate it when our daughter hears us argue. And it is true, when i'm pushed I can't forget that my wife's actions have greatly impacted our family. We talk about seeking couples counseling, but I think she should first seek help, and then once she has someone else to work out issues, she can then bring up what she and her therapist have discussed at our co-meeting? But she doesn't want her own therapist. She says she has tried therapy but no one understands her.  SHe says as her partner I should be able to listen to her vent, understand her problems, etc. I keep saying I am not a therapist. But it feels like an endless cycle. If she isn't willing to seek help on her own. I cannot force her, because she won't be receptive to it. And we have both heard the adage ""by the time you're headed to couples therapy, the relationship is probably over."" I'm so tired of being the ""pillar of strength."" She keeps asking me to be more patient, and I try.  I don't want to end our relationship. I love her, and she still has a lot she contributes to our relationship when things are good; then some times I say I'm done, and she pleads for me to not leave, and that gives me hope and I stay.  I know it's a disease, but I'm frustrated that she isn't doing everything she can to make this better.  She may indeed be so exhausted with her own self-care, that she doesn't have much left for us. My therapist says that I should expect her to seek out her own support, that she is indeed testing me, that I am a husband and not a therapist, and because she is keeping me away from her financial side of things, she is being passive aggressive, not accepting responsiblity for her actions, and should seek out solutions to deal with her credit card problem.  But I don't know enough about ED and I'm not sure my therapist does either, so I thought I'd post this here for your feedback. Any suggestions?",BobJ48,"Tue,03/19/2019-11:49pm",Beechy,"It's a difficult situation I know, and at the risk of going for a simple answer, I'm going to agree with your therapist.  Granted, she may be working hard at creating a self-caring atmosphere at home, but that may also mean that she's not doing the hard work of confronting her issues.As was also said, it's hard to avoid the responsibility issue.  Not so much for the financial aspects, but as far as recovery goes.  On the one hand, I know that you don't want to shame her, but at some point she's going to have to take the bull by the horns with this.  Which means the possibility of her failing, of course.  She could see a therapist of her own, and things still might not work out.  So it will mean being willing to take some bigger risks than she's taking right now.And you are right - There's just so much you can do, and trying to be her therapist is not one of those things.   The two of you are too close, for one thing, plus you have responsibilities of your own to attend to.  She may claim that no therapist can understand her, but that's taking things a little too far I'm afraid.  Eating disorders are not all that uncommon, and the inner issues that people with EDs struggle with are often the same.  She may be right in thinking that ""no therapist can understand the ""I can't do it"" ""  part, but a good one will understand that part too. So I think you are right about her needing her own therapist.  Someone who's not yourself, and not with the sorts of entanglements and deflections that come with sharing a home life with that same person.You'll want to watch out of the shame thing though.  She probably feels a lot of shame as it is.  How she ends up resolving that shame is going to involve dealing with the whole of the issue I think.  The idea of seeing things straighten out may feel overwhelming to her, but taking some risks in getting help for herself may help her feel a little more hopeful as well.

49,FlowerRibs,03-08-19,Feeling more like a therapist than a partner,"My girlfriend of two years and I have just gotten engaged. I have known from the beginning that she is in recovery from a very serious eating disorder that she spent years in inpatient therapy for. She suffers from bipolar disorder and an exercise disorder as well as anorexia. I love her. I am absolutely thrilled that we’re getting married. However, I sometimes feel incredibly exhausted by having to assist with food decisions and offer comfort constantly. During the week we have started to meal prep, and I think this change may have impacted her in an extremely negative way. I don’t know what to do. She spends a minimum of three hours a day in the gym and still panics when there’s a minor change in meal plans. If we are not physically together, she will text me and ask what she should eat or talk about how much she hates herself for eating a snack. It hurts to see her hurting but I have no idea how to help. Because we’re both women, it’s also hard to find a way to comfort her that eating is okay when we look very different. She is very athletic and frequently runs 5Ks. I am an art student that is not particularly thin or fit. I worry that she resents me for not being concerned about my weight. I have had issues with disordered eating in the past, but I no longer struggle with this very often and find it easy to redirect myself into healthier coping mechanisms. I worry that our relationship will fail because I can’t handle the constant pressure to be a therapist and a partner. I plan our meals for the week so she doesn’t have to, help her make decisions about all of her meals, and comfort her when she is upset (which is all the time). I don’t know how to help her.",BobJ48,"Wed,03/13/2019-11:26pm",Flower Ribs,"Dear FR,This is a tough situation alright.  But the first thing that stood out to me is that she doesn't seem to be making an effort to get better. Granted, by being so dependent on you, she's admitting that she needs help, so there's that.  But by seeming to put so much of the responsibility for her well-being on someone else, that's not really the most healthy thing.  You mentioned that she'd been inpatient before, and while that's not always the miracle cure, most people come away from that experience with a pretty good idea of what will be required of them to get better. And it's true - When we love someone, and they're in trouble, we want to do all that we can to help them. So I can understand why you'd want to assist her.  But from what you've said, she's not making a whole lot of effort to help herself.  I hate the term ""enabling"", because we should try and help those we love, but even so, maybe there's a bit of that going on ?   Not on purpose on your part of course, but it does sort of sound like she's putting you in that position. So I guess I would ask what the plan is ?  Does she actually have a plan to get better ?  I work on some forums for people with EDs, and it's really common to hear people admit that they don't want to get better.  Or that actually they want to relapse. Or the idea of gaining weight remains unacceptable to them.So...have you talked with her about what her plan is ?  Because if she intends to continue to keep working at staying thin ( I imagine she's weighing herself at the gym) then that's something you deserve to know.Because  it sounds like you guys need a plan, and one which involves her taking some measures of responsibility for her recovery.Perhaps even she would admit, while it's OK for you to be supportive, you can't be expected to be responsible for that. Keep writing ?",MCNewtron,"Sat,03/16/2019-3:02pm",You are doing a great job!,"Hello FR,It sounds like you are a very supportive and calm partner so kudos to you for that. It is difficult to be leaned on in this way and sometimes you have to take a break for a second and remind yourself that you are doing a great job. You are doing as best as you can, and nothing more can or should be expected of you. Sometimes if I am feeling in a similar place w my gf I will bring it up in a gentle way - nothing accusatory just the simple fact and honest truth of how you are doing. You have an internal life, emotions, and your own recovery as well. Sometimes I also have to remind myself I am dating someone with an issue and that I can’t engage or be drawn into every thing. Your partner can’t expect you to be perfectly patient all the time. And if she can’t cope with that idea, then that’s something you need to talk about, because that is not good thinking for recovery.Does your partner have a big support network? Sounds like she should use it more. If she doesn’t, it may be good to have her or help her find a way to enlarge it, esp. if she isn’t already meeting regularly with a therapist- that should be happening.Keep on fighting the good fight FR. You are strong and you are not alone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,snowflake13,02/26/2019,"Think my niece may have eating disorder +anxiety,help.","My niece is 11. I know she is dealing with anxiety for sure,but I also believe she may be dealing with an eating disorder. My niece has mentioned to my sister that she doesn't want to get fat. She is very thin,either a bottom of weight scale or below. The last few times she eaten and I've seen her,she disappears into the bathroom. She constantly says she feels dizzy,her tummy hurts,tummy hurts after eating. She gets moody sometimes,ive seen her breakdown and cry over not doing something properly,in her eyes. My sister knows she has anxiety but feels there is something medically wrong,but does not think there's any eating disorder. Pediatrician said so has a school avoidance/anxiety issue and to get her into group councilling.Up to Dec last year from beginning Sept,she had missed about 25 days of school.I don't know how to help. I've talked about the councilling and how thats good idea. I mentioned the eating disorder which she fluffed off. She thinks the doctors are nuts,she said there only seeing the anxiety and not looking for anything else medical wrong,which is what my sister feels.She said if her daughter feels rotten,shell keep her home,even if she ends up flunking,and everyone can kiss her butt.I get to the point I almost feel I'll be attacked verbally if I mentioned anything more. She has not still inquired about the group councilling. I just don't know more how to help.My sister will complain to me here and that,but if you don't support her thinking or opinions,she just doesn't want to here it. I'm afraid its just going to keep getting worse and worse and its a ticking time bomb.Anyone have any suggestions as to what more I can do,besides just be here to listen,cause she won't listen to me or my opinions.",BobJ48,"Tue,02/26/2019-9:13pm",Back to you.,"Well nobody wants there to be ""a problem"", particularly not parents, so it may not be unusual that your sister is not particularly interested in hearing your opinions.   Maybe that's just human nature ?  But as you've said, it's quite possible that there is a problem. And yes, EDs can definitely begin at young ages like that.  And even younger.  Anxiety can lead to things like EDs.  Perfectionism can be a big factor too.  While it's not fair to diagnose things from a distance, it's easy to wonder how she might respond to the questions on the NEDA screening questionnaire. When you are responding to your sister, I know it's been difficult, so rather than giving advice, you might want to take a different approach.  One that helps her figure out things for herself ?If she complains, you might say ""I imagine it must be hard not knowing what's going on with your daughter"", and see where the conversation goes from there ?

51,Samsara1993,02/25/2019,Girlfriend is struggling with bulimia,"Greetings,This is my first time posting in these forums, so I'd like to start off by saying ""Hello""!My girlfriend, who I have been with for about two and a half years, was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa about a year before I met her. She told me about her diagnosis after we had already been on a few dates together, and I really appreciated that she had the courage to share her condition with me.She has been actively seeking treatment for at least three years. She was in an inpatient program in another city for a few months before I met her, and when we started dating, she was just about to graduate from an IOP (intensive outpatient program). Since then, there have been a lot of ups and downs. She has relapsed several times, but I understand this is often a part of the recovery process, and that disordered behavior isn't always a good indicator of progress in recovery. About six months ago, things started to get really bad for her again, and she decided to go back into another IOP (which she also graduated from). In between all of these experiences, she had been regularly seeing a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. However, this therapist left the company she was working with to start her own private practice elsewhere, and my girlfriend has been affected by this. I guess I wouldn't be making this post if things were going smoothly, but if it wasn't already clear: I'm worried about her right now. I think she's going through a really bad relapse and it's extremely challenging to be her boyfriend at this time.Before I go any further, it might help if I summarize what I understand about bulimia nervosa in general (I'm still learning, as always) and what I understand about supporting someone who suffers from it, and then I'll get into how I'm feeling now.First and foremost, I understand that her eating disorder is not my responsibility, and that it is never my fault if she relapses or acts out on her eating disorder. Secondly, I understand that bulimia thrives on secrecy, and that it is at its strongest when nobody knows about it. Therefore, I don't take it personally when I find out that my girlfriend has been hiding her disordered behavior from me. It's not that she doesn't trust me or wants to deceive me, it's that she's sick and that her illness keeps her sick by shutting other people out. I also understand that, for many bulimia sufferers (my girlfriend included), bulimia is about avoiding difficult feelings. My girlfriend has experienced a great loss in her life (there was a suicide in her family before I met her), and often times her bulimia is a (unhealthy) method of coping with the pain of that loss (among other challenging experiences). As far as supporting her goes, I know that I ought to educate myself on bulimia as much as I can. Therefore, I attended a friends-and-family session at the treatment facility where she sees her therapist, which was incredibly useful. I learned that people with eating disorders have a lot of trouble distinguishing between emotional needs and physical needs (especially when those physical needs involve food). I learned that eating disorders are the deadliest mental illnesses in the world. I learned that the *majority* of people who struggle with eating disorders experience significant recovery with continued treatment over several years (that fact brings me a lot of hope). I learned about what sorts of things can be triggering for someone with an eating disorder. I learned that I can support my girlfriend simply by being a good role-model with my food habits (cooking meals regularly at home, not dieting or talking about body image, and eating meals with her regularly). I learned that one of the best things I can do to challenge her eating disorder is to expose it and point it out for her when I see her talking about herself in a disordered way, since eating disorders thrive on secrecy.I've learned a lot about eating disorders during my time with my girlfriend, but there's still so much I don't understand, and I'm starting to feel exhausted. It's particularly difficult to go through a time like I am right now, where she is binging and purging a lot and doesn't have any professional help (she has a plan to find another therapist, but in the meantime it's really tough).The most difficult part for me right now is the lack of intimacy. I am talking about more than just sexual intimacy. There are many different forms of intimacy. There's intellectual intimacy, which is where we share thoughts and ideas freely and openly with one another. There's experiential intimacy, where we do things together as a couple (like going for walks, going on dates, spending time with one another's friends and family, etc.), sexual intimacy (not only intercourse, but also cuddling, hugging, kissing, and touching), and other types of intimacy as well. When my girlfriend is really caught up in the depths of her eating disorder, I have a difficult time finding ways to be intimate with her at all. I feel like she has no interest in talking to me about anything serious, doing anything with me other than something that doesn't require much energy (like watching TV or napping), or being physically close with me (she will often pull away from me, even just from hugging or a kiss on the cheek). I feel like she doesn't have any energy when we spend time together, and sometimes it feels like all the energy that she typically puts into our relationship is instead being put into using her eating disorder and keeping it secret from other people.I don't want to sound completely hopeless about things. At the very least, I'm grateful that it's not a secret right now. I know that she's been binging and purging because she told me that she has been. I don't know how often it is, and I don't know how severe her condition is right now, but I know that the fact that she told me about it is a good sign, and that it means she is still (at least partially) recovery-oriented.I feel exhausted. I want to support her, but I'm running out of steam myself. Every time she talks to me about her eating disorder, I feel a strange mixture of emotions. On the one hand, I'm relieved that she trusts me enough to tell me about it and that she is open to talking about it. On the other hand, I feel scared that she's suffering as much as she is. I try to listen to her, reflect on what she's said to demonstrate that I understand, empathize with her, and offer feedback in a non-judgmental way, but there's only so much that can do to help, and it takes a lot of my own energy. Sometimes, I feel like the moments where we are the most intimate with one another are the moments where we're talking about her eating disorder, and sometimes that makes me feel more like her therapist than her boyfriend. I'm just not getting the intimacy and closeness that I want from my relationship with her, and it feels like her eating disorder is this monster body guard that prevents me from getting close to her.This is getting rather long, so I'll wrap it up. Here's where I'm at, overall: I love my girlfriend. I know she's working on her recovery and she's made a lot of progress since I first met her. I'm also very exhausted from supporting her. I feel like I'm not getting everything out of my relationship with her that I want to, and I'm painfully aware of the role her eating disorder plays in that experience. I'm not giving up on our relationship right now, but I'm very tired and I feel like I need some support of my own. Thanks for taking the time to read this. I appreciate any responses you all might have.",BobJ48,"Tue,02/26/2019-8:30pm",Hey Sam,"Sam,Yes, welcome to the world of EDs.  They can be just like you are seeing them to be, and as partners we can have your same feelings, and experience what feel like the same sorts of rejections too.  At the same time, I hope that you won't spend too much energy worrying about whether you are being an effective partner or not.  You really sound like you are doing a good job to me. Your GF sounds like she's being responsible too, which is always a positive thing.  So that puts you guys ahead of a lot of folks. So I hope you can take comfort from that part as well.But yes, the intimacy thing.  A whole lot of partners in your position talk about that part.  The emotional withdrawal particularly.  It's one of the most common things that happens it seems. And there are a lot of reasons for that.  They can worry that you have expectations. Expectations that are not unreasonable, but which (in the depths of their ED) they believe that they may never be able to fulfill. As you can imagine, feelings of that nature can put a real damper on intimacy. There's the self-hate thing too.  Which results in feelings of unworthiness.  Then there's the ""shame"" part as well.  Many bulimics feel a sense of shame over their binging and purging.In any case, all those feelings can begin to add up, and can have a real effect on intimacy.  It takes feelings of self-worth for there to be intimacy I think.  And very little of this comes from anything that you did or did not do.  In fact, sometimes the nicer we are to the person, the worse things start feeling to them.  So yeah, it can be a dilemma for sure. Sometimes I think the best approach can be validation.  Yes, I know - We're supposed to accentuate the positive.  But I think it can be of help to the person if we let them know that we understand all the negative things that they may be feeling about themselves too.  In a sense, discussions about things like that are a very intimate thing too.Keep writing ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,hbintheam,02-11-19,Need someone to talk to about relationship advice and upcoming wedding culture anxiety,"I'm in a 3+ year relationship with someone who's in ED recovery. I proposed over the winter and we're planning on getting married in January of next year. My fiancee has had problems with restrictive eating and bulimia in the past (bulimia more so in the distant past). She has gone through in patient therapy before we started seeing each other and for the most part is good about managing her disorder. She has seen how destructive it can be and how it affects her health. After a year of us dating each other, she had to have her gall bladder removed. The doctors were all confused why a healthy young woman would have so many gall stones, but it made more sense with her history of ED. There are of course the bumps along the way and triggers to watch out for though while she's managing.This past week has been a hard one for a few reasons.There's definitely added stress and anxiety because of the upcoming wedding. She's in good shape but wants to make sure she's toned and looks good for the big day. We work out almost 5 times a week together, but are planning on joining a gym together too. She says that working out helps her feel more comfortable with eating less restrictively. We both know the next year will be hard with her dealing with these feelings and being pulled into the wedding beautiful bride/shedding for the wedding culture. But I'm definitely worried about her getting too obsessive.She also had her first real period recently because of a lapse in birth control after not having one in years. Her periods make her hungrier than she normally is, so that's always a hard thing for her to deal with while being hormonal. I accidentally triggered her last week and again last night and we had talked about how those were both contributing to her feeling more sensitive with her food issues. From there, once her ED has been triggered, it really puts a lot of stress on our relationship. I know that when we fight or have conflicts, we don't handle them in a healthy way. A lot of the time it ends up with her telling me what I did wrong, how I was thoughtless or careless, I didn't put her feelings first. And she's right. I have my own emotional development and communication issues that stem from my midwestern upbringing and an anxiety disorder I've been managing since junior high. She's had years of therapy and is a much better communicator and way more emotionally matured. Because of this, I always feel like it's my faults being pointed out while I try to look past hers because they're things that I can live with or they don't bother me that much (midwestern upbringing at work). I also too often try to defend myself or push the blame for something onto circumstances that were outside of my control. I realize I need to get myself into therapy to help deal with these issues. But when her ED is triggered by something I said or did, some of the bad habits of our general conflicts end up affecting how we each feel in the aftermath. She withdraws, gets quiet, verbally combative. She's embarrassed by her ED and hurt that I was so careless with my words or how I responded to something. I realize I did something wrong and apologize. We talked about this last night and I've begun to realize that rather than me trying to comfort her and help her through this, asking what she needs/how I can help... I instead just apologize and beat myself up following her around looking for her to forgive me and say it's all ok. She has issues with her temper and when I try to apologize, take the blame for what I said/did, she sometimes reacts badly and says hurtful things or throws it back in my face. Then I feel worse and keep trying to apologize and tell her how terrible I feel about what I did to her. Last night we talked about how this is so painful and difficult for her because she is the one who's struggling with ED. She knows I'm not to blame and I didn't try to trigger her, but she wishes I was more careful and thoughtful. But she's the one who's in pain. She's the one who's struggling with her brain fighting her body's instinct to eat. And me feeling terrible for how she's feeling and beating myself up over it makes her feel even more guilty about it. And then she has to be the one to say 'I forgive you, it's ok. I'm not mad anymore.' It should instead be me trying to comfort her and help her through this issue when her disorder acts up, but it's her having to wave her hand to make me feel ok while she's feeling broken herself. This is all stuff that she had to communicate to me rather than me learning on my own. Which adds to the same problem of her having to help me while she doesn't even have the ability to help herself. I realize I need to do more to help her in these times and be a supportive ally. Last night and this morning I've been writing myself notes so I have something I can read over to remind myself of all of this. So i can keep what she's said will be helpful when she's triggered more front of mind and hopefully react in a more helpful and thoughtful way in the future. I hate that I now feel I need to give myself a cheat sheet on how to deal with it, but I feel like I've triggered her so many times and once I do, I feel like I'm walking on egg shells waiting for her to blow up. I need to be better with how I react in these situations and try to better give her help in ways she's told me would work better for her. At this point she's really disappointed and frustrated with me since I haven't been great in these situations for pretty much the duration of our relationship. I really have to start better showing her that I care about her ED, her triggers, what she needs to start moving through a flare up. I'd love to hear any advice on how to help her manage through the build up to wedding season, things for me to keep in mind during ED trigger fall out, any recommended reading, or just even little ways you show your partner that you care and you love them and want to support them. I really feel terrible that I haven't been a better partner, and I know I need to step up.Thanks for being a place for me to finally open up about some of this. I haven't really shared a lot of this with anyone and it's nice to have an outlet to unload at least some of what we've been going through.",iwanttolive,"Tue,02/12/2019-9:40pm",hbintheam,"Hi. Welcome to the forum.  I am glad you reached out and explained your situation so well.  I first want to say that you are not responsible for your girlfriend's behavior, regardless of her being triggered.  It is her responsibility to take care of herself and not blame you for why she is acting on behaviors.  That is very unfair to you.  It is also not fair that you should always be second guessing yourself and always being afraid of saying the wrong thing.  That is not a very comfortable way to be living and being in a relationship.  You need to be able to be you and not be fearful of setting your girlfriend off.  I am not saying that she doesn't need help and is capable of not using behaviors, but to blame you, this is wrong and unfair.  That you are always apologizing and her expecting that is unfair to you.  You are in this relationship together.  Things she does affects you, things you do affect her, any relationship is that way.  In fact I just had a long conversation with my roommate on this very issue.  How our ""stuff"" affects one another.  I am sorry your girlfriend is suffering and is seemingly so easily triggered.  Could you perhaps go to some pre marital counselling and try to work some of these things out?  I would hate to see you always being the brunt of her anger, her use of behaviors and you feeling responsible for her and her illness.  She is responsible to take care of her illness.  You can love her, be kind and respectful and if you know something that you say bothers her, to try not to say it, but everyday conversation, having to be on guard for fear that you will trigger her is not right.  That is putting too much stress on you, and you are not responsible if she acts out on the eating disorder behaviors.   I hope  you can see this.  I am glad you posted and hope you get others posting to you to give you their take on this.  I just hate to see you feeling so guilty and so responsible.  We are only responsible for ourselves.  We can not change anyone but ourselves.  We can be there to support others but ultimately we are each only responsible for ourselves.  I wish you the best and hope to see you around again.  I would like to know what you think of what I wrote.  Take care,iwanttoliveps I can tell you love your girlfriend.  But you also need to love yourself and take care of yourself and not get beat up emotionally.  Please take care of yourself.iwanttolive",hbintheam,"Wed,02/13/2019-3:23pm",Thank you for the reply and,"Thank you for the reply and the kind words.We've talked more about it over the last 2 days and had some conversations that were helpful. I'm also looking into counselors for myself, ones who focus on behavioral issues, anxiety, and relationship counseling. A major plus if they also have experience with eating disorders, but there aren't as many of those available. I sent my first e-mail out asking about a phone consultation, so making steps.Over the last few nights we talked more about the issues, and she reiterated that she doesn't want me to feel like I'm a bad partner, because she knows I'm a great one. I do so much more good than I do bad. Just the bad all comes from the same issues of me sometimes forgetting to be more thoughtful, caring, and communicative and asking her about things rather than just assuming I have the right answers all the time. I want to start counseling to work on some of these issues myself and have another outlet for me to talk about our relationship and get more perspective. But she knows I care, and she knows I'm really trying to help. But she gets frustrated because she's given me examples of what to do the next time it happens, or instructions on how I should try to handle it. I have had problems remembering exactly what to do and instead fall back onto strategies that I think are right, or what I think were something she had said in the past. I run into issues because it seems like with her ED, it can be a lot of contradictions and it's hard to know what I should be following exactly. I know ED isn't logical. She does too. She told me she often feels like she's trapped behind a wall, and she knows I'm trying to help and she knows her thinking isn't healthy or clear, but she just can't break through when she's feeling that way. She can't help by letting me know what food sounds like something she could eat when I ask. I can understand how this makes it hard for her. In order to try and keep more on top of what strategies she says would help, and to remind myself to not beat myself up emotionally and that she's the one struggling with the mental illness, I've started writing detailed notes in my phone. Little things to remind me of how she's feeling, how she would like me to help her, things I should better try not to do. So far it's helped in the immediate present and I hope it ends up being a good resource for me. I haven't told her about it though because I worry it would make her feel worse, that I would need a manual on how to deal with her when she's having issues. But at this point I just want to try and do what's right for her and get those strategies and positive thoughts of how she cares about me and knows I'm trying into my head. We had another triggered episode last night that illustrated some behaviors I think are really difficult and drive us apart more. We were talking about our upcoming engagement party and she was thinking about getting her hair blown out and having fake eyelashes done at a spa ahead of time, but she was worried about spending the money or being too extra. I talked her through options and was trying to be encouraging with my responses. When she asked at the ned of it whether I thought she should do it or not, I said ""Yeah I think you should. I want you to be comfortable at our party."" She took offense to this, and I realized what I said didn't really convey the message I wanted to send, so I tried to clarify by saying ""I mean I want you to feel beautiful and special. It's a special day and I want you to feel good."" And she got upset that I had said comfortable, meaning that she is so ugly that she would only be comfortable after having her hair and make up done professionally, or that she was so prissy she needed all this extra stuff done to feel comfortable. She said she wanted to do them because she didn't want to lose it in front of her brother while getting ready or in front of the party guests, knowing that she's been having a rough time lately with her ED and mental illness. I kept trying to tell her that she had misunderstood what I meant by saying comfortable. That I realized it was the wrong word choice, but I tried to clarify the meaning better right after by saying I wanted her to feel beautiful and special since it was a special party. But at that point, her disordered thinking had kicked in and she only heard the negative meaning she thought I had said instead of what I was actually trying to convey. Then I realized something that really effects me and frustrates me. When something like this happens and her disordered thinking kicks in, she no longer trusts me about what I had meant to say or and it feels like she doesn't believe me when I try to express how sorry I am and what I was trying to say. Then she often will say something like ""It doesn't matter. I was looking forward to the party but now it's ruined and we should cancel it. I do'nt want to do it anymore."" So then I feel more like I'm being punished because she's taking away this thing without listening to me or believing best intentions for where I'm coming from. I now know it's a common thought loop for people with ED to often think that they aren't good enough for something, and have issues with control. Those both seem to play a lot into this situation. We talked a little bit this morning about trying to remember each other having best intentions, but I still think it's a bigger conversation we need to have maybe when she's feeling a little more stable. I hear where you're coming from about it being her responsibility to manage her own reactions to triggers and how she handles them. I do think that it's something we need to have more conversations about, but I don't feel like I have space to make her feel more to blame for this. I have a problem with pushing off blame in general and not accepting it, and I know it will feel like me pushing blame onto her and me washing my hands and saying ""I can't deal with you when you're like this."" Which will hurt her a lot. I also need to be better about just thinking more about what I say before saying it. Thank you for the message about needing to love myself and taking care of myself. I need to remember that more often when we're having issues, since those always seem to blow up to being such a big thing. I think counseling will be a big help for me, and maybe it's something we need to look into together as a couple at some point but it's scary to think about doing counseling together. I always feel like that's such a slippery slope to just being the start of the end, but I know we have some fairly difficult problems we could use help working through in order to make sure we're both as happy as we can be together.",iwanttolive,"Wed,02/13/2019-9:43pm",Hi,"Hi again.  I read over your post and again, I feel that your girlfriend is being overly critical of what you say and do.  It is not fair to you.  To have you being the brunt of all her baggage.  Yes, she does have an eating disorder, but that doesn't give her the permission to make you her punching bag and that is what is sounds like from what you are saying.  Boundaries are a very important thing in relationships.  They are good, not bad. She is the one that brought up going and getting a spa treatment. You supported her.  She didn't like the way you worded it, so she got mad at you.  You shouldn't have to micromanage what you say for fear of upsetting her.  I really hope that you do get some help as this will destroy any chance of a healthy marriage. I am not married but do have relationship difficulties with my sister that I live with.  Sometimes a third party is really necessary.

53,lavender.violin,02-08-19,How can I help my girlfriend?,"Hello,
my girlfriend is suffering from bed and because of that she often feels horrible about herself to the point, where she literally isolates herself from everybody, including me. She says that she does that because she looks atrocious. I'm constantly telling her that this is bullshit and she's beautiful but it doesn't help. Once when she canceled our date evening before, I went to her house and when she finally let me in she was hiding her face from me not allowing me to look at it because she claimed her face was puffy and fat, but the thing is it wasn't, it looked just like always.
I have no idea what can I do, I feel so useless, I can't even understand her behaviour, please help me",BobJ48,"Sun,02/10/2019-10:42pm","Self-doubt, self-hate, and shame.","Hey Violin,First off, your friend is fortunate to have a friend like you.  Often when people isolate themselves, that's pretty much it for their friendships. So by keeping in touch with her, and not allowing her to completely hide from everyone, you are already helping right there. Eating disorders are pretty rough things.  Sufferers are often overcome with self-doubts and shame.  Your friend could not even show you her face, because she was filled with such hate for herself.  It's emotional symptoms like these which make EDs such terrible things.  ""I'm constantly telling her that this is bullshit and she's beautiful but it doesn't help. ""Yes, our first reaction is to try and argue or use logic with the person, but I guess you are seeing how well that works.  Not very well, unfortunately.  They honestly have these feelings and thoughts about themselves, and trying to talk them out of them…they'll just think that you really don't get it.  So you may want to try another approach.  One thing you may want to do, is try and put yourself in her shoes, and go for understanding instead ?  Which can take some practice it's true, and may not come naturally at first.   But try some things like this, maybe :""It must feel awful to doubt yourself so much.""
"" Yeah, a person can feel hateful towards themselves it's true.""
""It must feel terrible to feel like you can't even go out.""Things like that may help her feel more understood, and help get a better conversation going ?

55,JJ-letsdoit,01/21/2019,new-here-newly-married,"Hi all, I met my wife about 2 years ago and while dating she confessed to me that she has bullimia.
We are both in our mid 50s and she has ED (we call it like that) since she was about 17 years old.
She also confessed to me that she still very often binge and purge.
Of course one of the 1st things I’ve done is to, after reinsuring her that I do love her and i do want to spend the rest of my life with her, read about bullimia and educate myself a lot.
We have a long distance relationship, it’s about a 5 h away door to door and she has 3 teenage kids at home, I don’t have a kid. We got engaged and got married with her parents blessing, but many people on her side know about it because of some other issues going on.
During these last 2 years, she often distanced herself from me telling me how unperfect she is and how i desserve someone “normal” because I’m a normal guy, but we generally resolve it talking. One of the underlying issues, is that she is terrified to lose me, because of all the associated weights with her life and the ED and she often thinks that it is too much for me and that she does not desserve me. My response is always the same and it’s we will work on a better future together. Of course i studied ED recovery and read many many articles and forums and came across some studies and books.
We eventually talked about it and she agreed to work toward recovery with me trying structured eating, in parallel i looked for an ED recovery center and called some and eventually got her an appointment, few months from now. However, lately she has been under more stress and deeply feel sad about not being the best wife for me and this is something that she thinks often and often and is gaining some traction. I’m trying to help her the best i can and truly want her to recover from ED because i know that many aspects of her life will fall in place after recovery.
We both know that recovery will be slow and full of bumps and maybe relapses but we also know that this is the best possible direction. I’m afraid that she is still too afraid about a new life, because after all she is pretty comfy with ED, yet suffers a lot from it. Any advices will be like super helpful, maybe there is something i can’t see maybe someone went through a smiliar story, of course i know all stories are different but i also know from reading that there are so many aspects of ED that are carried across all with ED, after all, it is possible that common causes will generate common effects, i need to find ways for my wife to have a better life, best with me of course. Thanks all",BobJ48,"Thu,01/24/2019-8:48pm", Hello JJ.,"JJ,You wrote :""...she often distanced herself from me telling me how unperfect she is and how i deserve someone “normal” because I’m a normal guy,….One of the underlying issues, is that she is terrified to lose me, because of all the associated weights with her life and the ED and she often thinks that it is too much for me and that she does not deserve me. ""This ""unworthiness"" feeling is VERY common among people with eating disorders.  They don't deserve the care of others, for different reasons they don't deserve treatment - They can feel undeserving, and ""not good enough""  in so many ways !You are doing a good job of telling her that she is good enough for you…now her task will be to start believing that she is good enough for herself.   I often tell people that while they may have many self-doubts, it is also possible that they are a good person.  A good person with a good and kind heart. Because this is something which actually might be possible.   Even if they have a hard time believing it , it is still something which might be possible. This is something which they should think about, I believe.  We can tell them that ourselves, but they will need to reach a point where they can tell themselves that too.   Not that they will believe it right now, but just the fact that it could be possible.Also, I hope you can believe for yourself that you are doing a good job, because I do think you are.   Not that many men would take the time to do all the reading, and fewer would take the time to write on a forum like this one.   So I hope you can have faith in yourself as well.B J",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,Wthomps429,01-08-19,"Is there an acceptable level of purging, and health effects?","My fiance has had an eating disorder since she was 16. She has been on medication since she was 17 as treatment for it. She is 48 now and at a healthy weight, but still purges every week. She also works out a lot and the purging gets much worse when she doesn't. She's always connected the ED with exercise and is honest (mostly) with me when I ask her about the purging. My concern is that this amount of purging seems to be acceptable to her, but I worry about the health affects. She's frequently clearing her throat and that's usually a tell that the purging is worse. She coughs a lot, too. Is there an acceptable level of purging for someone with a long term eating disorder? Ironically, her sister is a psychologist specializing in eating disorders and doesn't seem too alarmed when I've asked her about it, except to say that she should adjust her meds, so I haven't pushed getting help. When I've suggested it to my fiance, she says she's already tried everything. Thoughts? Should I be concerned? Is there anything I can do? Thanks in advance.",Savedbygrace ,"Tue,01/08/2019-11:31pm",Unfortunately not,"Purging is very dangerous. It can lead to death. I'm sorry she has been suffering for so long. In addition to damage done to the vocal chords, purging can lead to damage to the asophegus and stomach that are irreversible. It sounds like she needs professional help. It's disturbing that her sister isn't more concerned. It is one of the most deadly mental illnesses. Since I'm not a professional, I probably don't know all the consequences of bulimia. I've struggled with it, but it would be best to also talk to a medical doctor and therapist who specialize in this area as well as NEDA staff. I hope this helps.",Wthomps429,"Thu,01/17/2019-12:07am",Thanks for the response.,"Thanks for the response.  I will talk to her sister to see if she can help.  I think she's been aware of it so long, she doesn't know what to do for her, or thinks there's nothing she can do.  I think my fiance thinks she's not doing damage because she does it right after she eats, before the acid gets too bad.  She doesn't need to use her hands or anything to initiate.  She just bends over and takes care of it.  She's so used to doing it that I don't think it seems abnormal any more.  There was a time she'd get upset about it and feel a lot of shame, but that doesn't seem to be the case now.  Though, lack of exercise was her trigger in the past, general stress seems to be an equal trigger.  I'll follow up after I talk to her sister about it.

57,trever_ray,12/18/2018,I need help with my wife who purges,"Some background:
My wife has severe anxiety and has battled with her demons since before we met.  After the birth of our second child her disease has come back in a new way.  She purges after eating but not to deal with weight.  It is her coping skill to deal with her anxiety.  I want to help her and have been doing a pretty bad job since she opened up to me.  We have had several fights that are triggered by me finding her hiding things from me.  I really need help as I am so lost and my world has been turned inside out because of all of this.  She is seeking help but I need help.  Someone please help me.",BobJ48,"Sat,12/22/2018-3:28am",Hey Trever,"Ugh, I'm sorry you guys had those fights. I'm sure that it's nothing that either of you wanted.  But yeah, EDs can be like you said -A way that people deal with anxiety.Perhaps they didn't start out that way.  In the beginning people can worry about weight gain, and purging gives them a sense of control. As time goes by, this mental association between purging and control grows stronger and can really start to etch itself into a person's brain.After a while, that's pretty much it - when the person begins to feel uncertain, and a lack of control in their lives… I guess you've seen what can happen. Those old associations with purging pop up again.  Almost like the person has no control over it. People who purge often feel shame about it, so it's probably no surprise that she's hid things from you.  People feel shame, which often feels like a lack of control - Perhaps you can see where this is going.  Things can start to snowball alright.It's good that she is seeking help, but we can feel helpless and in need of help too. Many guys get help of their own.I'm sorry your note sat here for a while, but if you see this I hope you'll keep writing.Bob J.",trever_ray,"Sun,01/13/2019-1:16am",Updating,"My wife has been seeking help and trying to get better.

Perhaps that is how she feels.  Alternatively, it's possible that she feels like she could not provide a good explanation herself.  It can be that way with EDs - People do things which even they cannot quite understand or can't make sound logical.  It's probably OK for her to keep those thing private for the time being, until she's found better resolution for them.  If she says ""You just would not understand"" I'd try to not take it too personally, even though it's hurtful to hear I know. ""Now that everything is in the open I notice more than I used to ,but she makes me feel crazy for noticing these things, and then will tell me days after that she has purged.""Yes, things can get to a point where we find ourselves picking up  on a certain vibe alright. But like you said, what can we do ?  If they actually have purged, it's usually a sign that something has caused them to feel anxious, so if you feel a need to react, it would be better to ask about that end of things,  rather than to ask about purging, you know ?  If she will allow you to ask about anything, that is. "" She has stopped trusting me and no longer comes to me for help. I feel like we are back to square one. She keeps things from me and is going from doing well to not doing well and just not telling me.""Here's one thing to keep in mind : When people start therapy, often in the beginning it can it seem like they get worse rather than getting better.  The reason for this is that now they are beginning to confront things which they may have keep swept under the rug in the past. A process which can be unsettling, and bring about  a lot of mental uncertainty.  In the past she may have known just what she thinks, but now she may not know what she thinks at all.  It may seem like she no longer trusts you, but I'd not be too sure about that.  She may be one of those people who were used to being sure about everything, but now that she's not…she keeps her distance. The general consensus is that for ourselves, our best stance is to appear calm, supportive and unflappable. As some parents once said ""Like a Redwood tree"".  The winds blow and the rains come, but we stay steady.  A stance which may involve some faking on our part it's true, but is *much* better than seeming like we're being harmed by all this, or like we are freaking out a little ourselves.

58,Michael104,01-02-19,New Member - Wife with EDs,"Happy New Year all. I have just joined this forum seeking help, tips, advice as my wife is struggling with EDs. We met nearly 8 years ago (this month). I was vacationing with friends in Costa Rica and she had been living there for 3 years (originally from the US about 30 min from where I’m from). We hit it off the night we met at a sports bar watching the NFL playoffs. We kept in touch and ultimately began a long-distance relationship before she decided to move back to the states and move in with me 8 months later.  I was thrilled, her family was thrilled and it was a really exciting time for everyone, especially the two of us.Over the 8 months of our long-distance relationship, I traveled to Costa Rica a few times and spent a week with her. Back then I wasn’t aware of her EDs. When we began living together I didn’t know right away until she was binging in front of me then told me. I was certainly surprised, but not upset with her at all and frantically began reading about eating disorders. I knew it upset her whenever the topic came up, so it was avoided like the plague. I’ve tried to support her in ways that make her feel loved and not alone. We got engaged 6 years ago and either just before or after she starting to seek help. She went to a specialist/coach for a few months and had a binder she was using. I didn’t want to upset her, so whenever she felt like sharing any details with me, I would listen. Unfortunately, we moved to another state and it was too far to continue going back to the specialist and she said there wasn’t anyone like that near where we were moving to. I took her word for it and never tried to look into it to help as I’ve always tried to be sensitive to her feelings on the matter.We have been married for over 4 years now and have been talking about starting a family, but I’m clearly concerned for her health and want to make sure she addresses her EDs. We’ve both been really busy at work (she started a new job) and is working longer hours. We have been fighting more frequently over the past couple of months and we both got things off our chest. I told her I was concerned for her well being along with the desire but fear of trying to have a baby. She told me her friend had referred her to someone for help, but was vague. As always I didn’t question it. All these years have gone by and I have allowed her to continue with her EDs “waiting” for the right time to address it when she is ready.  Christmas Day we got into a huge fight and she left my family’s place to spend the night with her parents. The next day she came home to pack up things and spent two nights at a hotel. Now she is at her friend’s apartment while she’s moving out of it this month. She’s there alone.We have barely had any contact since last week. On NYE, she texted me wishing a good night and wanted to speak New Year’s Day. I didn’t hear from her until she texted she was on her way over which I wasn’t expecting. She came home and told me how she was feeling hurt and angry over things said on Xmas day, but also how she feels alone at home if I fall asleep on the sofa. *Our bedroom is upstairs and we have two bathrooms. She goes upstairs after dinner or eating late to purge and shower before, so instead of confronting her I sleep on the sofa then will eventually wake up and go to bed.* More importantly, she told me she signed up for an online program and was going to have books sent home. I told her I was glad she was doing that and that I myself have been looking into getting help. I’ve realized that there never is a right time and now need to finally do something to learn how to better support my wife. I’m proud she is starting program, but she said she can’t be home, packed up more things and went back to her friend’s apartment. She has about 10 days left before her friend has to completely move out and I don’t want her to feel like she needs to continue to stay away from me. I want to learn how to support her the right way. I’m really just beginning this new journey, so any tips, advice, feedback, etc. would be appreciated.Thank you!
-M",BobJ48,"Fri,01/04/2019-9:29pm",Hey M.,"EDs can be secretive, and very personal as well, so it's understandable when we feel as though we don't want to intrude. Particularly if that's not been a rewarding experience for us in the past.  And yet ignoring the situation generally doesn't help things either.  So a guy can begin to feel boxed in for sure.And you are right, if she's going to feel as though she is returning because of circumstances, rather than by choice, that might turn out to be a matter of tension as well.  And you probably know by now how tension can effect things for her.One thing you might do is simply ask her how you can support her best.  Honestly, she may not have any sort of  good answer for that when you first ask her, but I think it's OK to ask her to put her mind to it, and provide you with a reasonable answer.  One the doesn't rely heavily on  the two of you just ignoring things as you did in the past.  She would probably agree that that approach didn't work out very well before.Some kind of something that actually might feel legitimately supportive to her, you know ?Granted, it would mean acknowledging the issue, but within that framework it's possible that she could come up with something that would feel OK to her, and not feel overly intrusive, or involve ramping up the tension again, even if it's something seemly small.Again, this might be something that she'll have to put her mind to, but as far as the overall pictures goes, it could be a good thing for her to try and think about.  Progress and all that, you know ?BobJ",Michael104,"Sat,01/05/2019-11:12am",Thanks,"Thanks so much for your thoughtful response and feedback, BobJ. Since my post, I have done a lot this week. I’ve chatted with someone from the NEDA who gave me several types of resources for myself and for my wife. I participated in a support group that was a video chat and I spoke with a therapist who specializes in EDs. I’m planning to meet with her for myself.I did ask my wife what can I do to help work her way back home. I told her I was committed to supporting her the proper way and that I was taking action at learning how. I also filled her in on what I was already beginning to do. This was all via text messages which I know isn’t the best way to communicate. She didn’t respond and I followed up the next day to ask her if she was available to talk this weekend. No word yet.",BobJ48,"Sat,01/05/2019-2:37pm",Michael,"It sounds like you really have taken some responsible steps for yourself.  Not too many fellows would do that, and as far as setting things aside, as you did for some years, it really does sound like you are done with that approach, and are ready to confront things head on.Which may be what she is afraid of, and why you have not heard from her yet.None the less, if she really is doing this online program thing, she probably knows that just taking half-measures isn't going to work, and that like yourself, if she's serious about getting better, she's going to have to go all-in.   But yes, for the moment she may feel intimidated by what she assumes will be your expectations.   Like she's got the recovery thing to deal with, and then she's got you.So yeah, it probably would be good if she could sit down and think about how being around you could be a positive, rather than just one more pressure to deal with.  If you meet with this ED person, maybe she could give you some suggestions too ?The fact that you are going to such lengths to understand things will be a good thing too I think.  People with EDs often  believe that no outsiders can ever really ""get it' about what they are going though, but personally I don't think that's the case.  Granted, our readings don't always go into that part, but if you keep poking around you may find things that help you have a better idea about the sorts of things that she's up against, inside that head of hers.  That sort of knowledge can help you craft your responses to her, in ways that may feel understanding to her.   In ways that may help put her a bit more at ease.In any case, I hope you can make the moving-back-in thing work for you both.

59,mbohnenk,01-07-19,Help Me understand,"I have read many of people who are dealing with the same issues with their spouses that I am.  I feel your pain and frustration.
I am my own worst enemy when it comes to supporting my wife.  We have been married since 2003 and she has been dealing with this since she was a teenager. We have fights over this on a regular bassis and each time its a little different.  She always says I don't talk to her.  I can see that.  Let me say I am not the best support person when it comes to this.  I know I am not.  When it is anything else I'm there but struggle with the eating in supporting her.  She has done more research on this than I care to imagine and I am playing catchup.   I miss all the signs and feel so stupid after the face but by then its to late and the walls and fighting begin.
Today started out with argument and me not being there for her or talking to her.  Issues have been boiling for a while now.  We talk about everything else during the day while were at wok and things are icey but ok.   I bring it up t talk and I don't have to confidence to talk to her because I am trying to fix the issue or she doesn't want to open herself up to what she is carrying around that I wont respond or know how to respond to be beneficial to her so we argue a little bit and then we stop.  I was doing some research and not finding anything to help and she goes to bed mad because I ignored her the whole night. But we can't talk because I dont have the right tools.  I see her point a little but struggle to do the right thing.   Just want her to feel loved but she just feels alone.  She is now in bed crying telling me to leave her alone.  I see divorce coming because neither one of us are happy.

She does seem to mention the ""lack of communication"" thing though, and it sounds like you know that that's something that you guys need to work on.One think to keep in mind is that men tend to want to think in terms of ""things getting fixed"", while often all the other person wants is to be understood.  So keep those two things in mind if you can.Here's an example of something you might say, the next time she talks about how you don't talk to her, you could say ""It must be frustrating to feel like I don't understand any of this.""   That's the kind of statement which will encourage her to talk, as well as showing her that you actually are hoping to understand her. This may seem like an obvious suggestion, but you might want to think about couples counseling.  Sure it costs money, but the few times I've been involved in things like that, it's been pretty great.   Having a third party help with the communication can be a real eye-opener I found, and can help people get feelings out which they may have had a hard time expressing before.  So you might want to give some thought to that.Again, keep in mind that people want to be known, and want to be heard.  If you can come at the situation from that angle, rather than worrying about fixing the situation, then you might see things start to shift a little.Keep writing ?Bob J",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,bagnja1,12/27/2018,Helpless,"Hello,I hope everyone is doing well.I have read through a few posts, and I am sorry for being repetitive by asking probably the same questions as someone else, but it always feels better when you get a response to your own issues. Especially since everyone has a different story.My wife has struggled with her image since she was a toddler. She told me that even as a kid she didn't like the way she looked. Along with that she has suffered with extreme social anxiety since birth. She does not function well in public and when at work she has to fake being who she is to succeed. When she was 13, she started purging and limiting food intake. We started dating at 18 and she told me about the eating disorder around 19. We are now both 32 years old.Over the years I have done more and more research, and found that as she gets older her body is going to more than likely fail. This worries me because she is my soul mate. Divorce to me is not an option, because I love her so much. This one issue is pretty much all we ever fight about.As far as what I have done to try to help. I probably haven't been the best support, to be honest. I started off by chastising and fussing at her once I found out. This is due to my own moral compass issues where I get probably a little too angry when people lie to me. So, when she lied to me about it or she actually purged I would raise my voice and just make her feel bad. At the time I felt she was being selfish and she didn't care. On top of that she has promised to go to therapy for years but has never gone. She states that she gets major anxiety having to find a doctor to go to, and doesn't like being rejected. She said that she has reached out but the doctor either wasn't a good fit or they were full.Now I know the way I acted above is not good. It's wrong. I did wrong. Recently, she has been opening up to me about her disorder. She has had no traumatic event. She says that she is the way she is and she has grown accustom to it. She wants me to talk with her about it, but I don't know how to help her. I do not know what to say. My question: What should I say to help her through dark times? I can definitely tell that she is in a phase of binging and purging. I caught her and it opened the flood gates and this is what triggered me to really change tactics. She keeps putting off a therapist; so i need help with how to get her to go.Please help,JB",BobJ48,"Fri,12/28/2018-4:03pm",JB,"The one thing that stands out to me in your note is the fact that for some reason she wants to discuss her situation with you.

61,Biolley,11/22/2018,How to start helping my partner,"Hi friends! Thank you in advanced for your valued help! I'm starting a relatioship with my partner, she has Bulimia Nervous from almost 18 years ago, she just told me about it today, but I know her since 15 years ago, when we had a previous relationship, so after 15 years we started a new relationship again, and she is still struggling with bulimia. The past week I started to talk and meet with her so we started to talk about a weight reduction plan and diet and so on, but I was not aware that she was being affected for bulimia yet, so I told her about a plan that I'm doing with the one I lost more than X pounds in a year with little to no changes in my life so she was amazed with it, and today she told me that she was trying to lose weight due to my advice (I did not adviced her, just told her my story) so she started a diet plan and it sent her directly to relapse with Bulimia, to the point that last night she started to vomited blood, and she had started to eat as a crazy (binge) and purge X times a day... To make it worse she works as waitress in a Marriot restaurant so there she can eat as much as she wants to, so she can't stop and is beggining to have problems with their job due to that she is going a lot to the bathroom so her boss is starting to think that she is avoiding her job and she does not wants to tell them about his disease for fear to be fired off. So my question is, how can I start to help her? We have not money right now to pay for professional help, but I can't wait a second to start helping her, so please help me to know where to start, what exercises can she start doing at least to start recovery (don't purge herself). I know a lot about addictions, I'm coach and activist for pornography and sex addiction, so I know a lot about behavioral and substance addictions, but Bulimia is something new for me, so please guide me to help her. Where does Bulimia starts in life? For chilhood neglected, traumas, social anxiety? Some Kindle or ebooks that could be helpful to read? In the meanwhile I would read as much as I can this website, and forum, also I will suggest her some exercises we do with sex addictions to set up boundaries and start loving oneself. Your help would be fully appreciated, thank you so much!",BobJ48,"Sat,11/24/2018-2:20pm",Biolley,"First off, welcome to the forum.  Bulimia can be a mysterious thing, so it's good that you are looking for answers.There are many aspects to bulimia, but you are right about the addiction part. If she has been struggling with this for 18 years, all of the issues regarding addition apply.Also it is important to understand that eating disorders are about personal control.  Or at least the were when she first began doing it.  People need to eat, but they also want to lose weight.  And purging can seem like a way to gain control over their situation.  As time passes, the connection between purging and being in control establishes a mental association in her brain that becomes extremely difficult to change or get rid of.  Even when they realize that their behaviors are OUT of control, the association between purging and control still remains. As a result, when situations arise in their life where they feel insecure, or not in control of things, bulimia can often get worse.Eating can have it's mental associations too.  If a person eats, that can symbolize being out of control, even if the logical part of their brain knows that it isn't. What I mean is, keep the control issue in mind, when you see her struggling with things.  It may not even be a conscious thing for her (because now there is also the addiction part going on) anymore, but dealing with it will play a big role in any attempts to recover that she makes.One other thing to keep in mind - The idea of taking risks.  Any change from her normal patterns will feel upsetting and filled with uncertainty.  Which can set off concerns about control, which leads to….well, you probably have seen what it leads to.  So she's going to have to be willing to take some risks for herself, and be willing to step into some areas where things are indeed uncertain and unpredictable. So yes, taking risks, and dealing with uncertainties - These are things that she will have to be willing to face, and try and tolerate as best as she can.Also, slip-ups are certain to happen.  After all these years they are almost inevitable.  She needs to understand beforehand that this is the case. These will always feel like losses of control, and now that you understand bulimia's association control, you probably know what that means.  Given that the person is sure to slip up along the way, fighting against relapse, and understanding that one slip up does not have to signify total failure, will be a big part of recovery too.In any case, these are a few of the things that it will be important to understand, along with the reading you're doing.   Bulimia can be extremely difficult to get rid of, because of the sorts of associations that seem to actually hard-wire themselves into the person's brain, so I do hope that you'll keep writing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,mountainsmts,11-11-18,I don't know what's right and what's wrong,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 7 months. We're both 17, and she has an eating disorder. She told me about it around the end of the summer, and its been difficult for us to deal with. More so for me to deal with I guess. She's not underweight, but she expresses a desire to be underweight. She feels she can't get help until she gets to that point. It scares me so much. Even the fact that she has it at all now scares me. The threat of losing her brings me so much anxiety. As a result I feel constantly obligated to worry about her and feel as though the disorder will take her away from me. She has told me repeatedly that she does not want help yet. She mostly just doesnt want help because she doesnt want her parents to know and mess everything up more, and i do agree with that but im still greatly concerned about her. I have allowed my self to kind of step back and realize that I dont need to be responsible for her, and that i don't need to worry about her constantly, but I just dont know when is appropriate to express concern. I want to encourage her to eat more, while at the same time letting her be responsible for this, but I dont know how to balance the two. It feels like i either need to not care at all and never check up on her, or be constantly worried and push her to make the decision to eat. Sometimes I ask if she's had anything to eat for the day, or ask if she's had breakfast, and sometimes she says no, and I just don't know what to do after that. What immediately comes to my head is to express that I wish she would have eaten something, but that seems as though it would only hurt her. I dont know exactly what I expect to gain out of posting this, but i guess I'm just looking for some more guidance. Ive read different guides on helping a partner with an eating disorder, but none of them answer all of my questions. Theres just so much im unsure about.",BobJ48,"Wed,11/14/2018-2:38am",What to do….,"Mountains,Yes, figuring out a helpful approach…I guess I don't have to tell you how confusing that can be. When there seem to be so many factors to try and balance out.And just to say, the seemingly contrary concerns and attitudes she expresses are not uncommon at all.  On the one hand, she doesn't want to burden or be a bother to anyone, but on the other hand, the only way she feels she'll be worthy of getting the help that it seems she understands she will need, is if she gets even more deeply into her ED than she is now, and really gets sick.  Which of course will really alarm  her parents, and with good reason. The other danger in this help-getting strategy is that the longer she lets this stuff etch itself into her brain, the harder and harder it will be for her to get quit of it, once she does decide its' time to get help.  So yeah, the whole "" I don't deserve help until I've made myself a whole lot sicker"" (which is a *very* common belief among people with EDs) is not a good approach to this at all.  And you are right : How are we supposed to express our concern in any sort of way that will seem helpful to them ?  ""Gosh, I wish you would eat""…you've probably figured out how helpful comments like that are likely to be. Stuff like that just makes them feel guilty or ashamed.  Which is not the greatest motivator.My approach is to try and be understanding, and see if I can put myself in their shoes.  Because people with EDs can feel really alone with the thoughts they are having.  "" I know it must be difficult to think that you aren't worthy of help.""   ""I know that people can feel like they are losing control they allow themselves to eat.""  ""I can understand where you don't want to bother your parents with this.""None of that is going to help them to eat of course, but there is value in believing that someone else understands some of the thoughts they are trying to deal with.  And might help her express and confront some of her fears and feelings.Rather than ""fixing"", it's more of a support thing, you know ?Anyhow, just some suggestions.  If you have more questions, or it seems to help just to vent, I do hope that you will keep writing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,likethebird,11-10-18,am I doing this right?,"My girlfriend and I are both women and 21. We have been dating for two years, and she has been open with me about her disorder for as long as I've known her. I have been pushing her for recovery this whole time and I think now it's finally a possibility. However, I have watched her attempt recovery before and fail because of lack of support. We have no family that we're on speaking terms with, few friends, and we live paycheck to paycheck with no insurance and no wiggle room for therapy. It's just her and me.She is completely controlled by the disorder at this point and simply is not able to change her thoughts, behaviors and habits on her own even though she wants to. She is (understandably) terrified of recovery but trying her best. She needs help, but there just isn't any besides me I am her only support and am finding myself playing her therapist and nutritionist as well as lover and best friend. I know you're not supposed to do that but there isn't any advice for when other options aren't available. I'm overwhelmed and scared of what will happen to her and to me if I fail.I've promised her I won't leave her because of this and I intend to keep that promise. We are currently working together to find self-worth and confidence for both of us, and I have her writing down disordered thoughts so that she can learn to tell the difference between disordered thoughts and healthy ones. I don't know if either of these things are the right thing to do, but I also don't know what else to try.",BobJ48,"Sun,11/11/2018-12:54pm",Like the bird,"Hey Bird,Yeah, it's not like everyone has access to professional help, and to be honest, professionals can only do so much.  Plus the quality of connection can make a real difference in situations like these.  As you said, trying to play all those different roles at once is probably not ideal, but the caring part can still make a difference I think.Although as you may have seen, the ""Love is all you need"" cure doesn't always work either.  There really is only so much we can do from our side of things, so keeping that part in mind can help us with the sorts of reactions we inevitably find ourselves having too.Having said all that, it really does seem like you are taking a sound approach with your efforts.  Gaining a better perspective can help I think, so the part about writing out her thoughts…that really does seem like it could help with that part.  Because as I'm sure you have seen, a lot of those inner thoughts and self-judgments can seem pretty over the top, once viewed objectively in the clear light of day.  This is not to say that people should not be effected by these sorts of thoughts, because simply as human beings we're often effected by unreasonable thoughts, but even so, I think trying to give such thoughts a dispassionate examination can be a helpful thing.   Plus just getting them out there, rather than keeping them bottled up helps too I think.Working on the idea of personal worthiness, and the whole ""good enough"" concept is important too. Do we deserve a worthy place in the world, as the person we already are, or are we stuck with constantly striving for some kind of elusive perfectionism that simply saps our energy in it's pursuit ?   It's true that it's worth striving to be a better person, but it's not some set of numbers on a scale that's really going to  provide us with the sorts of inner judgments we're looking for.  Being able to enjoy normal life is important too.  People can shut themselves away if they don't watch out, so ""getting out"" and staying engaged in the outside world can be a mindful thing that you'll want to try too. Anyhow, this was kind of a rambling response I know, so if it helps, I hope you'll keep writing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,dangerousBlues,11-07-18,Partner refuses to get help and I'm scared for her life,"I'm having a hard time writing this because it's upsetting me to even talk about it anymore but at the same time I feel like screaming. I (19, f) met my girlfriend (19,f) a little under a year ago in a class we shared at our community college. We've been together since then, and I've always known about her eating disorder-it was never a revelation or her confessing to me. From the beginning, I knew that certain places were to be avoided when we went out to eat, etc, and that she had meticulous behaviors that revolved around food and eating. Obviously, as we've been together, I've learned more about her disorder. She has been suffering from disordered thoughts surrounding food and body dysmorphia since she was 11 or 12, she started restricting a few years after that and when she was 17 she began restricting heavily. On the daily, she generally refuses to eat a low number of calories a day, and sometimes she will fast. When I met her, she told me she was attempting some form of recovery-she had had a ""wake up call"" in the form of a doctor's visit after she didn't get her period for over 6 months. They tried to take blood but she hadn't eaten anything for days before the appointment, and as a result she passed out, seized, and then vomited and they weren't able to do labs. This was about a year ago, and it made her want to get better for a while, or at least try to. When I met her, I think she was already on the downward slope, and she says its worse now than it has ever been. She has heart palpitations, sharp pains in her chest and ribs, sharp pains in her limbs, she gets dizzy and nauseous, she can't walk up stairs without nearly passing out, and most recently after fasting, she woke up one morning and had a serious bout of vomiting. She is an adult, and refuses treatment adamantly. Her mother and I took her to Urgent Care 2 weeks ago at about 1 am, because of the heart things that were going on. The doctor barely looked at her, said ""well you look fine, you look hydrated"" and left for 30 minutes. He didn't come back, so we just left. The doctor's reaction made her feel like she isn't ""sick enough,"" even though she is VISIBLY underweight. Last week we took her back to the same doctor she first went to about her period last year, and after doing some tests they determined that she is, in fact, underweight (they didn't tell us or her her weight, and didn't write it down which she appreciated) and her heart is slowing down. The doctor then told her to come back in a week (which fell today) and gave her an assessment packet from the local eating disorder clinic. Since then, the two of us have had numerous arguments about this. Our only disagreements or fights to date have been about her eating disorder, and her refusal to get help. She feels like her mom and I are forcing her into treatment, into doctor's tests and the like. I KNOW that you can't force someone to recover, but the doctor told us all that right now it's critical. She's doing serious and permanent damage to her body and she knows this but can't bring herself to seek help. She feels she's not sick enough, and refuses to seek help until she reaches her ""goal weight."" she reached her original GW months ago, and moves it down each time. The doctor flat out told her she will die before she reaches this one. I know she's mad at her mother and I, and I know she feels weird about the openness with which her family is finally talking about this. Yesterday night, Her mom, mom's boyfriend, brother and I went to a ""family night"" at the clinic to learn how to better support her. It was geared mostly at people who had a loved one in recovery, or at least starting to recover. My girlfriend isn't close. She feels as if she can't, and I have seen how much she suffers. She has panic attacks every time she eats, she feels the need to purge constantly (although she hasn't done that in about a year,) she exercises obsessively and it's frankly terrifying how thin she's getting. The worst thing is she can't see that, no matter how obsessively she performs body checks, her brain makes her see herself entirely differently. This is long, and there's so much more, and it's breaking my heart how much this is hurting her because I truly do intend to spend the rest of my life with her. I can't express how scary this is to me and how upsetting it is without causing her to feel guilt, which is not my intention at all. She feels she is being forced, or guilted, or unwillingly put into recovery before she is ready but if she doesn't seek help soon she could die. I'm terrified. I want to support her, I am there for her as much as I possibly can be, but I work and am in school (she is taking time off school,) so that's a lot of time she feels isolated and alone. During this time, she watches toxic movies that she KNOWS will trigger her (to the bone, similar movies) she scrolls through ""thinspo,"" she does anything she can to purposely trigger herself. Her brain twists everything I say or do to mean that I don't like her, or want to be with her. No matter how many times I repeat it, if I do something like fall asleep when we are watching a movie when I get off work, or even when I don't think I HAVE done anything, she gets so so upset. Of course I would never blame her for this, I know it's not HER. but at the same time, It's so hurtful. I feel absolutely helpless, I feel like I am standing around watching her kill herself, and when I do anything else she feels like she can't trust me anymore. I'm scared to lose her and I don't know what to do. I just want to beg someone to help, anyone, I'm not even religious but I've prayed for it. I'm desperate. I don't know what to do. I would do anything for this girl, I just have no idea what she needs.",BobJ48,"Thu,11/08/2018-1:51pm",Blues,"Dear DB,You wrote :"" She feels she's not sick enough, and refuses to seek help until she reaches her ""goal weight."" she reached her original GW months ago, and moves it down each time. ""This certainly is how it goes with people who have EDs.  And what it points out is that folks are not so much addicted to BEING thin, as they are to the PROCESS of getting thin.  All the obsessive self-discipline and self-denial, and the rigid control they exert over their lives and their urges - These are the things which help them feel safe in the world.  Giving these things up is unthinkable, because….well…they might get…fat ?   ""Fat"" being an emotional stand-in for the idea of their lives being totally out of control.   And really, who among us could live with ourselves, or feel any sense of personal security if our lives were out of control ?So once goal-weight is reached, you can pretty much understand why it needs to be lowered again, if the process of keeping emotionally safe is to continue. Or so ""ED Logic"" goes.  And really, there is a form of logic to it. But one that pretty much has to ignore all of the horrible physical, psychological and relational problems that come with it. It's also as you have said - Who can force them to look at things differently ?  Will a packet from the local eating disorders clinic really have any effect ? Whatever happens, for real change to begin, she's going to have to be willing to take some big emotional risks.  And when the only thing that helps you feel existentially safe are your ED behaviors, that really is asking a lot of someone.  ""Dare to be Imperfect""  you know ?But that is what's going to need to happen.  She is going to need to take some pretty big emotional risks for herself. I think you are seeing just how hard that's going to be for her. None the less, there's probably still a part of herself that understands that the situation is not good.  ""Everyone is trying to control me"" may be what seems to be the worst thing to her now.   But at some point she's likely to come to the conclusion that her ED is playing some role in why things aren't going so well.     Being able to label her ED as ""a problem"" will be a big step for her, but it sounds like that's what's going to need to happen next, before any true progress can be made.Anyhow, I'm rambling.

Also, the doctor's comment who was working in the emergency department that night, is really frustrating and makes me angry just reading it. Those who suffer from eating disorders may appear healthy or might ""look fine"" (which sounds by what you are telling us, she is severely underweight), but might be extremely ill underneath it all. Coming from my own personal experience with an eating disorder (which my symptoms were at their worse right around the same age you and your girlfriend are), I also did not want help from anyone. The want to change has to come from her and it sounds like her eating disorder is in full control of everything in her life right now. If there is anything we can do to help, let us know and continue writing if it helps. I know eating disorders most definitely take a toll not only on the sufferer, but also on the people around them.

65,Helpforafriend,10/16/2018,Sorry to have to ask this...,"I don't mean to be at all insensitive, so please don't take this as such. I have a friend who has been suffering from anorexia for many years. She has two small children. I know this is nor unique, unfortunately, but she denies the existence of a problem and refuses help. Her husband is in denial, constantly making excuses that she has been feeding him for years, excuses such as ""She has had two kids, so her doctor's would have said if she was really in danger,"" to"" people are just jealous of her,"" to""well she survived this long so she will be fine.""I, as well as many others in our community, fear that her death with me sooner than later, so here is my ask; I am looking for a widower who has lost his wife who has young  children. We feel that the only way to get her husband to wake up is to find someone who has gone to the end of the line and is in a similar life position. We fear that if we find someone who has lost a teenager, or a spouse who doesn't have kids, that her husband will justify the lack of reality based on the difference in life styles. We feel that he needs to reach her because she is too far gone to get help. Her husband needs to be the wake up call, and she is the dominant force in the relationship, so he, essentially, needs to be scared straight in order to help.

My sincere apology.,BobJ48,"Thu,10/18/2018-12:54pm",Seeing the light,"Dear Help For,Boy, situations like this are alarming alright, but with the rules about sharing private information here, I think the moderators would likely edit out any sort of contact information that you might try and provide, if someone were to show up, and if they were to be interested in revisiting that painful place in their own life again. It is strange though, when folks seem to be in denial like this. It seems to be human nature that no one ever wants there to be ""a problem"" , so they just pretend that there isn't one.In this situation, my guess is that while the husband may think there's not an issue, I'll bet his wife knows that there is. Folks don't stay thin like that without a lot of pain and constant amounts of effort and discipline.  They know that their stamina is not always there, and that they aren't always able to stay on top of things mentally or emotionally in the ways that they might like to be.But yes, getting to the place where they are able to admit that there *is* a problem is a huge part of getting better, and I'm never sure that others can bring someone to a place like that if they simply don't want to be brought there.

66,FCRH2020,09/26/2018,Trying to Maintain Patience,"My partner has struggled with an eating disorder for virtually her entire life. Up until now, she had not made much progress toward getting healthy. A few months ago, though, she found a good therapist, a nutritionist, and a primary care physician, all of whom she sees weekly (we are lucky and grateful for these resources). Despite this ""army"" of professionals, she has continued to lose weight. She now knows exactly how much she needs to be eating, what kind of calories she needs to introduce to her diet, etc., but she simply can't bring herself to follow the guidance of these various doctors. I know the mental and emotional stress that eating causes her. I know this is so far from easy for her. I know it isn't as simple as knowing what to eat, then eating. But even with all this in mind, I find myself becoming so intensely frustrated with my partner. She is such a smart, driven, determined individual, and it is wildly frustrating to watch her consider the advice of these professionals, then ignore it. I know I shouldn't think about it like this—ED's are so psychologically complex, and it's not that she is *choosing* to ignore professional advice but that she is psychologically and mentally *unable* to follow the advice. But this understanding has not helped alleviate my frustration. Each time I find myself feeling that frustration, it is immediately followed by shame and guilt. How is it fair for me to feel frustrated when SHE is the one who is suffering? How can I allow my patience to waiver when SHE is the one who must endure all of this? I studied psychology in college, and I am in training to be a medical doctor. My knowledge base for ED's is broad, and I have done all I can to understand them conceptually. And yet, here I am, frustrated beyond belief because my partner can't bring herself to eat that sandwich. This is my first time trying an online community, so I don't know what exactly I'm looking for. I would appreciate any support / advice.",iwanttolive,"Wed,09/26/2018-8:03pm",FCRH2020,"Hello and welcome to the forum.  I am glad you posted and are seeking support.  You are right in saying eating disorders are psychologically based and it isn't as easy as ""just eating"".  But watching a loved one suffer affects let's say you.  You are deeply affected because you love her and can't do a thing to ""make"" her better.  It is scary.   I don't care how much you know about eating disorders.  Going through it and living with it is at times unbearable.  I know.  I am now in recovery after thirty plus years of suffering.  What I put my parent's through.  My Mom cried herself to sleep at night.  My sister with whom I live, we were meeting with my Dad, usually my Mom joins us and we have been trying to learn to live together in harmony and peace and are watching a video series on this topic.  Well, it didn't go well.  Ended disastrously.  My sister is very ill and spends 98% of her time in her room with the door closed and in bed.  She was saying she knows me and that I am black and white in my thinking and react to everyone and am cruel to her.  I told her you don't know me.  She said she grew up with me.  She didn't know that in the forth grade I wanted to kill myself.  That I spent thirty  years being very ill.  Living in hospitals and day programs.  Twenty seven hospitals ranging from one year to two weeks.  I am now recovered.  I said you don't know me.  You left the house when you were 17.  My illness affected every member of my family.  My younger sister watched me almost die in front of her eyes. She has never gotten over this.  This was thirty years ago.  She still doesn't want to connect with me on any level.  The eating disorder took so much from me and ruined my relationships with my four sisters.  It still is affecting the way my sister that I live with sees me today based on what she knew of me from before.  It is so sad.As for you, I said all of this to tie into your pain and fear and worry and no you are not directly affected by the eating disorder, the mental torment, the obsessing, the fear of gaining even an ounce.  But you are greatly affected by it.  It is okay to admit that.  It is okay for you to seek help for yourself to learn how to cope with her illness and how it affects you.  It IS frustrating.  It DOESN'T make sense.  Logically.  But we aren't dealing with logic here.  Your partner may need hospitalization.  Has she ever been hospitalized before?  Would she do it?  Sometimes the eating disorder is so severe, the sufferer like you said is unable to change.  But please don't give up on her and on Hope.  You are there for her and are supporting her.  That is really great.  But you also need to take care of yourself.  Know your limits.  Take a break if necessary.  Just know that you are not alone on this forum.  There are others who understand, and others like me who have recovered and realize how much pain I caused my family.  How I put my life on hold for thirty plus years.  That my actions hurt others.   Not on purpose.  Breaks my heart.  My heart is broken over how sick my sister is and how she still sees me.  I am not the same person I was.  She only remembers the sick me and is so sick herself now, that she is unable to see the changes in me.  I am sorry for your pain.  I am glad you are reaching out.

The woman who's the head of her class, the individual who's able to bring determination and sticktoitaivness to an issue, a drive for perfection and attention to detail,  all too often it's qualities like these, that are celebrated by our society, which also seem to make certain folks vulnerable to EDs.

And yet, here I am, frustrated beyond belief because my partner can't bring herself to eat that sandwich. ""Keep in mind what's quickly becoming an old saying in neurobiology : ""Neurons that fire together wire together.""  Then take a look at some of the posts that you can see on the large peer-to-peer ED websites, where people are in the initial acute phases of their EDs.  What you'll see the more self-aware participants complaining about is how things have reached a point in their lives where thoughts about restricting have taken up every minute of their day-to-day thinking.   Among the less self-aware you'll see obsessed chilling posts that illustrate that very same thing ; Long posts where every single sentence contains one sort of number or another.  When a person's brain is still in it's formative years, and those sorts of intense thoughts are filling their minds 24/7, it's easy to see how literally hard-wired a person's  brain can become, and as a result, understand why such mental associations can become intractable, and so terrifically difficult to overcome.In short, it's not an attitude issue, but a physical matter of neurological organization. Which as you are seeing, is really hard to overcome, even when the sufferer understands their situation intellectually, and wishes with all their heart to overcome it. ""Tribal wisdom"" also agrees that the issue of control is a big one as well - Restriction = control.  And as most of us know, being out of control can be frightening   So there's a fear element that's related to control that's at work as well. So yeah, how can people overcome this ?  Dare to be imperfect ?  Dare to be out of control ?  When one is fighting their own brain wiring, sometimes I wonder if a willingness to take risks such as these are part of the answer.

Sure she's the one who is suffering, and we need to respect that, but as a caring person, I believe that you'd be in denial if you claimed that you were not suffering too. To be honest, you'd have more reason to feel guilt and shame if you didn't care, and if you weren't having an emotional reaction.  So try not to get too down on yourself if you are having some reactions of your own.  It's human nature, you know ? In any case, I'm starting to ramble.

67,Robmacall,08/19/2018,heart broken and feel so guilty,"Hello there,Recently because of unstable mood lately I have been lurking on this website looking for answers to complex questions of my relationship. We broke up months ago but the romance that we shared still haunts me. No matter how much I try to forget, those thoughts I have of us still visits me. This may in fact be a very long post, so brace yourselves.So I met this girl whilst I was out with the boys. You know how it is. Sometimes you hang out with friends, dancing, drinking then all of the sudden your eyes meet another girls eyes and that feeling hits you in the tummy. Men know all too well that feeling of the butterfly within his stomach. So we dance a bit and exchange numbers. Who would think that you can meet the someone that would have such an impact on your life, in a bar? of all places. If someone had prophesied this to me I would have told them their were liars.Anyway we began texting and calling each other and our romance began to grow. As someone who has had a nightmare with a previous relationship before, i thought to myself this was just Karma giving me the relationship I deserved. She was perfect. Everything I could ask for in a lover and we weren’t even intimate yet. There was no words to express how intelligent she was, how caring, how loving. I should have known because it was too good to be true. I have initial worries about our age different because I am nearly a decade older, but things seemed very good.So after a while I had to travel for a month to another country on a business trip and I tell her that when I come back I would love to continue this relationship. So I travel many miles away to a foreign land on business. We chat the whole time messaging each other. I think we must have texted almost everyday. Well the business trip lasted a whole month with me becoming more and more anxious to meet my lady. When you have these feelings days feel like months. Finally the business trip is over and I can get back to my lady. Spent another many hours on the plane I can't wait to be home.The next day I call her to arrange a meeting. I bought her a present and can't wait to give it to her. I am waiting nervously at this cafe to see her. About 10 mins later she arrives at the venue, however something is wrong. She has lost some much weight. I mean so bad I can see her body changes right away. It is funny how you can often overlook certain traits when you have feelings for someone. Obvious signals of problems can seem like no big deal. We hug and kiss, talk a bunch about what happened since I was away etc. After catching up we part ways but keep contact on the phone. I do mention to her that I am concerned about her physical state and that I think she should try and stop the weight loss. Also I politely as her to stop seeing the crazy dietitian because there is nothing else to lose.. I mean I was only gone a month, how can you drop weight that quickly? (Looking back I should have not said this)So we continue the relationship and things just seem like a dream. It was like Vanilla Skies and we were very close. I felt like I won the lottery. We were both happy nothing was wrong. I become Mr Romance, sending flowers and candy. I even began to walk differently. More confident because I had the girl of my dreams. One time she came over to mine and we went out and had an excellent time. However after the lovely date she starts behaving in a very strange way. She keeps going to the bathroom. Constantly. (I should have clocked on to this also because I consider myself a fairly astute guy but I had rosy colored glasses on)It all began to fall apart about a few months later. She writes me how happy she is that things are going well and that she tells me one her dark secrets from her past. How she once indulged in a form of self bodily harm through a form of cutting. She claims at the time she was a teenager and that it was only once (again another red flag that my rosy colored glasses should have picked up). As usual I tell her that it was in the past and this is today. We are together and we can both fix anything.After about a week or so later she tells me that she wants to come over. So I meet her at my place, and everything is still cool, that was until we had to go to sleep. I try to touch her and she freaks out. I calm her down and ask her what is wrong. She tells me she has been seeing a psychologist about some issues she was having. I manage to calm her down and put her to sleep. The next morning I make us breakfast but she seems out of sort and wanted to go home quickly. I get drive her home and assure her that nothing about this changes how i feel about her.The next day I call her and reassure her that I am there for her and whatever problems she is facing is not impossible and that we can over them together. I offer to take time off work and go with her to her counseling sessions and whatever she needs I will support her. So we both agree to go together to and she offers to go with me on a certain date. So that date comes and I leave the office early because I am planning to go with her. I call her phone she doesn’t answer. Then I send a message to which she replies that she was in the shower and just came out. She tells me that she will be on her way to the therapist. So I ask her where to go so i can meet her. She behaves as if I have no idea what I am talking about and that she prefer to go alone. So I happily oblige. Things begin to go from bad to worse from this point. Petty arguments become bigger and bigger and the girl that I saw, so many ago, is hardly recognizable both in physical and mental form. We can't do anything because she hates the idea and feels anxiety about the whole thing. Things get so bad that I consider leaving the relationship all together but I think to myself things will get better. Except there is that part of my brain saying you can get leave this relationship before it goes south. Except you are going to be the jerk that leaves a girl when she is in critical condition and needs your help. So I decide to stay and try and work things out. But the arguments get worse to the point that I am beginning to not recognize myself. Her mood changes from hot to cold. She is always too busy to meet. I am constantly apologizing for things I didn’t do wrong just so that I can stay with her. I just can't get anything right. I feel like I am walking on a string and my relationship is on the edge of a pin. One slight move the wrong way and it is all over.Well the final nail in the coffin came mid December just before Christmas. My then GF collapses and has to go to the hospital. I get the message from her and rush down stairs like a bat out of hell. The office staff must have thought I lost my mind. Just before I start the ignition i get a call from her saying she is ok and that the doctors have diagnosed her with anorexia. I feel horrible and offer to come see her after work but she declines and tells me she will call me at night. When I get home I call one of her relatives and seek advice on how I can help her because I am really worried. The relative informs me of some shocking news. Not only is one of her parents in hospital over a serious illness but she herself has issues and that there is little I can do except support her anyway that I can. Her problems stem from things that happened in her teen years and that they thought I should break up with her and try and remain friends instead. How absurd and idea, I thought to myself. You want me to break her heart? No way, I thought to myself we will fight this thing. The next day I call to see how she is and she tells me she is with one of her relatives in the hospital. I tell her I know about everything and that I am staying to fight beside her in regards to her issue and that I was aware of the illness of one of her parents because I spoke to one of her relatives the day before. Nothing was going to tear me away. This was the final nail in the coffin and if I had known it was going to end this way, I would have kept my mouth shut. She literally flips out. I mean she goes crazy. I am sure at this point had I been in from of her she would have hit me. It get so bad she hangs up. In 10 mins I receive a message informing me that our relationship is over. I call back trying to patch things up but she is not accepting any kind of apology. I may as well go and jump off a bridge, for all she cares. I think let me give her space and call her later. So I call her later after everything has calmed down and try to plead with her not to act rash and that I had her best interest at heart. She tells me she is still mad and that the best I can hope for is friendship right now and that she can’t be in a relationship right now. Devastated doesn’t even begin to cover how i feel. I felt like the world around me was crashing around me.I decide to give her some space and didn’t contact her for a while until new years eve where I sent her and her relatives a new years message. I received replies from all of them even her. And she asked if we can remain friends to which I wrote a lengthy email explaining why I can’t be her friend because of the feeling. So we don’t speak for a few months and at this point I got very good at staring at walls for hours on end. I don’t hear anything until a 2 months later where she contacts a relative of mine and she impresses upon them that therapy was great and that she still wants a friendship with me. I was going to call and accept the offer with the hopes that I can resurrect our relationship, but on the advice of a certain friend of mine she tells the fact that she is doing this is very suspicious and that I should stay put and not respond. She hardly knows this particular relative and how of the blue she sends a message after a long time.So at this point she removes me off social media. I didn’t like it but I accepted it. I decide to stay put but about a month later a friend informs be she has a new love and has plastered photos of them all over social media. I didn’t need this at this point. I was at the point of forgetting about her (or so i thought) and this guy tells me this, at this point. I felt really bad, I mean I felt a mix of emotions and I began to feel guilty about the situation. I can only imagine how things would have turned out if I took the “lets remain friends option. I began blaming myself for what happened. If only I did this, If only I did that, If only I didn’t do that. My brain began to run in a needless circle. I constantly review old messages and texts trying to find out where i failed.I still feel horrible and guilty and I not sure why. I didn’t do anything wrong (at least I think I didn't) but try to love her the best I can. She broke our relationship like it meant nothing and moved on without a second thought. Why do I feel so guilty?I apologize for the long text. I even feel horrible expressing my problems on a website.Thanks for any help on the matter...",BobJ48,"Tue,08/21/2018-9:07am",Rob,"Rob,Oh brother, what a story !  Hearing about how well things went in the beginning, and then how things fell apart, I have a pretty good idea of how mysterious and increasingly unsettling that must have felt.  I'm sorry you had to go though all of that, but much of what you describe often is how it goes with EDs.  Things seem fine in the beginning, but simply the fact that they are in a relationship with someone can cause ED to rear it's ugly head, and bring along many of the things you mention.  Particularly the ""pushing away"" part. ""..I can only imagine how things would have turned out if I took the “lets remain friends"" option. I began blaming myself for what happened. If only I did this, If only I did that, If only I didn’t do that. My brain began to run in a needless circle. I constantly review old messages and texts trying to find out where i failed…""One thing to keep in mind though.  In any relationship, by definition only 50% of it is ours.  We can do a 100% job good with our half, and even then there's still 50% that will always be beyond our control.  So keep in mind the fact that you may not have failed at all.  Unless caring and being concerned counts as a failure, that is...I was surprised to hear that she's hooked up with someone new though.  The first thought that came to mind is I wonder how much she's told him about her situation, and how likely it is that this new fellow will find himself going through exactly what you have gone though.Because I doubt that she moved on without a second thought.  If I had to guess, she may feel that starting over with someone who *doesn't know* all of the things that you know… she may think that somehow that's going to be a factor in her getting better. Like somehow you are no longer safe to be with, because you *do* know those things, and you *are* concerned about her situation. The fact that you do know and care…that may be a reason why she want's to keep her distance. Of course people don't get better simply by surrounding themselves with people who don't know about their issues, but a part of their minds may believe that that that's what it's going to take. And really, I hope you won't feel bad for posting.  This stuff can really take a lot out of a person, and leave them worn out and feeling confused.  I know that's how it was for me with my friend.It kind of comes with the territory, it seems.

But the question of ongoing friendship  seems to hinge on not so much our caring desire to remain friends, but whether they will allow it. I had a GF once who I really liked.  Things were going along fine.  I knew that she had some issues ( that were much  like the perfectionism issues that people with EDs have) but I was accepting of that,  and then out of the blue it was suddenly revealed (to everyone, not just me) that she had lied and deceived me about a whole lot of *very* important information. Once that came out (her imperfection was revealed) it was she who withdrew from me, rather than the other way around. That was years ago now, and she lives far away. It was my hope that she and I could remain friends, but that's not really happened.  Not because I don't  care about her (I was more concerned for her than angry when I leaned about her deceptions) but because now I'm the person who knows all these things about her that... she'd rather not have be true.  So she keeps her distance.I'm not sure if this would be the case with your friend or not, but it might be.  A couple of times a year I'll send my friend an e-mail to let her know that I'm thinking of her, and I do get responses most times.  But it's pretty clear that she's still wary of the things that I know about her, even though she knows I've moved on. Bob J.",Robmacall,"Tue,08/21/2018-11:35am",This is just the thing.

As for the former, remaining friends for ten years sucked every piece of life out of me as I continued to love the girl and hope for some kind of rekindling of what we once had. This was a massive mistake. It's hard to hear though at the time when you would do or suffer anything for that person but walking away while the hardest thing in the world sometimes you have to do for yourself or it could have horrible consequences for you down the road which won't be worth it believe me. The best thing I think you can do is write her a very long and complete email of how you still feel about her. Just everything you ever want to say to her still that you haven't been able to or still want to and then leave it in her hands. That way you'll have some kind of closure and even though it could take a very long time to get over from here it won't be half as long as if you keep her in your life even in some small way which will mean a lot to you but may potentially be almost utterly insignificant to her. If you mean what you deserve to mean to somebody to her she will be the one to contact you to try again. If she doesn't you can't control that but at least you can know you've done and said everything you could.

Like that things really should have worked out differently, and I'm going to try and prove that they should have.   Which…may not be the best reason to keep pursuing things. Again, this is not to say we should not try and be friends, but I'd only take that approach if friendship actually was my only motivation.

68,mdkz137,09/21/2018,New Here ,"I'm new here, my therapist recommended finding a support group for caretakers and thankfully the National Eating Disorder helpline referred me here as an option.  And forewarning I'm just venting here right now.My wife has an ED (Bulimia, I think?) and now that the ED is out in the open and she's being treated for it it's a blessing, because that's great she's at least seeing professionals about it.  But I'm going to be really honest here.  Watching her binge eat, then purge, then binge eat again, then purge, sometimes 2-3 times in a single evening.... It's hard to say but it kind of grosses me out.  I go from starving to not hungry at all as soon as I see her start.  It's in her whole attitude, it's impossible to describe.  And every time I use the toilet to see even just hints of evidence of the purging. This just like really sets off my thoughts of it especially when I clean the bathroom every weekend and because of the frequency of purging it always looks disgusting.  I need to talk to her about this but I'm afraid of how to approach it in a way that won't trigger her.I feel guilty with feeling frustrated and frankly a bit disgusted by it because it's a disorder and I don't like the thought of making myself the victim, I want to help.  But there's ... nothing I can do for her it feels like. But lately I've begun to notice that I was coping in negative ways.  I was spending more than I should on a hobby that I could focus my free time on, because by focusing on the hobby I wasn't fixating on the eating disorder.  Which then creates more stress in the house and exacerbates everything.  Additionally in order to avoid facing *my* spending habits I was ignoring hers, and in 2 weeks she went through almost $1,000 of food.  Some of that was going out with friends which social interaction is good for her, but a lot of that was grocery shopping and buying a ton of easily bingeable food for home.  We shouldn't be spending even half that for 2 adults and a toddler in the home.  But her go to is to go grocery shopping.  It's like everything she does circles back to food.  everything.  I went to a therapy session with her (her therapist) and that helped in some ways but we didn't actually talk about the ED at all, and that's the main thing I had questions and concerns about.  But it's not my therapy so I didn't want to intrude...I talked to my therapist about it and a few things she's said are helping me come to terms:
1) It's a marathon, not a race.
2) The eating disorder is the tip of the iceberg, it's what you can see, but there's so many factors going into what's causing it.
3) Focus less on the eating disorder which you can't change, and focus more on the environmental triggers that lead her to the eating disorder behavior to see if affecting the environmental triggers helps.
4) ED's are commonly a way to get 'control' (this was just something that helped me understand)This is one long rant that's been sitting with me for a while so I apologize.",iwanttolive,"Sat,09/22/2018-10:16pm",mdkz137,"Hello and welcome to the forum.  I am someone who used to suffer from bulimia and almost died from it.   I also suffered from anorexia and overeating and binge eating.  Today I am free from all of these.  I am sorry you are having such a difficult time seeing your wife so ill.  My parent's felt similar to you as they watched me self destruct.  It is painful to watch and feel that there is nothing you can do.  The disgust you feel, I felt for myself.  I think your wife probably has similar feelings.  It is an addiction.  And without help it usually gets worse so I am glad she is getting help.  I feel for you.  I understand to a point what you are saying.  Do you ever talk about your wife's disorder with her, when she is not in a bad place?  Ask her what she needs from you, how you can help her?  What about another therapy session together where you actually talk about this in the session.  It makes things all the more difficult when you can't share together and be honest with each other.  I am not married so I don't know how easy that would be.  But you can't ignore your feelings.  Have her clean the bathrooms.  Maybe you can do something she does in the house and she can clean up after herself that way it won't be a constant reminder to you of what is happening.  Does that sound feasible?  Eating disorders are so complex and difficult to treat.  But people do recover.  I am in recovery after a very long time of suffering.  I felt so bad about myself and what I was doing.  I am sorry this has been so painful for the both of you.   It is good that you are getting help yourself and that you are reaching out here on the forum.  There is no need to apologize for your post.  That is what we are here for.  It is upsetting.  It is frustrating and it is scary.  It is good that you are getting your feelings out and working through them.  I would ask your wife if she wants your help, and how you can help her.  I would also try to have real life go on.  Talk about everyday things that don't revolve around the eating disorder.  See if you can do things together that don't involve food.  And remember, bulimia is an illness.  A mental illness that is difficult to overcome. But it can be done.  I wish you the best and hope you let us know how things are going.

70,dan_man,08/18/2018,Relationship has come to a halt,"Hello everyone,I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for almost 4 years now. We're both 30 years old. About a year and a half into our relationship I discovered that she's got an eating disorder: she had very selective eating habits. In the summer of 2016 she had lost a lot of weight and was all skin and bones. From what I know now this must have been a relapse. She's struggled with this condition since high school.Ever since I noticed, I read a lot about Anorexia and went to see a professional for advice. By now, I know about it's symptomatic nature, that an underlying perfectionism and need for controll is probably driving it - and also how (not) to mention it/interact. Shortly after we had our ""first talk"", she told me that she's been in therapy since '14. An analytical type of therapy that tries to get to the ""root"" of things, i.e. you understand why you are doing certain things. As of autumn last year, she ended therapy (health insurance here only pays for a limited amount of time, apparently) and said she wanted to give it a go as she had learned strategies of how to deal with it.Over the last years she'd shared a lot of details about her condition with me that she had not shared with anyone else yet and I really appreciate her openness and her trust.We don't live together (~30 miles apart) and see each other once or twice a week. I know that she goes to the gym, running or to spinning classes four times a week and our dates are aranged to fit this schedule. There's never been anything like meeting up sponateously.During the first 2 years of our relationship whe had a reasonably normal intimacy. At the beginning it was even passionate. This, however has been on a steady decline. The last time we were physically close was in mid April or so. It's not only the lack of it that's bothering me but the apparent absence of her need for intimacy. When we walk, she refuses my hand, when I try to touch/kiss her, she turns away. When we kiss goodbye ond sundays, it's just a peck without eye contace and when I smile at her, her response is only casual and she looks away. The utter lack of emotional closeness (also of physical intimacy but most importantly of empathy) is really bothering me.When we see each other on the weekends, we head from café to café to bar to cinema and it feels as if we are not doing things together but as two separate people. It feels as if theres a concrete wall around her. Our one-week vacation was the same and the atmosphere was terrible.When I ask her about something we've talked about before, she's oftentimes curt and condescending. She's certainly right in criticizing me for being unorganized and, at times, forgetful. When things don't go her way, I'm given the silent treatment and she locks up. I usually apologize or try to work out what's wrong.She initiates a ""talk"" or tries to work things out in a conversation only very rarely.
Then, sometimes she apologizes and says that she knows she's being to perfectionist, that she's always been like that (also in previous relationships).I often get the impression that she doesn't love me as I oftentimes feel like a mere companion. I've mentioned this.Also, that she enjoys the time with me very much and that she wants me around, that she loves me and that the reason for her being unresponsive/silent is that she's simply burnt out and doesn't want to do do/say anything. We've talked about moving together. I think that this could result in us splitting up. She said that it could bring a little normality in our relationship as we wouldn't need to make the most of the few dates we have.Meeting friends also seems to be difficult for her. A couple of days ago she said that this is often stressful for her as such ""quality time"" could be spent doing something productive (i.e. sports, work) and that it always involves having to eat something. Then, when we spend our evening in town or when we're at her family's, she eats enormous amounts of food and sweet stuff. Sometimes she orders two main courses at the restaurant. She also smokes a lot since her relapse.She says that her perfectionsism, and hence, her eating disorder is a part of her, that it's ""the way I am"". When I'm with her, this drives me crazy and I am oftentimes very frustrated as I know that I can't really do anything against it. I also know that the want for change should come from her and that I can't force/urge her to do so. I don't really know what I should do. I've been thinking about ending the relationship a lot, especially after our last vacation and when there's been a particularly silent weekend. But after a couple of days into the week and emoji-laden whatsapp-conversations this thought wears off.How should I approach her and tell her to get back to therapy, maybe try another type of therapy? What can I do so our relationship becomes healthier, more intimate for both of us without making it feel like an obligation for her? Should I hold out the prospect of ending the relationship as in ""me or your condition, your call""?
I find it hard, if not impossible to accept her attitude towards her condition, i.e. ""this is how I am/this is a part of me"".",BobJ48,"Tue,08/21/2018-10:16am",Hey Dan...,"Dan,Sorry that your post sat here for a few days.  I hope you'll see this reply.So first off, I don't know how much the professional you saw mentioned this, or how much your reading mentioned it. but the relationship pattern you mention is extremely common.  Things seem fine to begin with, but with time and with increased intimacy, things go through a puzzling reversal, and rather than becoming warmer, the relationship becomes increasingly cold instead. I've been on forums like this for a dozen years or more, and I can't begin to tell you how many times I've heard this exact same story, so if it's any comfort, you're not the only person to experience this exact same thing. ""As of autumn last year, she ended therapy...and said she wanted to give it a go as she had learned strategies of how to deal with it.""This really is an admirable goal. You rightly mentioned the control thing, and it's true : At some point they'll need to have control over the recovery part too.  Recovery can seem to be a sort of turn-around from the ED sort of control, but it can still involve the control issue.  And the perfectionism and all that.  Just as EDs are hard to shake, so are the control/perfection issues too.Except what's happening is that her ED is not gone, and she is still feeling it's draw. And despite whatever you may say or do, she knows you wish she would get better. The fact that she's not getting better (when perfectionism and control says that she should be getting a grip) nags at her, and the relationship ( and your reasonable and caring expectations ) just serve as an increasing and ever-present reminder  her of how imperfect she is.  So she begins to withdraw, rather than becoming closer.None of this is your fault, and I really do hope you can believe that. It really is another one of those sorts of paradoxes that can come with EDs.  We believe that as with most relationships, our care and warm affection will serve to make things better, and yet they seem to make things worse instead.  But really, what's our better response ?  To act like we don't care ?  As I'm sure I don't have to tell you, the whole thing can seem impossible at times.""Then, sometimes she apologizes…""Yes, I can pretty much guarantee that she knows how hard this must be for you.  ""What can I do so our relationship becomes healthier, more intimate for both of us without making it feel like an obligation for her? ""You know, that really is the core question I think, because the ""obligation"" part plays a huge roll in all this.  She may feel  an obligation to not be a disappointment to you, and to be perfect for you.  After all, look at how earnest and caring you are.  But really, it gets back to the same old thing, she feels an obligation to be perfect for herself, and what with the binging and all, it's clear to her that that's just not happening.  So she's being a disappointment to both you, and to herself as well.  Which is not exactly the greatest atmosphere for intimacy. As you know, people with EDs can be terrifically hard on themselves, so that's part of it too.One thing you might say as a means to address this is ""You don't have to be perfect for me.""  That's going to sound like a cliche I know, but whatever you can do to get that point across may help things a little.   True, she'll still be battling her own personal expectations, but if you can convince her that you don't need her to be perfect for you…it may help clarify things a little, and take a little of the load off. The ""Dare to be Imperfect"" thing.  That's something she may want to think about too.In any case, I think you're seeing just how complicated and tangled the control/ perfectionism can get.  Like really tangled.  It's likely that she's aware of this too. As you said, therapy ( ""I need therapy? Another sign of imperfection !"" )  might help her untangle things a little , but as you also said, it will need to be her choice.   Dare to be imperfect, you know ?Bob J.",dan_man,"Tue,08/21/2018-1:16pm","Bob,","Bob,thanks for your insightful perspective. It certainly helps with the constant pondering about my own responsibility for the distance that has emerged. I'll have to let this sink in a little and see how I can get the message accross and understood.Just two days ago - to my surprise - she said that she's thinking about joining a meditation course as she's also struggeling with stress at work. She said she'd even consider dropping one of her sporty activities to do it and she asked me if I wanted to go too. I was really happy that she brought up something like this. You can bet that she never comes up with any suggestions of the kind without having already made intensive research. So I guess that we'll start in autumn!

71,JayWeb26,07/30/2018,I don't know what to do. I want to help.,"My girlfriend of 2 years has anorexia and i've been trying to help but i now realize i have no idea how to help her and things are getting worse and i think im making them worse. Im very concerned about her and i want to help. i'm not very good with these kinds of things (i'm not even very good at talking about emotions in general) so i came here because nothing i do seems to be working. it has gotten to the point that i'm very concerned for her health and wellbeing. Every time i vocalize these concerns and ask how i can help she minimalizes her disorder (she says she doesn't even have a disorder, it's not a big deal, etc.) and says i shouldn't waste my time worrying about her. Shes told me many times that she doesn't want to get better. She thinks the only way she can be happy is if she continues doing this to herself. I've tried to get her to see professionals and she said she'd try but that was so long ago and it's so much harder because she is a minor and still lives with her parents who don't seem to care, and not only that they won't let her see me. I also want to see her happy but if this is truly the only way she can be happy i dont think i can take it. any help or advice would be truly appreciated. i don't know what to do anymore, but there's not a chance i'll ever give up on her.",BobJ48,"Wed,08/01/2018-12:05am",Hey Jay...,"Welcome to the world of EDs.  Honestly though, all the frustrations you're dealing with are pretty much what everyone else deals with too.  We want to do some thing to help fix things, but as you are seeing, nothing we come up with seems to work.  Feeling helpless is not the greatest feeling it's true, but it's a feeling that we'll need to fight.  You're seeing the ""mental illness"" parts too.  It's like rather than getting better, she wants to get sicker instead. Because somehow that's what makes her feel happy ?  So what's with that ?   And could she somehow stop this all if she wanted too?  Maybe not.  So it really is a worrisome matter. And who knows what her parents think.  They could be in denial.  If you seem worried, while they don't seem to be, then that may be why they don't want you seeing her.  It can often take a long time for parents to truly come to terms with things. Maybe you've realized by now that trying to convince her to eat isn't helping things.  Or to not eat, or whatever her diagnosis might be. So you may need to look to other areas in which you can help her.   Here's an old saying about EDs : ""It's not about food"".  Which…of course food seems to be what it's about, and is to some extent, but it can be about deeper things too. But yeah, it's going to depend on what she feels safe about sharing with you.  Stressful things in her life, problems at home or at school. As well as how she feels about herself, and the kinds of self-doubts that she's struggling with. People with EDs often have a long list of self-doubts.  Not just the food and personal appearance stuff, but the stuff thats' underneath that. "" I've tried to get her to see professionals and she said she'd try but…""So…she could see the counsellor at school.  If she'd be willing to do that I mean.  Which she might not be. But you never know. No guarantees as to helpful they'd be, but school counselors should be pretty familiar with EDs.  And might have some suggestions for her.Anyhow, I suspect you're getting an idea of how emotionally tangled this stuff can be, so I hope you'll keep writing ?Bob J.",JayWeb26,"Wed,08/01/2018-12:38am",I've actually had some vague,"I've actually had some vague conversations with the school counselor about it but unluckily we live in a really hillbilly backwoods town and we go to a really small school. the school counselor told me she doesn't even ""believe in eating disorders."" that really pissed me off. When the counselor told me that i decided i should at least try to educate myself on these kinds of things since clearly nobody else around here cares enough to help without being a expert which her parents would never let her see. And as for her parents i guess i really cannot know their intentions but they've known not only about her disorder but also her self harm habits and have never even tried to talk about them with her. Also she's told me that there are things that shes just not ready to tell me and i respect that which is why i really wanted her to get to go to a therapist/counselor etc bc i know she has nobody else to talk to about whatever it may be.

Like there's the facts from science, and then there's my own personal opinion.  And hey, my opinion (which coincidentally just happened to serve some agenda of mine) is just as likely to be the truth as what the actual facts are. Unfortunately there's a lot of this style of thinking going on these days. "" And as for her parents i guess i really cannot know their intentions but they've known not only about her disorder but also her self harm habits and have never even tried to talk about them with her.""I work on a big forum for people with eating disorders, and you hear about this a lot. Parents who refuse to acknowledge that there's any sort of problem, even though it's clear that there is.  I guess it's the denial thing ?  Like if we don't pay attention, then somehow it will go away by itself.  Whereas if we do talk about it, then it's officially a problem, and something we'll then need to deal with.  So a lot of parents find themselves doing the avoidance thing it seems.  Which is not so great, because in some instances the person with the ED will intentionally do things to make themselves worse, in an attempt to get someone's attention. But she has your attention, and that's something.  Not that it's you're responsibility to fix her, so be practical and watch out for getting drawn into the rescue-fantasy thing. But being there simply as someone to listen…that's not really fixing or rescuing, but it can make a real difference. "" Also she's told me that there are things that shes just not ready to tell me and i respect that which is why i really wanted her to get to go to a therapist/counselor etc ""People can have some pretty intense and terrible things that happened to them in their past. You can use your imagination I guess. Stuff that they simply aren't ready to tell anyone about for various reasons.  Emotional or otherwise.  People can find themselves developing EDs later, in reaction to some of those things.   "" I told her that no matter what it is it will never change how i feel about her, and she can tell me whenever she is ready. ""Really, this is the best thing you could have said, so you're getting the hang of this. And if she does try and tell you, you don't really need to know all of the details.  Just that some bad things happened, you know ?  That you know how things like that can effect a person. "" i decided i should at least try to educate myself on these kinds of things…""That's one of the best steps you can take.  There are resources here on NEDA, and at other locations too.  There are forums for people who have EDs themselves, and to be honest, it wouldn't bum them out if you went there and asked them what they think you should do.  I've *never* seen anyone do that before, but people would probably appreciate that you took the risk to do that, and be willing to answer your questions.  I hope you will keep writing here too.

While it may seem like you are betraying her trust by telling her folks, sometimes we gotta look at the bigger picture and call in some outside help.  Because really, the main way that people with EDs die is indeed from suicide, so while I know there must be a lot of drama going on, it really is worth taking this seriously.You probably can count on her being angry, so be prepared for that, but there will also be a part of her that understands that you would not take a step like this lightly, or because you didn't respect or care for her.    I've had to blow the whistle on a couple of people who were feeling suicidal, to the point where the cops had to show up and intervene , and when things finally settled down a little, they never hated me for it.

72,BobJ48,08/14/2018,"Quietrock : Some of the ""Whys"" about Eating Disorders.","You wrote :   "" I had zero experience or knowledge about EDs before I dated my girlfriend.""Yes, I didn't know much about them either, and I think that's a pretty common thing for most people.  Which is strange, because EDs are the leading cause of mortally among women from 15 to 25.   I had a vague idea that it was some sort of self-punishment thing, but I think that you're seeing that it's much more than that."" I'm doing reading in my spare time as well but it all helps."" It does help,, and can  help us feel like we are at least doing something…even if it's just trying to educate ourselves. I literally had to build a new bookshelf myself."" I think the worst thing about it as a partner of someone who suffers is just feeling utterly helpless. I'm the kind of person that if there's a problem I do what I have to do to solve it "" No kidding. I think it's our nature as fellows to want to fix things. And we can have the ""rescue"" thing going as well. So when we come up against things that our actions can't fix, we can find ourselves  in a quandary for sure.  Those helpless feelings and etc.  Not a very comfortable place for us at all.  ""So when my girlfriend tells me something like she is actively trying to get sicker and has no interest in getting well it has taken time to realise she doesn't mean that ALL of the time…""This is a good observation.  Because it's been my observation that people with EDs go through periods where they hate the position they find themselves in.  And yet things will still come along that ""trigger"" them, and they retreat back into their behaviors again. In your reading, you'll want to pay attention to ""the control thing"", because (setting aside the biological stuff) that really is at the heart of the matter.  In the beginning, restricting takes terrific levels of self control.  And as time passes, that's an association which gets hard-wired into their brains, to a point where the association becomes instinctual.   So when things in life start seeming beyond their control. they find themselves going right into restricting again.  Over time, one of the things which can seem beyond their control is their eating disorder.  Ironic, I know, but that's one of the reasons why the thing starts perpetuating itself.  And why they can begin to feel trapped in some surreal kind of spiral. So on the one hand it's about control, but on the other hand it's out of their control. Which is when people with EDs really start feeling seriously bad about themselves and about their situation. ""I see how hard it is for her every day and the kind of things she has to do just to not have a breakdown.""Exactly. Imagine the quandary they find themselves in. So when fixing won't work,  we need another another strategy. Maybe it won't fix things, but it still can help.  What I mean is, there's ""fixing"", and then there's ""support"". And support can stem from the fact that you ""get it"" about some of the mental things  that they find themselves going through.  Because they can feel pretty alone with those feelings, you know ? This is getting long, so I'll close for now, but hopefully these are a few things to think about.Keep writing ?Bob J",Quietrock,"Tue,08/14/2018-8:31pm",Paying the toll,"Firstly thanks Bob for your ever thorough and insightful responses. In the short communication we've had it's already helped me a lot just to talk about these things that I can't with my girlfriend for fear of triggering her or upsetting her. I don't really know anyone outside of her I can talk to so it's been almost a kind of relief. I agree that support and listening are much better and more helpful/realistic goals than trying to fix things, which I don't think anyone could ever do. You can't convince someone with an ED out of an ED with logic as there is nothing logical about what they go through. It often goes against even their own internal logic, so how can you possibly attempt to rationalise a thing like that. It would be pointless and detrimental to try in my opinion. (And believe me I have in the past.) One of my biggest struggles in this has been trying to figure out a way to coexist with my girlfriend without actually unwittingly enabling her negative behaviours which then saddles me with guilt myself. The source of many of our arguments stem from my resistance to actively support the negative behaviours. As she studies and doesn't work.. all the money earned comes from me and that relinquishes a certain amount of control from her in the very nature of things which no one can help. My issue is that if she's not heavily restricting food, she'll be going through extreme binge periods and will send me out to buy her binge food which of course she will end up following with all the negative ED behaviours we all know. I struggle with agreeing to buy her these things or giving her the money to do so and instead fill the house with nutritional things that if she does binge / purge them are at least somewhat healthy. I bend on some things like the ungodly amount of beverages she consumes but I find it very hard to just buy her whatever she feels like at the time, that she will later feel extreme guilt about and ultimately hurt herself over. She'll often borrow money and find a way to go out and get the food to overeat anyway but that somehow feels slightly less heart wrenching to me than knowing I was an active part of the process. All this said I still have no idea what the best way to deal with being the person that pays for or brings her food is. I'm just trying my best here to both live with myself and help her. As for therapy I've been encouraging that for a long time now and she's even agreed to go in but every time the letter comes in the mail with an appointment time she'll freak out and postpone it saying something like, ""It's better someone else take my spot who really needs the help."" or ""I'm still too fat to be considered anorexic"". I keep trying to low key encourage her to go but I'm starting to give up on that, I really don't think she's at that point yet.Anyway I'm rambling myself in the night now :) Appreciate the words Bob.",BobJ48,"Wed,08/15/2018-4:14pm","""Unworthy / Undeserving""","You wrote :""...but every time the letter comes in the mail with an appointment time she'll freak out and postpone it saying something like, ""It's better someone else take my spot who really needs the help."" or ""I'm still too fat to be considered anorexic"". ""Honestly, if I had a dollar for every time I heard people on the forums say these exact same things I'd be wealthy. People feel like ""fake anorexics"" and  other people are always more deserving of help than they are.  Almost like they are robbing others of a chance to be helped if they should get help themselves.My response is usually : ""Sometimes it gets to be our turn"".  Which really is the truth.   Plus the part about ""not being sick enough yet / fake anorexic""…that sort of thing is not measured by numbers on a scale, it's measured by the sorts of disruption it's causing people mentally, and the disruption it's causing in their lives and relationships.I can understand your worries about ""enabling"" too.  It's really not fair for her to  expect you to go out and buy binge food for her.  Yes, people have to eat, but it's just plain wrong for her to wrap you up so intimately in that.  Something I suspect she might agree with.  While there's no easy solution to this, I do think you'd be right in asking her to do her own shopping.  The outcome may be the same, but she'd be the one taking responsibility, rather than asking you to share in it.   How you'd work something like that out is hard to say,, but again, perhaps she'd have some suggestions of her own.  <— Her suggestions = part of the ""taking responsibility"" thing.But yes, the financial end of things.  The person I knew would forge checks and use other people's credit cards to buy binge foods, so the level of compulsion can be pretty severe in situations like this.  In the end, she'll have to be the one to label these things ""a problem"".  And once she reaches that point, she'll need to start thinking about what she'll need to do to begin addressing it.  Not to sound alarmist, but killing herself is not an acceptable solution. (The leading cause of mortality in EDs is suicide.)  So thats' probably something you guys will have to agree on at some point too. If it were me, I'd keep pushing the therapy thing.  If she worries about the food angle, then she could go as a means to try and figure out what to do about the other relationship issues you guys are having.  Or to address whatever depression she's probably  having.  It doesn't have to necessarily have to do with eating disorders to begin with.I mean really, would she contend that there are no problems in her life which are worth talking about ?I'll bet she wouldn't.  And it's not like therapy is some kind of punishment.  It's more of a way to help figure things out, which she might agree  can be a valuable thing sometimes.

A person with EDs answered my post, but then she and I started emailing each other.  After about a year of us corresponding, she started a recovery forum on Yahoo Groups, and said she wanted me to be on it. So that's how I got on the forums, and how I learned about people's self-experiences.   After several years of that, I realized that I could go back to the ""Partners"" forum on SF, and help answer some people's questions there (by then they had banned people with EDs from answering questions on the ""Loved Ones"" forums)  which I did for ten years until Fishy finally went under.  In the mean time, my friend passed away from her ED.  Other people would ask me to join their ED forums too, so I was on forums for people with EDs, as well as the Fishy forum for partners at the same time.  I'm on the big ED forum currently, and was on the big one before that, and am generally friends with the mods from those places, so….that's kind of it.  If I can add anything positive to the whole situation, that seems like a worthwhile thing to do.  It's also nice to be part of a community where everyone tries to help each other, which is not always something you find in real life.

74,richard123,08-07-18,"Eternally lost, confused and heart broken","First time poster, long-time lurker here. I’m 38 and my wife is 36. We met in college and we’ve been married 10 years and have been together for 15. We also have two young children ages 3 and 5.This past year has been a downward spiral for our relationship. Last August she began a down-roll spiral after having a fight with her mother (who constantly criticizes her and tells her that she is not a good mother). She has always struggled with eating issues. She would use eating disorder behaviors. However, last summer she started losing more weight and admitted that she was sexually abused as a child by her father (she still sees her father frequently, which baffles me) and was verbally abused by her mother. She started seeing therapists and for the last month has been in IOP for her eating disorder. She has gained weight; however, she is now on multiple anti-anxiety medications and was previously addicted to pain killers (she was hooked after having several dental surgeries caused by tooth decay from excessive spitting) and has started losing some of the weight she gained. Therapy hasn’t been easy. Initially I thought that things were improving; however, in June she announced that she wanted to move-out and separate. She stated that she wanted independence and wanted to live on her own. She found an apartment and I helped her move in (I am not sure if I should have). She stated that I was her caretaker for most of our relationship. In retrospect, I agree that for the last several years I was her caretaker instead of an equal partner. I think I became numb to all the spitting and treated her more as a child instead of a partner (which I regret now). Last month she called her parents over to our home and announced in front of them (with me present) that she doesn’t love me, that she never loved me and wanted an immediate divorce (90-day mutual consent). She doesn’t want alimony or custody, just a divorce and the ability to come over to our home on a set schedule (set by her) to see our children. She also stated that she only married me in order to feel protected. She also maintains that she feels no emotions for anyone except our two young children.I am normally a reserved person and due to my own childhood experience was not an outward loving person for most of our marriage. I doted more on my children than my wife (that has changed as my wife and I have not had any intimacy (e.g. hand holding, kissing, etc) for the last year and I have felt neglected). My wife’s statements and intentions have been devastating. She wants a divorce, I do not. I have pleaded with her to try marriage therapy; however, she doesn’t believe it will help. I told her to journal and try to figure out all of her triggers. She is adamant about divorce. I understand why she may feel that way; however, it’s so hard to swallow. I love my wife more than anything and would do anything for her; however, I fear that I have lost her to ED. I have been an emotional wreck for the last several weeks and yesterday decided to write her a rather lengthy letter detailing my thoughts, emotions, and apologized for letting her down in our marriage. I told her that I would always love her and that I wouldn’t prevent her from divorcing me if that meant she would find happiness. However, I don’t want to lose her. I also don’t want to be a trigger and contribute to her ED. I feel like I am in a permanent state of purgatory. I asked her to speak to her ED therapist to see about a trial separation in which she has no contact with myself, our children or her parents to see if she still has triggers (I read this on another site. I can also see her anxiety levels jump when our children whine or have temper tantrums). She is going to see her therapist tomorrow to discuss this. However, she stated that it won’t change her mind about divorce. Currently, she comes over after work most nights and spends the night with me. She also wants to do more things as a family. It’s as if nothing has changed (sans the intimacy).  My brain tells me to keep fighting for her; however, my heart is telling me that it’s too late and to just her go. I am so confused and just needed to vent. I want her to be happy and healthy yet at the same time I fear that she will sink even further. Thank you for allowing me to vent.",BobJ48,"Wed,08/08/2018-12:40pm",Richard,"I'm sorry that things have come to this. I can only imagine how trying this must be for you.I suppose there's hope in her seeing her therapist. Separation sounds like a less drastic course than divorce.As you said, if you do separate, she'll get to see how much difference it does or does not make in the ways she feels about things.  And how much more full of life she feels when you are out of the picture, and it's just her and her ED.  I'm glad you took the step to write her.  She'll have the chance to read what you've said in private, and have some time to think about how she wants to respond.  Rather than just being impulsive with her reactions, as might otherwise be the case if you said these same things to her face to face.I know you feel bad for her though.  People with EDs often struggle with depression too, which can be a really hard thing to beat, and can have a real influence on their outlook and the sorts of decisions they make. It's a tough situation though, when we've done all we can, and yet that's still not enough.  Which really can be how it is sometimes : Even when we do 100% (or as close as any reasonable person can) with our half of the relationship, it can still not be enough to bring about the changes that need to happen.  And really, I hope that you can draw some bits of comfort from knowing that you are doing your best with your 50% of the relationship.  Pretty much by definition, the other 50% will always be hers, and something that's out of your hands.In the mean time, it does seem like how things evolve is going to be up to her.  That's not much comfort I know, given the things you've heard her say, but it's probably wrong to think that she has no investment in your relationship, despite her protestations, and even if she seems to have gone emotionally numb.  That sort of numbness can be a feature of EDs too, and those who are suffering from it don't always make the sorts of decisions that they might otherwise make if they were not under it's spell. In any case, just some thoughts. I'm glad you were able to write all this out, and that if it seems to help, I hope that you'll keep writing.BobJ.",Recovery_Focused,"Wed,08/08/2018-5:05pm",I am so sorry to hear this. ,"I am so sorry to hear this.

Your situation is my ultimate fear of where my own relationship is headed. Often my girlfriend will blame our relationship on the reasons why she has gained or a myriad of other things. Any time she starts to actually recover there's this turning point where the ED brain takes over and sees any and all progress as an impediment or a betrayal of her illness and she starts to feel like going off to live alone so she can let the negative behaviours fully take hold. ""Starve in peace."" as she says. Hopefully that isn't what is happening here. In her better moments I realise she does love me even though she doesn't show it often and theres times where she sees that herself and it's enough to keep us together for now. It's the hardest thing being here for those we love with this awful condition and at times can feel like a sacrifice of yourself for very little in return. I just can't help but think in the worst times to just keep loving her. If I can do nothing else (and sometimes the situation is so helpless that I can't.. just keep doing that.) Whether you stay together or seperate for a time or for good let her know that you love her often and keep loving her. Wish you the best of luck Richard.

75,TroubledWife,07/28/2018,"Wife controls me, I've had to leave ","I am a 25 year old Woman, married to my female partner for 18 months. We dated for two years before getting married, everything was really good. I knew that she liked to ""eat healthy"" and enjoyed cooking - so did I, how wonderful!
In the last six months, she has become more and more restricted about which foods are ""safe"" and ""unsafe"". It all theoretically made sense, but as time went on it was out of hand. At the same time, she was very restrictive about which brands of other foods we could buy. If we were shopping together, she would say ""pick up some X"" and I would, then she'd check the label and select a different brand. If I couldn't remember which brand we were ""supposed"" to buy, I would just stop picking up food.
Both of us dropped in weight, and I began to crave ""bad"" foods. I would stop on the way home from work and buy something to eat, because I was so hungry. I felt very guilty about this, as I knew she wouldn't approve, but the hunger was overwhelming. She knew how much I was eating, and would say she could smell the bad food on me (I don't think she really could, because she wasn't consistent and would accuse me of eating bad food when I hadn't been). I became more secretive, washing my hands and face. Yet, I was still losing weight - though my BMI never dropped to ""underweight"". I was frustrated as my clothes were too loose, and I had been happy with my body. Now I was hungry and guilty all the time, my clothes looked bad and I felt very alone. She was also very evangelical about her choices, so that if we met with friends food was all she would talk about, dominating the conversation and making it impossible for other people to talk. If we were arranging to meet a group of people she'd want me to ask them ahead of time whether they were eating/ what they might order. When I refused, she'd be very upset and cry.
After a few straight nights of fighting a few weeks ago, and me telling her about the cravings I was feeling and that I couldn't keep eating the way she was eating, I left to stay with a friend. I've seen her a few nights since, and she's dropped to significantly underweight (she was always boarderline). At her house a few nights about I came around to help with the dogs and saw that black mould was growing on dirty dishes in the sink - she's always been a very clean person and the rest of the house is clean. I cleaned the kitchen up for her, and found that the fridge and cupboards were nearly empty. She doesn't see that there is a problem, is very angry with me for leaving but maintains that my eating is the main problem here - that I'm addicted to other stuff and that she can't live with ""bad foods"" in the house, or knowing that I'm eating them outside the house. Now that I'm gone, I'm worried that she was faint or hurt herself without someone there to watch her.
Any advise or kind words are hugely appreciated.",Jennalee,"Mon,07/30/2018-11:56am",I'm so sorry you're going,"I'm so sorry you're going through this! Sounds like it's been a painfully rough ride. We have a lot of similarities in our experiences. I also met my partner as someone that said they lived a ""healthy lifestyle"" and it slowly degraded.
So good that you put a boundary down to protect your own health and mind. I really hope that she realizes that the number game is not worth losing lives small happiness.

When we're in the midst of the drama, it can be easy to lose our perspective.  The situation is legitimately serious, and we get drawn in.  I think that's just how it goes sometimes. I'm glad that you are gaining perspective now. While we can still feel upset, at least it's easier to feel some confidence in the things that we are upset about.  If that makes any sense I mean. BobJ",BobJ48,"Mon,07/30/2018-3:07pm", Troubled Wife,"If it's gotten to where you've had to move out, one would think that she'd be able to understand that there might be some problems that extend beyond your tolerance for ""bad foods"".   But this is just how it can be with orthorexia ( a fear of ""bad"" foods ) and with eating disorders in general.By that I mean that the person's mind becomes overcome with thoughts of food, and as you have seen, it can get to the point that that's all they can think about during their waking hours.   In fact, when people with EDs finally decide it would be good to think about recovering, this is often what they'll point to : They can't stand the fact that that's all they think about all day long ; Food.   They realize that maybe they would have a fuller life if they were able to fee up some space in their minds to be able to think about other things.From what you've mentioned, it seems like she's really stuck in that spot.  Where her mind is overwhelmed by thoughts of food and eating, 24/7,  and doesn't have time to think about anything else. What they fear will happen if they, or those they care about, should happen to eat ""unsafe"" foods is hard to say.  But one thing is sure : ""The control thing""  which people with EDs will tell you plays a *huge* role in EDs , is something she's deeply concerned about too. What you can do is hard to say.  It doesn't sound like she's able to have much insight into her situation,  or the ""negative side effects"" that her eating habits have brought with them.   Having your partner move out…you would think something like that would get her attention, but it just goes to shows the strength of grip that EDs can get on a person's mind.If you need to communicate with her, you might try writing her a letter, rather than confronting her in person.  That way you'll get to say what you want to say, and you'll know that she's heard you.   Which doesn't always happen in face to face situations.  She'll have time to consider what she want's to write you back as well.  If she does write you back. Do you think she'd be open to couple's counseling ?  Surely she doesn't think everything between the two of you is fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know I can't stop her behaviours or fix her so I tend to stay out of her decisions because I know there is nothing I can do. I've woken up or seen her leave and insisted I come with her but have always been met with hostility and her storming off into the night. My concern of course is for her safety. We live in a very rough and dangerous area, rife with stabbings and worse and a young woman walking the streets alone at these kind of hours, it's a miracle the worst hasn't happened already. I just really don't know what to do. I'm not happy with her going out alone like this. I've told her as much and she doesn't care. I totally empathise with her condition I know it's not her fault.

If you feel that everything is not fine in the relationship, then by definition, things aren't fine.  And ""It's your problem"" is not a statement that does anything to negate that.

77,Jennalee,07/27/2018,I dont know how to do this,"I'm so scared and exhausted from this journey. My partner of 7 years has struggled with ED since she was 15. We are 36 now. For the first 5 years of our relationship the disorder seemed to be dormant.. probably because she was working 65-70 hours a week... once that changed and she was no longer being a work-a-hokic she began compulsively working out and reducing her food intake.
My heart is hurting so bad... I was so hopeful that I would get my partner back when the work hours reduced and we could start making our life together..but really she just went from over working to overexercising and restriction..while trying to cover her E.D. with the goal of doing a triathlon..I'm not handling it well.  Every time I try to talk to her about it and get some empathy as a partner of the disease, she just gets defensive, tells me to withdraw energy from her so I dont care so much or feel so hurt. She doesnt see that when she is engaged with the E.D. there is no space for her to be emotionally available.. I end up either angry and over talking at her or just crying... hoping she will hug me or offer some sort of emotion..but normally she just stands there and looks at me, seemingly annoyed that I have emotions about her eating disorder. I'm finding that all of this is making me anxious, depressed and questioning my own body.. it doesnt feel good or sustainable..
I dont know how to handle this better..",BobJ48,"Sun,07/29/2018-4:17am",Jennalee,"""Every time I try to talk to her about it and get some empathy as a partner of the disease, she just gets defensive, tells me to withdraw energy from her so I dont care so much or feel so hurt.

And robs the both of you of.   It's interesting that the strategy she suggests you use ( that of turning off your emotions) is pretty much  the same strategy that she's been using to deal with things herself.  Maybe that's not the proper thing to say about her, but it's true that people with eating disorders often have negative feelings towards emotionality, and can use their behaviors as ways to avoid emotional feelings. What are they trying to avoid ?  People with EDs often are perfectionists, and fight against the feeling that somehow they are still not good enough. Not good enough at work, not fast enough in their sport, not thin enough, and just existentially good enough as a person.   It's possible that she's no longer aware of these associations, and these behaviors have simply turned into habits now, but when she was younger it's possible that this is what she worried about. Not being good enough, or having other dangerous thoughts or emotions or memories that needed to be avoided. So yes, you do have to wonder how much insight she has, as far as her situation goes, and how it might effect others. It is possible to have that sort of insight, but first you need the idea that there there may actually be a situation that calls for insight. "" but normally she just stands there and looks at me, seemingly annoyed that I have emotions about her eating disorder…""So what about the idea of couples counseling ?  Because it sounds like things are not at all great in your relationship right now. Maybe she doesn't think that she has a problem, and so there'd be no reason for her to need that.  But you clearly have an issue, so perhaps she'd go as a way to help you work out your own problems within the relationship ?  Do you think she would deny you that help, if you asked her ?A bit of reverse psychology I know, but there's no doubt that you actually do have some issues within this relationship, and actually would like to see things get better.  In ways that will require her help.  So that's a legitimate reason to ask for her help I think.Because it really does sound like the two of you are stuck right now, and that it's unlikely that the two of you are going to work it out on your own, which is a good reason to seek some assistance.Keep writing ?",Jennalee,"Sun,07/29/2018-10:21am",Thank you for your reply,"Thank you for your reply.

Was also an excessive alcohol drinker at night which lead to what I called black outs and eventual physical attacks on me along with heavy emotional put downs of who I am and my character.  The drinking has since stop after neighbors called police on the screaming he heard.  I kept my mouth shut and allowed them to take me so my children’s mom and my wife wouldn’t have to be in jail.  Of course there was no case against me so I just had spend night in jail.  I am thankful because that was a rock bottom catalyst to have her give up drinking.   However she has suffered with ed since her preteens.  I have tried do my best to educate myself, be patient, be understanding.  I have had limited people to talk to because it must remain a seceret and no one that has any experience with ED.  I know I haven’t done the best at it by far.  I suffer from depression based off abandonment and not good enough created during my adolescence.  Everything I’ve read talks about possibilities of sufferers of ed also displaying narcissistic behaviors, controlling people mood swings anger.  Our relationship has been extremely rocky and unhealthy. I’ve spent a better part of it in fear of her leaving me.  Based off her always telling me she is or we need to split up or be done.  It’s not working for me anymore etc. Of course it hurts me to the bone because I’m afraid of abandonment and losing her.  She controls and questions everywhere I go, how long I’m gone.  Makes accusations about every female coworker I’ve had.  Gets extremely anger when I try to share my feelings or talk about my depression.  I really confused because she blames me for almost everything, uses things against me for months until something else happens.  I’ve almost always believed and felt like I’m the problem in the marriage and was responsible to be one to apologize or beg for forgiveness.  I go to regular counseling, on medication for mood depression.  But nothing has changed at home.  I seriously feel like my wife hates me completely in and out.   I don’t want to give in give up.  I don’t know how to help her, nothing I do is good enough for her.  She doesn’t listen to me, criticizing her for actions is big no no.  Just makes everything worse.  I love her so much but truth is I’m scared to death of her.  And she pregnant now with our 2nd child.  We have 3 kids in home.  I feel like she manipulates the children against me.

So yes, what's her situation ?   People with eating disorders can indeed be irritable and cranky, but somehow this seems like something more than that.

As you said, people with eating disorders can display other sorts of emotional behaviors too, so it's possible that there's something more than just an eating disorder going on. Has your counsellor mentioned the possibility that she may have a personality disorder ?

And that you don't deserve her treatment towards you, no matter how she may try and twist things around.

79,drlemur,07-06-18,Girlfriend in distress,"My girlfriend has a pretty extreme eating disorder. I am from Australia, she is from London. We met online and we were friends for a year until  we become involved and I blew up my life and sold everything I own to go to London and take care of her. I thought things would be better once I was here but it feels like they are worse. I really love her and I don't know what to do to help. It seems like any encouragement I try to give only makes her worse and emotionally it's really hurting me that she isolates herself and pushes away from me during her binge / purge cycles. I only want the best for her but constantly I am the bad guy and we fight all the time and it's always around the subject of her ED or food. Sometimes she won't even drink water for days and me encouraging her to try only makes her rebel against that more. I really don't know what to do anymore to help her. She won't seek help and thinks she's fat but she's dangerously underweight in reality. Her main problem is she binges and then makes herself throw up and abuses laxatives constantly.. I stay awake with her as she goes through the pain. I can't stop her taking them she is very stubborn. Also she consumes an appetite suppressant. She often reports heart beat abnormalities and dizziness and her blood pressure is worryingly low. Of course she insists she is fine. Clearly she is not. I just need to know some of the best things I can do as I feel like a failure of a boyfriend and it hurts to watch her hurt herself but I feel the more I try to encourage her the more distant she becomes and the more our relationship suffers but I will not enable this behaviour or pay for her to binge when it only means she will harm herself after. I love her more than anything but I feel like she wants to keep her disorder more than she loves me and that really hurts because it is literally killing her. I don't know how anyone here could even help at this point but just hearing from someone who understands the toll this kind of thing takes on a partner would really help me personally I think. She doesn't appreciate any of the things I do for her or the fact that I care about her health and that is really hurtful.

We come to the thing feeling that that will be part of the solution, but then it's like this instead. I said ""On the surface"" though.  About how your care seems to not be making any difference.  While I may be sounding too optimistic, it may be making a difference that's difficult to see at the time.  That may sound like hogwash, and perhaps part of it is.  But she* is* hearing the things that you say I assure you.The question for you is how much of this you can be expected to live with.  I suspect you see how much it is hurting you.  You are not being oversensitive about that. It's not odd if you should feel like getting out of there sometimes.   Lot's of guys in your position get therapy of their own.   It's something to consider if you get the chance. Again though.  Remember that she probably hates the bulimia, and that she does have concerns about the heart irregularities and such.  If she's in touch with other people who are bulimic too, they all pretty much know what the story is, so it's likely that she knows it too.You have a right to hope that she takes action. She knows that too, which may also explain some of the ways that she's acting towards you.  Keep writing ?Bob J.",drlemur,"Sun,07/08/2018-7:38am",Bob,I know she loves me and I know she is trying in her own ways and feels trapped by it all. I don't blame her for any of it I do understand what she goes through I'm just finding it difficult because I really want to help and often just feel like I'm saying the wrong things and triggering her off or in general sometimes feel she'd be better battling this without me and my attempts to help. She doesn't like me to eat in front of her or keep any food in the house which I understand is difficult for her to have around so I tend to eat out a lot.. but it's tough financially and not having the use of the kitchen for anything more than a cup of beverage. It's the only thing I've been able to contribute to that helps though so I am happy to keep doing that. The binging seems to trigger everything and she doesn't work so gets her money from me. I was wondering if it might be an idea for me to just buy all her food and have her plan what she will eat for the day before hand and I could then buy all the food for each day at a time and it might help control things. But I worry about even suggesting this because it might be too controlling or make things much worse to even bring it up. I always just try to think of practical ways I can help solve issues and I don't know how helpful that is in this case though.. I don't want to seem controlling so it's probably a terrible idea.,BobJ48,"Mon,07/09/2018-2:03pm",Choices,"""I really want to help and often just feel like I'm saying the wrong things and triggering her off …""Searching for the perfect thing to say is really too much to ask I think. And in situations like this, there may not even be anything that's perfect.   In the end, you do care, and despite what you may or may not find yourself saying, that's the part that's worth paying attention to most. And a thing I expect she understands too.  So try not to beat yourself up if somehow you're not perfect with all this.  You get to be a human being too, you know ?"" She doesn't like me to eat in front of her or keep any food in the house…""Again, at some point us humans have to be realistic about things.  It's unreasonable to expect there to be no food in the house, or for you to have to eat by yourself.  Or just not eat at all ? There's only so much accommodation a person can be expected to do I think.  If she takes your food, that's something that will inevitably need to be confronted at some point, rather than simply keeping food away altogether.   I know that sounds harsh, but ""going along"" with unreasonable stuff, you have to wonder how healthy that is in the long run.  You'll both have to decide about that I think, as I know you don't want to seem uncooperative, but the issue is about more than just cooperation, as I suspect she might agree.And actually, it might be a good thing if you could try the meal plan thing.  With things planned out ahead of time, the person doesn't have to find themselves constantly up against the food-choice thing.  She may see it as too constricting, but at the same time, she might admit that food-chosing is a trigger in itself. Just some thoughts.   Keep writing ?Bob j.",drlemur,"Mon,07/09/2018-3:50pm",Food,Any food I buy for myself in the house will be gone before I get to it and soon after she'll leave the house to get a load of food to binge /purge so I always felt responsible for her being triggered off by having bought that food in the house to begin with. Maybe when I do buy food I could get it just before I'm going to prepare it if I'm not eating out alone. It's not like she demands I accommodate her in this way or keep no food in the house but she has strongly suggested that and I just see the results of what happens when I do stock the cupboards and it never leads anywhere good so I'd rather not.The hardest thing for me is that when she gets deep into her ED she just shuts down completely puts headphones on is on her phone and won't say a word to me for days and I'm someone who really needs to communicate. I have an instinct to want to sit and talk with her and try to comfort her obviously during the worst times but she doesn't want that at all she just wants to be completely alone and can be very cold.. which is the total opposite to her usual self so this contrast even though I know it's caused by the ED is very difficult not to effect me emotionally. I never know if it's best to leave her alone or keep trying to talk but I end up leaving her be and work in another room on my computer or watch TV elsewhere. It's very hard to do knowing the person you love is hurting themselves or in pain and you can't do anything about it or even be there to listen and help. I don't know if this is a common thing with people who suffer from EDs or just her but it's against the grain for me because I'm really close to her and we usually talk about everything. I want to encourage her to get some professional help but I just don't know how to raise the subject with her at all without making things worse. I think it's getting to a point where I definitely need some support and people to talk to about this outside of her. I am having a really difficult time with it all and it's effecting our relationship and I really don't want that.,BobJ48,"Wed,07/11/2018-2:54pm",Accommodation and Numbness,"Dan, ""Any food I buy for myself in the house will be gone before I get to it and soon after she'll leave the house to get a load of food to binge /purge so I always felt responsible for her being triggered off by having bought that food in the house to begin with.""Remember though, in the long run it's the ED that's the trigger, so try not to lay too much of this on yourself.   I know you understand this, but still, it can be easy to fall into the self-blame thing, and that's something you'll want to avoid.   For the good of the both of you, you know ?"" The hardest thing for me is that when she gets deep into her ED she just shuts down completely puts headphones on is on her phone and won't say a word to me for days…""Yes, and people with EDs will often talk about this.  ""Going numb"" is how it's often referred to.  Things get to be too much, so they just check out, and do everything they can to protect themselves from feelings or emotions.   On some level binging is sort of the same thing : They go off in that food trance, and are free from their feelings for a while.   For a while, that is.""  I never know if it's best to leave her alone or keep trying to talk but I end up leaving her be and work in another room on my computer or watch TV elsewhere. ""I suspect she understands that this is a problem for you.  And would admit that she understands during the better moments you guys share. So during those better moments, perhaps you guys could make a contract or something, where you agree to have…maybe 5 minutes or so when you will speak to each other, when she's in the middle of one of her withdrawing spells ? Because at some point she's going to need to start making some kind of effort to fight this stuff.   You rcan't reasonably be expected to hang around if she doesn't .   If she's making an honest effort to get better that's one thing, but if she's OK with just  rolling with it now…where does that leave you ?  What has she provided you with to support ?   You love her of course, but then again, perhaps you know what I mean ?Of course she might urge you to leave, but that would be kind of a cop out her part.   Like she loves ED more than she loves you ?I bet she would not want to find herself saying that, you know ?She might say that she doesn't want to be a burden on you, as many people with EDs feel that way too.  But that brings us back to whether she's making any sort of organized effort to fight this or not.   If she's fighting it, then there are reasons for us to put up with the bad times.  If they aren't, then that's different. Anyhow, just some thoughts.Keep writing ?Bob J.",BobJ48,"Wed,07/11/2018-9:57pm",Locks.,"This is probably a bit off topic, but I'm on another forum, for people who have EDs themselves, and are not necessarily trying to recover. There was a topic where someone mentioned that their mom had put a lock on their fridge.Here are the responses in order :"" My husband has always threatened to put a lock on the fridge during my bulimic phases. I kind of wish he'd do it."" ""I agree I wish My husband had a lock on our fridge! """"  there are so many times i wish there was a lock on the fridge. ""Would these folks throw a fit, and accuse their partners of not loving them if they actually did that ?  Most likely they would be really angry.  And really, it's *nothing* that I would recommend as it might imply that you are interested in controlling and perhaps bullying her.   I mentioned it mostly to show how despite outward appearances, many people are often of two minds about their situation, which is a thing that's important to remember.",drlemur,"Sun,07/15/2018-8:30am",Control,"Yeah that is a very good point. In her good times she often asks me to stop her binging but I'm sure if I actually did it would be a nightmare. I've never sought to control her or bully her about this issue in any way. The most I've ever done is while taking too many --------- I've said ""Please don't take too much.. how about a few less this time. I don't want you to hurt yourself or be in pain."" The thing is once she actually responded by taking less and another time she took more almost to spite me. So it's never easy to know what to say.. or when to keep quiet.",BobJ48,"Sun,07/15/2018-10:08pm",To spite you.,"I suspect she felt bad about that later, but it really goes to illustrate why this sort of thing is labeled as mental illness.  That sounds like a cold and  condemning term I know, but at the same time, the way EDs cause otherwise-good people to act in such irrational ways is something that's hard to ignore. It's good to keep in mind the control thing though.  The urges they have are directly related to that, but expressed in some pretty dysfunctional ways.   Even so, I think that all of us are comforted by the primal thought that we are controlling certain aspects of our life. It's something that's just human I think. How the food and weight thing gets so incredibly associated with the concept of control is probably a whole other topic, but somehow it does, and has imprinted itself in the person's brain with an intensity that becomes resistant to logic.  Even their own logic, you know ? ""I've said ""Please don't take too much.. how about a few less this time. I don't want you to hurt yourself or be in pain."" Well yes, and that would seem to be a logical thing to say.  But remember what I said about trying to put yourself in their shoes, when trying to craft a response ?  And how it might take mindfulness and practice ?"" I know things must feel pretty out of control right now, so I can understand why you might feel like taking those. ""OK, that sounds like you're trying to be Dr Phil or something I know, but still, you might try something like that next time, and see what response you get.  While it might not stop her from proceeding, it would show her that you're starting to get it, and that's always a good thing I think.

80,drlemur,07-10-18,Laxative abuse damage?,"My girlfriend has been abusing lax and suppressants and things for a very long time since before I met her even. I've always been worried about this but I can't stop her doing it obviously. God knows I feel like throwing them in the bin when I see them but I know this wouldn't help things any. I feel like any comment I make about them or anything else I do will only make the situation worse so I have to stand by why she hurts herself by taking way too many and it just feels awful having to do that. Sometimes she tells me she has taken too many and has been bleeding when going to the toilet but today she told me she's been bleeding for several days and it hasn't stopped. She collapsed in the shower after being too weak from purging yesterday and all of this behaviour sprang from a comment I made that she took the wrong way so I feel responsible for all of it and she's telling my friends (our mutual) as much who are furious with me and it's making me look like some kind of heartless abuser. In reality I really just don't know what to do apart from continue to try and avoid her triggers. She refuses to see a doctor about the bleeding and I'm really worried. I know this isn't a medical advice forum but has anyone else heard of this happening with lax abuse? She seems to think it's fine because it's happened before and she hasn't died yet but it's very hard for me to take constant rectal bleeding as ""fine."" Plus I know tonight it's just as likely she will take lax again and things could escalate further. I just don't know what to do or what the right thing to do here is. I just don't want to make things worse and I don't want her obviously giving herself permanent damage. Has anyone else been in this situation with a partner or similar and if so what have you done?",Recovery_Focused,"Tue,07/10/2018-10:28am",Laxative Abuse,"Hi,I would also be very concerned.

Not matter what our partners find themselves saying to us.""... so I feel responsible for all of it, and she's telling my friends (our mutual) as much who are furious with me and it's making me look like some kind of heartless abuser.""Well right.  Except how may random people are really educated about EDs, and how many of them honestly understand what you are being put through with her ?  Not many I bet.  While it's our natural inclination to sympathize with our friends, and feel sorry for the fact that they have a condition, I expect if they had to spend a few days in your shoes, they'd not be so quick to condemn you. "" She refuses to see a doctor about the bleeding and I'm really worried. ""As well you should be. And really, it's not that she thinks that it's nothing, it's more that she knows that she'll be called to answer for her behaviors if she does see a doctor.  Which…she knows that that's their responsibility, but at the same time, how is she going to explain to them that she can't quit ?  And if she should be able to, then what might come of that ?  Best just to stay away and avoid all of that.  Which is kind of understandable too. "" Anyway she has a very abusive family and no friends that aren't online ones so it's only me to encourage her to seek medical advice but she won't listen to me. ""I think I know what you mean by ""online friends"" as I'm on some of those sites too.  And while they may sympathize with her situation, I wouldn't be so sure that they aren't telling her the very same things that you are. Which might also explain some of her irritation. "" Half my problem with my girlfriend is me saying the wrong things…""Well maybe, but maybe not.   If you are saying ""you should do this, and you should do that"" then that may be the wrong approach.  Saying things like "" I can imagine that this must be concerning for you"" and things of that nature are better.   Like trying to put yourself in her shoes, and trying to understand her fears and frustrations, and then crafting your responses based on those understandings is the best way to go about it I think.  Even if it takes some concentration and practice to begin with. As you said though, you can't force her to go.  That's a risk that she'll have to take for herself.  Because yeah, when it comes to things like this, there really are a lot of risks they'll have to take for themselves, and that's another thing you can show her you understand too.Just some thoughts.

81,Newbie12,07-03-18,Dating Girl With Possible ED,"I’ve decided to delete my posts. I’ve come across someone with a very serious eating disorder. She’s probably had it her whole life, was probably exacerbated after breaking up with an abusive boyfriend a few years ago and worsened after getting sick from antibiotics a few months ago. It doesn’t help that she lives alone and probably cannot care for herself, has an alcohol problem, and has low self esteem. Most of this post will probably get deleted but I think it’s important to stress just how serious it is. This in not just some skinny girl who doesn’t eat much it is extreme. She will not live much longer like this there is no doubt.I’ve come to this board for help because I’m not equipped to help her and I haven’t gotten any. I was told that discussing specifics may trigger behaviors in a reader and then someone said you might want to try talking to her. Well gee, how is someone going to help me help without discussing specifics? And you don’t think family, friends, and co-workers haven’t tried talking to her? I told her basically that I need some proof that she’s trying to eat an appropriate amount before I can see her again.",Newbie12,"Thu,07/05/2018-5:02pm",I’m not sure how you can,Aa,natalie25,"Wed,07/04/2018-2:02pm",It can be a little bit,"It can be a little bit frustrating trying to describe the symptoms without getting too specific, but those specific behaviors and numbers can be really triggering for some people in recovery. When looking for support, those minute details don't matter that much, as we are all here to help each other.
I can see you care for this girl you're dating; posting on here is a great first step. Have you tried talking to her about your concerns? Is that something you feel comfortable doing? For some that struggle with eating disorders, there may be a chance that she denies that there's a problem, and think that you're judging her.
The forums have helped me so much in dealing with my own recovery, I hope that you also keep us updated!",Newbie12,"Thu,07/05/2018-5:02pm",We ended going out for kind,Aa,Newbie12,"Thu,07/05/2018-5:02pm","We had dinner together,",Aa,Savedbygrace ,"Fri,07/06/2018-11:30am",Suggestions,"Hello,
  I first want to say how sorry I am that someone you care about is hurting and suffering.  I'm sorry that you're feeling hurt and concerned regarding this individual.
  Eating disorders are really difficult to live with, not only for the sufferer, but for those who care about the person.
  That being said, I have some ideas on how to reword some things in your post so they are less triggering to those who read your post, as I am one of those sufferers on this post.
It is possible to post without using specific numbers.  For example, instead of saying X calories, you can she's eating very few calories.  Or instead of saying she weighs X lbs, as you did, you can say she doesn't weigh very much or is underweight.
  Instead of saying she has a BMI of X, you could say she has a very low BMI.
  I hope some of this is helpful.",BobJ48,"Fri,07/06/2018-6:20pm","Newbie 12,","Newbie 12,I understand your situation. If someone is in the medical field, it's natural to want to list the specifics. But here, if you say the the situation is bad, most people are going to understand just what you are talking about.Having said that, you are right : no matter how much we study up on the issue, if a partner has problems, they are our problems too, no matter how much we might feel we can distance ourselves through knowledge. Thats' simply the way of things I think, so if you feel unsettled that's only  normal I think.So yes, what can we do to add something positive to the situation ? One approach you might take is to try and put yourself in her shoes, and think about what might feel supportive if you were her.   Things like that can give us a different and better perspective on things I believe.    Also, if the situation has been acknowledged (has it?) then you might ask her what you can do to be helpful.   ""Nothing"" is likely to be her response, but I wouldn't let her get away with that.  Keep pressing, and she may admit there are things that you can do, even if that means simply listening when she's having concerns. Because EDs are usually about a whole lot of things besides simply the food issues.  Concerns about having control over their lives, concerns about self-worth and the like.  Concerns that many normal folks think about too. In any case, this is just a short response I know, but perhaps it has helped a bit.I hope you can keep writing.Bob J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
