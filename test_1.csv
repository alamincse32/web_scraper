0,EatingDisorders,Request: I’m triggered and depressed,"I decided to spend time with my friend for his birthday. I used to have bulimia and recovered from it. Took years for me to be okay with eating again.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend was looking at old videos of us from 2 years ago and said “back then when you used to be skinny.” And I’m honestly so hurt that my friend would say this to me knowing how insecure I’ve been about my body.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I feel so triggered. I want to go back home and forget about his birthday. I also don’t have anyone that I’d call a close friend. I feel so alone and misunderstood. How do I recover from this? Am I overreacting? Am I too sensitive? Idk",0.96,25,0,25,,2021-10-28T04:51:15Z,qhjgfo,t3
1,EatingDisorders,Request: 4 months ago I lost my appetite and everyday since I've been significantly under-eating,"The initial loss of my appetite was caused by depression, but I don't believe it to be the reason for why it hasn't returned.

Having no desire to eat often makes me forget about needing to. Usually I procrastinate eating until my body motivates me, but if I plan to be mobile I will in advance eat what I would've normally had later in the day.

I don't count calories but I know I don't consume anywhere near the recommended daily amount. I don't eat meals, only servings of snack foods (like a couple of nature valley bars or a yogurt) because they are easy/quick.

I think I still experience the common signs of hunger but became accustom to them. In general I feel fine, or maybe I'm just unbothered by the things I experience as a result of under-eating. After going for too long without responding to my body's requests for food, it'll motivate me to eat by inducing sudden nausea that causes involuntary gaging/dry heaving. It's pretty brief and I lay down for a couple minutes to make it subside before I finally eat something.

I was able to figure out that in these 4 months I've lost xx lbs (a lot). I was a little bit overweight before (I'm around 5ft9/5ft10) but I didn't have a problem with my body image, nor do I now. It surprised me when I did the math and found out how much weight I had lost. Especially because I haven't noticed a big change in my appearance and no one else has mentioned it to me.

I know that physically there's nothing causing this because I had a blood test and urinalysis in early September (for an unrelated reason). I was told all the results came back normal but the doctor didn't elaborate past that.

I'm not completely sure what I'm looking for by posting this. I guess maybe suggestions, hopefully ones other than the obvious ""just eat."" I haven't talked to anyone about this and I don't even really know what ""this"" is. Based on the information I've read from reputable and up to date health resources, I'm not sure that I have an eating disorder because my experience didn't line up with any of the different forms that were listed.

I appreciate any feedback and thank you for reading.",1,5,0,5,,2021-10-28T04:50:20Z,qhjg0o,t3
2,EatingDisorders,Request: How to ask for help," 

I’m a 36 year old woman in a high stress environment that is both emotionally and mentally draining. I have a fair bit of training in therapeutic models, such as Motivational Interviewing, Strength Based Problem Solving and work with individuals at creating safety. My problem is that I don’t know how to ask for help, and feel a bit of shame and embarrassment around my suspected ED. I have not been formally diagnosed with anything as I have not sought help, but my eating habits are problematic and likely akin to EDNOS. I do not binge, but will often purge after meals I deem “too much”, although there is no method/reasoning behind what I deem “too much”.

This has been pretty consistent for the last 7 years, although I did struggle with similar behaviours while in high school, which I did not seek help for either and just stopped (although I cannot state the reasoning for stopping or what worked to help me stop). My concern is I have been with my husband for 8 years and have been engaging in this problematic behaviours for the majority of it. I am able to hide these behaviours very well and he has no idea. I know he would support me, but I’m having so much difficulties pulling the trigger and accessing support through my Employee Assistance Program.

their eating habits is what concerns me the most. whenever we go out they eat very small portion or like three bits and state they’re full due to the gastric bypass.

they also have dizzy spells a lot and state it’s because of their “low blood sugar”. they state their body fluctuates their blood sugar due to them being previously overweight. i’m not entirely sure the medical accuracy of this. i could not find any info online related.

5,EatingDisorders,Request: Is this an ED? Am I overthinking about it?,"I've been overweight since I was a little girl. Even at 12yo when I was only a few pounds over my healthy weight according to my doctor, I've never feel skinny or been skinny. In fact, I was always considered the fatty girl of the class. Now I'm an adult with PCOS and still overweight. I take my pills daily and know the secondary effects of it. However, I've noticed something that just doesn't feel normal to me: I'm ""tired"" of food. Any food, healthy or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I eat two or three meals a day because I'm hungry not because I want to. When I'm completely stressed over something minimal I tend to eat fast food, like a burger and some fries and feel completely guilty afterwards. But what bothers me the most is that I don't even enjoy the flavor, the texture, anything. Right now I'm trying to continue with my diet and I usually crave the normal healthy food that I know that I like, but while I'm eating it feels disgusting. Even if I recognize the good flavor it's hard for me to chew it because I feel like I want to put it back on the plate. This happens with fast food too so I really can't say for sure if I wanted it so bad, because it tastes really gross.

&amp;#x200B;

After a good lunch, a healthy one and even well balanced in portions, my brain knows and tells me that ""I did well"" but my body tells me otherwise. The aftertaste of any food is still present and I can't enjoy any meal. After eating I always drink A LOT of water to feel ""clean"". The only thing I don't have a problem with are fruits... Fruits and water.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do because it's not only confusing but it's starting to make me feel stressed. Sometimes I end up crying while eating and I force myself to have at least half of the plate... or all I can, because I will feel worse if later I'm hungry again.",1,2,0,2,,2021-10-28T04:45:29Z,qhjdpe,t3

7,EatingDisorders,recruiting NYC area participants for research on a new type of treatment for self-harm," 

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). Eligible participants should be staying/living within 60 minutes travel distance of Manhattan (New York, NY, USA) to participate. The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and twelve sessions of tDCS during six visits over two weeks. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from your own home–no in-person visits are required.

Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

The researchers on this team have no conflicts of interest to declare. All study procedures have been approved by the Institutional Review Board for New York State Psychiatric Institute.

Some details about confidentiality and the use of your personal information:

*If you consent to participate in this research, your personal information will be kept confidential and will not be released without your written permission except as described in this section or as required by law.

*To make your personal research results not identifiable with you if they are used for publication in the scientific literature and presentation at scientific meetings, we will remove all your identifying information, including name and date of birth.*

*Questionnaire answers and data collected during the task may be used in future studies, and if shared with other investigators, information that identifies the scan, questionnaire responses, or task data with you will be removed beforehand. There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality from such data sharing, but this is extremely low as only de-identified data from this study may be shared.*

*Clinical records, including your name and other personal identifying information, and research data will be kept in secure storage at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Information in paper format will be kept in locked files. Electronic data will be protected by a firewall (programming that makes it virtually impossible to access the data from outside the New York State Psychiatric Institute) and by restricting access within the New York State Psychiatric Institute through use of a password known only to authorized personnel. If information is transmitted electronically, it will be encrypted so that your identifying information remains confidential*

*Records will be available to research staff, and to Federal, State, and Institutional regulatory personnel (who may review records as part of routine audits). Your information will also be available to other authorized individuals, including those at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. There are also legal advocacy organizations that have the authority under New York State law to have access to otherwise confidential subject records, although they cannot disclose this information without your consent.*

I always eat more than her (she can't eat a lot bc of a now smaller stomach), and now I can't even fit into her now clothes.

14,EatingDisorders,Request: Advice on supporting my partner," 

I'm wanting some general advice on if there is anything more I can do to support my wife with her eating disorder. We have reached a stage in our relationship where we are wanting to start a family, however, unfortunately she is not ovulating due to her weight and the amount of exercise she does. I can't begin to imagine what it's like for her trying to deal with things and I've done my best over the years to try get a better understanding through research, books and talking things through with her.

I have found it incredibly difficult to feel of any use to her because of how defensive she can be and how much she pushes me away when I feel like all I am doing is trying to be supportive. She has refused to see a professional due to past experiences and while I beleive she would really benefit from it I respect it's ultimately her choice. We have tried working through some ED workbooks and while this occasionally seemed to result in productive conversations it also caused arguments at other times, between us we made the decision for me to take a step back and let her try to tackle things on her own. I felt like while I wanted to sit and talk things through she seemed to want to find something to argue with me about to the point where she just made things up I hadn't done.

She has taken on a new diet plan from the PT at the gym she goes to and I am proud of her for taking these steps. So far though she has actually lost weight since starting it and I find it difficult to keep my positivity up. I'm extremely worried that in order for her to gain weight the adjustments to her diet and exercise routine will be far too difficult for her to take on alone.

Unfortunately I can see resentment starting to build up on both sides of the relationship. For me when I see her leave the house to exercise every day it causes me to feel deflated. I think for her I'm the one person ""getting in the way"" so to speak of her ED behaviour and the ED being allowed to do what it wants for an easy life if that makes sense.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated as i'm incredibly worried for the future if something doesn't change soon.",0.71,3,0,3,,2021-10-23T11:48:59Z,qe8j4a,t3

My therapist and I are closing our relationship because of my suicidal ideation, so I recently was sent an overview of our time together. One note really devastated me: “ \_\_\_ saw improvement in her life-sustaining eating habits”

I don’t know why it upset me so much. It just made me feel so sad to not be skinny anymore. It made me hyper-self-conscious about all my parts with fat on them, and it made me want to restrict. It also made me despair over my increased appetite, since I no longer feel like I can restrict no matter how hard I try. I know I should be happy about these changes, but really they hurt me so much.

16,EatingDisorders,Request: people I talk to about my habits think I have an ED but I don’t believe them.," 

I’m 24 and got diagnosed as prediabetic a bit over two months ago. I’m 5’1 and was formerly 163 lbs but after calorie restriction and exercise I’ve gone to 145 in 2 months.

a lot of the time I don’t even eat X calories (low) and when I see anything I deem “fattening” I start feeling really anxious and my heart almost pounds. I’ve always been overweight so I think this kinda precludes me from having anorexia or something although I’ve always been a binge eater.

i don’t like people seeing me eat bad food and so I avoid eating much at work and because I work late I end up not eating much at all. for example it’s night time and I’ve had about 300 calories today.

another thing is that if I mess up, I punish myself. For example on Tuesday I drank alcohol and then ate a bag of chips. so I’m staying under Y (even lower) for the rest of the week because I hate myself for doing that.

this is working for my weight loss and if anything I’m more energetic than I was before so i don’t think it’s disordered otherwise I’d have bad side affects and also I have only been doing this for 2 months.

17,EatingDisorders,Request: Any tips on how to survive a 9 hour shift while eating very little?," 

I have dysphagia and was recently diagnosed with chronic duodenitis. Basically, I digest food extremely slowly and I struggle swallowing most food and liquids. For a year I have lived on cookies, snacks, ice cream and rarely a pureed meal that I could handle.

Thing is as I await for my doctor to give me meds that hopefully make this better, I just got a job and I start next Monday. Because of my eating habits, there are times during the day in which I feel weak or faint.

My best moment is breakfast - I guess that is when the food has been digested and then and only then am I able to swallow food for a short period of time until I feel full. Then it's game over most of the day.

While I await for my treatment, is there something I could eat/drink (no solids) that could help me? I've been trying adding salt to my water and maybe Gatorade.

I'm also not american so pls don't recommend me a specific brand since chances are it doesn't exist here. I'm mostly looking for ""energizing"" foods that could help me get through the day.

18,EatingDisorders,Request: A message of hope," 

A message of hope for those feeling hopeless…. I've had a lifetime struggle with food. It gives me ease and comfort &amp; I use and abuse it. I try compensatory methods to then control my weight - excessive exercise, restrict, etc. I sometimes wake up and my first thoughts are on food or I dream about food. I'd have thoughts of eating a particular something when i wasn't even hungry. I'd want to just ""munch/eat"" something when anxious and wanting to avoid facing life/reality/my uncomfortable feelings. My closet was full of various sizes because my weight was always a moving target. It was a vicious cycle of using food to feel better - feeling awful afterwards, swearing off and coming up with a new plan to eat healthy, I'd have great results for a time, eventually I'd compulsively eat, after i was baffled how could i do this yet again. All the self-knowledge of nutrition &amp; strategies to eat right and exercise didn't work. All the years of ED disorder therapy didn't work. I tried umpteen other things: popular weigh &amp; pay programs, intuitive eating, other forms of talk therapy, hypnosis, various healing energy modalities, positive intentions/affirmations, metaphysical means like healing crystals, on and on. What did all this experience show me? That I'm screwed between the ears when it comes to managing my eating and my weight. Sure i could power through and have great results for a time (people would think I had surgery because of how different I looked) overtime, however I'd eventually go back to my compulsive eating behaviors. Finally, when I realized I was out of options and baffled I tried the last house on the block, a 12-step program for my compulsive eating problem. In the rooms i heard people share and I realized i wasn't alone in how I used food to feel better yet my mind and behavior with it was overtaking &amp; ruining my life. I was plagued with thoughts on what to eat, oh, no i can't eat that, ok, how do i avoid eating that because if I start I’ll eat too much, controlling ingredients…. then overeating and eventually compulsively eating. The big book of AA as adapted for my problem says I have a mind that is unmanageable. I can't “manage the decision” to stop compulsively eating for good and all. How did I know this? My experience proved it. I could have all the reasons to stop (serious health reasons, self-knowledge about myself &amp; exploring “why I eat” through therapy, self-knowledge of nutrition &amp; exercise strategies, job expectations to model good health, etc) was that enough to stop me for good and all - Nope! I got free from my constant obsessive thoughts around food, eating and weight by joining a 12-step program for compulsive eating. I got a sponsor and worked the steps. By doing that I am now free from compulsive food thoughts and the insane behaviors that would follow. Now, I get freedom from that barrage of food thoughts and weight obsession. Now i have a different way of dealing with life. Rather than turning to the food I turn to the steps, but i had to do the work and get through the steps to be able to start living life that way. I am a gratefully recovered compulsive eater and sponsor. I am happy to share more on my experience for those interested.",0.63,2,0,2,,2021-10-23T11:45:12Z,qe8gfi,t3

i just want to lose weight for this concert like a normal person. i dont want to be ""the big girl"" at this concert (like i am in my mind) but i want to lose weight in a healthy way. i just literally feel like i don't know how. i can't just lose a few pounds a week like a normal person on a diet, if i'm not starving myself i feel like i'm not doing it right. i don't know how to ""diet"" aside from just stopping eating. is there any way to stop this? after recovery, is there any way to diet like a normal person and not an anorexic person?",0.67,2,0,2,,2021-10-23T11:40:58Z,qe8ddc,t3
23,EatingDisorders,Request: I have two friends who have twitter accounts and they are enabling one another in their sh and ed's.,"I'm posting this on multiple related subreddits I'm sorry in advanced as I'm really bad at explaining stuff and I don't know how much detail to go in. TW: self-harm (sh), suicide, eating disorders (ed), abuse I have two friends who have twitter accounts (which they've given me the usernames of) and they are enabling one another in their sh and ed's. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do get, to a certain extent, why they want to and what they are doing (I used to sh and restrict very often, but I've been able to step away from the habits after a while- I won't pretend like I've been involved to the extent that they are though). They really don't care if they live and I don't want to make this into a ""woe me"" when I don't have to go through the struggles that they do, it is very very difficult watching them be hurt- hurting themselves and eachother. I want to help, and I'm trying to by just being there for them but I can't help but to feel so upset that all I can really do right now is watch as they slowly traumatise themselves or even slowly end their own lives. I don't know what to do at all. Maybe I'm some idealistic kid who think that there has to be a solution to everything, but I really do want there to be something I can do. One of them has a terrible home life and is in a poor financial situation so I'm hesitant to tell a teacher for that could complicate things for her or she might not even be able to afford help. I also worry that, even if that wasn't the case, she would leave 'help' going back to her habits again. Doing this might make it a 'sure fact' for her and prevent her from getting better in the future by herself. I do not know what to do at all. The school's known that she once would sh and once would restrict her eating, so she goes to therapy now, but it seems like it's done nothing. I asked another friend of ours who I believe to be really logical and level-headed and she told me that we can't do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm probably so selfish for saying this, but I genuinely don't know how I can watch them deteriorate. But I can't leave them by themselves either. What do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

(If anyone else is going down the same route and you're reading this I just want to advise staying off social media groups for sh and ed's, they romanticise the habits so much and have made my two friends very toxic without them even noticing.)",0.66,2,0,2,,2021-10-23T11:40:03Z,qe8cpj,t3
24,EatingDisorders,Request: not really sure,"I used to have some sort of eating disorder I’m sure, never diagnosed but I know I had to of since I would starve myself and all of that but I did pretty much get over it. Not perfect but I could eat and not care about gaining weight and stuff and I was okay for a few years.

&amp;#x200B;

But now something has triggered my brain and I can’t eat at all besides maybe a few chips. All I have eaten in the past week are some chips and two cups of Mac and cheese I could hardly keep down. I think it started to start in my last place, we developed a fly problem, maybe they are fruit flies, I still found ways to eat like I would eat in my car away from them and that worked.

&amp;#x200B;

Well I have them in this place also now, in this place they come and go. Not sure why bc we have tried to get rid of them but they are just always there. But I think they triggered me since they go after food. Now I think maybe I’m scared to eat. If I see somebody eating I gag and have even puked and even typing this I feel like gaging. I can hardly look at food now.

&amp;#x200B;

I really just want to be able to eat but I’m stuck on what to do about it. I already have had issues with food and I feel like it’s all going to come back much more.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s affecting the things that I want and need to do. I went to the fair a few days ago, it’s my tradition to go every year and it only comes around in October and I felt physically so bad going on the rides that I love, I kept getting dizzy and feeling like I was going to pass out. I still pushed through it and enjoyed myself enough but still I missed out on a few things cause I physically couldn’t do it and I have more stuff coming up that this might affect.

&amp;#x200B;

I even wanted to try this new food that came out at a pizza place but now I can’t cause I can’t eat.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I have to just try to wait it out and keep trying little by little as much as I can but it sucks when I legit just want to eat. I want to cry about it literally cause I like food now and I don’t want to feel this way physically again.

26,EatingDisorders,Request: I don't want to go into treatment because I'm terrified they'll make me restrict," 

I absolutely NEED to recover. I restrict on weekdays, then I b/p on the weekends. I'm constantly hungry, constantly thinking about food, completely obsessed with it. I'm underweight, always cold, have terrible insomnia. My tongue burns and I have near constant acid reflux due to purging. My teeth are discoloured and my skin is pale and breaks easily. I'm losing hair. I am not productive and cannot focus at work. I'm moody and irritable.

But I don't want to go into treatment. I'm already followed by therapists and dietitians and all they've done is make things worse.

I hate meal plans. They're so restrictive. They only foster my obsessive tendencies around food. I see the meal plans they usually have in treatment centers and I already feel anxious because it feels like such little food. I already restrict myself. Getting told to restrict by professionals that are supposedly there to help you recover would be heart breaking. I don't want to eat at set times. I don't want to ""learn portion control"" and ""appropriate portion sizes"" (as if I don't know that myself). I don't want to ""eat balanced meals"". I don't want to ""enforce a controlled structure"". I don't want to be surrounded by other sick people like me and exchange tips and tricks. I don't want people to give me meals that don't satisfy me and then get told that binging is bad if I ask for more. I don't want to have to choose between freaking ""exchanges"" for a snack or a meal. I don't want to eat a single fist of protein sources or whatever. I just want to actually stop having an eating disorder, stop caring about food, stop being hungry, and start eating whatever I want without restriction. But I also know that if I did that right now that would mean binging and binging and binging and that would in turn mean purging. And I don't want to purge anymore.

I also don't want to get into treatment and having to get scrutinized by a bunch of therapists who copy paste their education on me. No my ED is not about control. No I don't have trouble with my parents. No I don't feel fat. No I'm not doing this for attention. No I didn't have an unhealthy childhood. No I'm not using food to soothe my anxiety and numb unpleasant emotions. Yes I know that there is no good or bad food. Yes I know that two rice crackers is not a meal. I've been freaking screaming these things for ages and no one ever bothered to listen - I've been told that I'm in denial and that ""if I don't wanna change then no therapist will make you change"". Yes I do wanna change, I'm just scared to do so, and I'm looking for effective help and I don't feel a treatment center would be able to deliver that.

But I also no longer know the alternative. I used to think that having my own treatment team would be great but I've been repeatedly failed and now I'm worse than ever and I feel that I have no options left.",0.94,54,0,54,,2021-10-19T18:19:27Z,qbnll4,t3

28,EatingDisorders,Request: How to help myself and my mom with Anorexia," 

&amp;#x200B;

I am in my early 20s, just graduated college, and living with my parents. My mom has been underweight my entire life, as far as I know, and has never been diagnosed with anorexia for whatever reason. If you didn’t know her like I do, you might call her “healthy” and you might be jealous of how strictly she sticks to her diet. But if you do know her like I do, you are aware of her extreme disorder, a disorder that has also impacted me, her daughter.

I can recall my earliest memory of being insecure about my body - 4th grade. I don’t know if this came from other mean girls around me or if this was as a result of my mom always restricting my food intake and controlling my entire life, but from that moment on I was extremely aware of my appearance. My issues have followed me to this point, causing me to have a binge eating disorder throughout middle school, high school, and college, whilst starving myself to get rid of the weight I gained from binging. For about a year, while being able to cook for myself and having the freedom to do what I wanted, I reached a point where I stopped checking my weight and was able to eat without feeling guilty. I stopped binging for the most part and was doing well. I gained some weight over this summer and when I was preparing to come back to live with my parents (packing for my flight) and I had an extreme panic attack. I think it was the thought of my mom seeing me after having gained visible weight that terrified me, coupled with the thought of having gained weight. So I got home, and my mom would not stop staring at me, encouraging me to go to the gym, etc. Sorry, this is the longest story ever.

So to summarize my mom, she has been gluten intolerant for many years (gluten free) but now has come up with a million other food intolerances, thus, restricting her from eating anything with carbs, fat, or processing. This may sound like someone who is orthorexic, but believe me, it’s anorexia. Nearly 95% of our conversations involve her bringing up exercise or food. She often talks about how she lost “the weight” she gained in college, when she was 5’6 and on the lower end of normal!!! And this is the worst because she says that she was so fat then, and that is less than I weigh now at the same height. Yes, I’m aware everyone has different bodies, but imagine how it feels when your mom weighs less 3/4 of what you weigh, and you’re almost the same height.

I don’t know what to do because I feel like it’s been so long that she’s been starving herself, I don’t know how she doesn’t have any drastic health problems. If anyone knows, could you tell me what some potential health problems are in adult anorexics? (55+). I know I personally can’t help her, but I just don’t know why her doctors aren’t doing anything. I feel like due to HIPPA, etc. I am unable to speak with her doctors about her health, but I fear that she will die if someone doesn’t intervene.

If anyone has any general advice for me and my situation, I would love to hear it. ❤️

I (19F) have only recently discovered that I have a restrictive eating disorder. And ever since I realized this, I haven't been able to get it off my mind.

Everytime I eat or look in the mirror or any reflective surfaces, I want to lose weight and I feel guilty for eating even just a little bit.

And recently people around me have started making remarks about my body. Maybe they've done so before and I'm only noticing it now, but it's really triggering for me. But in a weird way.

I've been called thin or slim more often over the past few weeks than ever before. I want to be thin, so shouldn't I be happy to hear this?

My mind processes it like this: ""You're so thin, but don't you want to be thinner than this?"" I don't feel thin, so being called that feels like a lie to me.

I'm not sure if there's any way to avoid this though. And I don't even know if there's any remarks about my body that won't trigger me.

36,EatingDisorders,post: im getting worried about my eating habits and attitude about my body,"Hello,

This might be a bit long. I have struggled with eating issues since about age 10. I never had anorexia or bulimia, but was diagnosed with EDNOS at 14 (it was orthorexia, but that isnt a diagnosable ED). It sort of just went away over the years until recently.

At 19 i began taking psychiatric medications. I gained a lot of weight and just didnt care anymore. I became overweight. My mental health declined and i ate a ton, never excercised at all. After getting off the pills and on wellbutrin at 21, i started to lose it all very quickly. Ever since then, ive started having issues again. Id starve at work (i was working a very physical job in 90 degree heat) feel sick, almost passed out many times. This is when the weight all dropped.

Its never enough. I lost all the weight i gained and im still not happy with my body. Ive maintained the same range for a few months now. I refuse to eat over a certain amount or certain foods. A coworker bought us all lunch today and i got a burrito. It came with chips and a cookie. I ate the burrito, i was starving, felt terribly guilty about it, and hid the cookie and chips. Another coworker gave me a candy bar which i also hid. I ate too much during the day at work so i cant eat a proper dinner. I got a promotion and dont work a physical job anymore, so i have been putting on a few pounds. This scares the heck out of me and i feel gross. I try to cut back down on the eating so im only eating what im burning off without activity but when i fail i feel awful. Im even thinking of coming in at 3am to do the physical job, and go to my normal desk job from 7-5 just to keep the weight down and my arms toned.

I started taking a diet pill designed to make me feel full so i wont eat as much during the day. It makes my stomach hurt really bad. I dont want this to get worse, i dont want to gain weight but i dont want to be sick either. I cant afford therapy or any sort of help until my new insurance kicks in (i just moved out of state) probably in January. What can i do until then? Im trying so hard to eat healthier, to eat what my BMR is, but i feel terrible turning down other people's offers of food and cant eat out unless i plan all day for it. I hate feeling this way. I dont want to be the way i was again, at 14 or 19.

I should probably add, i just moved 6 hours away from my parents in with my boyfriend. My whole life changed. Im autistic so this is very hard on me. Should i ask my bf to hide the scale so i dont obsess over it?",0.83,4,0,4,,2021-10-16T09:13:27Z,q9ctft,t3
37,EatingDisorders,Request: The line between ED and healthy eating habits is blurring fast for me...," 

This afternoon, when eating lunch, I remembered that I was eating and it nearly made me sick.

It was just a piece of leftover chicken, nothing special, but biting into it I could feel the grease, the texture, the disgusting sensation of it being masticated in my mouth like I'm some fucking animal. And I looked down and felt a surge of nausea. I wanted to throw up at the sound of my chewing, the taste of the food.

This has been going on for nearly a year, now. A downhill battle, one that's hard to fight.

Because I want to gain muscle and look stronger, look like a guy rather than a round blob that I see in the mirror. And it's hard to grow muscle without protein, without food. Yet, I just...don't want to eat. I've started counting calories not just for the sake of avoiding overeating (which I have a tendency to do) but to also make sure I'm eating enough (which I also have a tendency to do).

Every day, it gets easier to convince myself that I shouldn't eat anything, that the cramping and the pain of no food is good, that it feels good. Because it does. And because if I don't eat, I'll get thinner, I'll look better. As far as support goes, family...doesn't get it. In fact, they encourage horrendous behavior due to an abusive hierarchy they're completely blind to. My mental health is deteriorating, so is my ability to keep on the right side of the line.

38,EatingDisorders,"Request: I think my friend has an eating disorder, what should/can I do?"," 

have a friend that I met at the start of freshman year of college, when she was pretty overweight. Over the course of that year, she lost a lot of weight through dieting and tons of cardio, and ended around the cusp of underweight. We’re in our senior year now, and she has gained a little bit of the weight back but is still very much at a healthy weight.

The thing is, the way she talks about food/eats makes me worried that she has an eating disorder. She typically only eats once a day- when we go out to eat, she doesn’t like going out too early because it means that she’ll be hungry for the rest of the day, and she doesn’t like going out too late because she’ll get too hungry beforehand. I know that it’s not just a habit of intermittent fasting because sometimes she’ll talk about how she’s hungry, but won’t let herself eat because she already ate enough for the day (as described by her, not me).

She also talks about having to “earn” her food; she often brings up how she can’t eat xyz unless she goes to the gym for a certain amount of time beforehand, or if she eats “too much” accidentally, she “makes up” for it by exercising more later.

I know that it’s not super serious since she’s not like skipping days of eating or purging food, but at the very least it feels like she has a pretty unhealthy relationship with food.

She definitely doesn’t think there’s any problem just based off the way she talks about eating- we’re all college students so our eating habits in general are erratic, but she talks about skipping a meal while hungry to avoid weight gain in the way that we talk about skipping a meal when we don’t have time to eat, which I don’t think is very comparable at all.

Anyway, I don’t know what I should do in this situation, or whether I should do anything at all. I’ve probed at it a little bit before but she got defensive so I didn’t continue. A bunch of us in the friend group have mental health issues like depression/anxiety , and we kinda split ourselves by “normal” and “mentally ill” (I’m in the latter if it matters), but she firmly considers herself as one of the “normals” and that she’s completely fine, so a therapist or psychologist is very much not an option in the near future.

I obviously can’t force her to go to one, so is there anything that I should be saying/doing, or should I just let her be since her physical health seems fine at least?",0.75,4,0,4,,2021-10-16T09:09:25Z,q9cquu,t3

41,EatingDisorders,Request: Making ED Recovery app with game elements and I need your help!," Hello There :) I am a computer science student and for my Master's I am making application for people recovering from Eating Disorders with game elements in it. However I need some help with thinking of ideas how this game should look like. Right now I know that this game will have tasks with different stages of difficulty (by doing easy one you will be able to do hard ones etc.), achievements, special prizes etc. The goal is to create beautiful forest with variety of trees (I want this app to be calming) - easy tasks with give you seeds and harder versions of the same task will water your trees so they will grow. I thought that asking you, people you could be using this app daily in the future, is a great idea! So, do you have some thoughts on this? Any examples of tasks that you think would be great and you would like to do (like eat 3 fear foods or drink some liquid calories)? Or maybe some ideas of what achievements would mean a lot to you, how they should be seen? I would be really thankful if you'd share some of your creative ideas and experience to help me make the best possible app for fighting eating disorder! &lt;3",0.98,66,0,66,,2021-10-16T09:05:27Z,q9coeo,t3

45,EatingDisorders,Request: Is This Normal? Burping up food after Refeeding since may.," 

Hello! So recently I have been experiencing some really weird effects  of eating and im not sure if its a new manifestations of anxiety (  which has been a lot higher lately) or an actually reaction to food.  Here is some quick context on my recovery. My ED was really only active for about a year, during which I was of  course dangerously underweight and lost my period for over a year. I  have been following a Refeeding plan since march which really kicked  into high gear only in august when I had to move back home for a kind of  ""stay at home as an inpatient"" type of treatment. Since then ive been  steadily gaining weight every week, and have been cleared to start doing  exercise! (yoga and walking. nothing too intense ). In the beginning of  my Refeeding process I ofc. experienced a lot of bloating, and burping  and gas. As is what expected from introducing your intestines to food  again and slowly building the proper microbiomes to help digest food.  It's since stopped and I feel less physically uncomfortable from the  food that ive been eating. My nutritionist says my stomach has just  about stretched back to a normal size.  So here lies the problem.... I feel so nauseous after I eat, every time I eat. Though nothing I have  been eating has changed. I have been following my meal plan exactly  (  still haven't introduced food challenges yet). I am able to have variety  with my foods while still staying constistent. but IM BURPING ALL THE  TIME TO THE POINT WHERE IM SPITTING UP MY FOOD LIKE A BABY. It's  terrible!!! I'm burping and my food is rising up my throat again I can  taste it!!! Is this normal???? I feel like this is a sign that I can  start  reducing the amount of food I am eating bescause I eat soooo  much. but im approaching being at a my set weight soooo. I feel like  this is sign of my body saying ""it's okay, your good. keep feeding me  but I don't need this much food anymore"". The real kicker is...... even  though I am literally nauseous and burping, I a m s t I l l  hu n g r y.  My therapist stays this might just mean that my anxiety about my food  is making me have a physical reaction that immitates hunger.... which  then gets me more anxious.... which then makes me think im more hungry.  its a vicious cycle. anyway. if anyone has had any experience REMOTELY CLOSE TO THIS PLEASE  HELP ME OR JUST SHARE WHAT YOUVE BEEN THROUGH FOR SOME SEMBLENCE OF  CLARITY!!!1",1,2,0,2,,2021-10-12T13:35:47Z,q6smvg,t3

Hey there! So, I'm proud to say I've been recovering  from restrictive eating for a little over a year now and am now unable  to restrict which, frustrating as it may be at this moment, is a win for  my body. However, I'm finding that even though I've followed all the  advice my dietician has given me, I'm still dealing with constant hunger  and very mixed up hunger signals. Before my ED, I was definitely an  emotional eater and still am, so it's hard to differentiate all that,  but basically I simply don't ever feel full unless I've eaten a very  very large amount of food, and even then, the feeling goes away quickly.  My dietician has increased my protein and vegetable intake to try to  counteract it but I just can't stop bingeing. They're not huge binges,  but enough to cause me a lot of distress. I binge about every day and  it's really making it hard not to fall back into old habits to  counteract my weight gain.

Basically, I'm looking for advice on how to deal with this if anyone has any",1,4,0,4,,2021-10-12T13:33:45Z,q6sl8e,t3
48,EatingDisorders,Request: help with binging," 

hello... im a 16 year old girl and i have recently  started recovery for my restrictive ed (early august). i am doing it  without outside help so i have given up a bunch of times and then kept  going and it hasnt been the most consistent journey but lately ive been  more dedicated to eating properly and i had been doing pretty well until  these past weeks. 

i have always struggled with binging in my disorder (mostly reactive  eating, and id always purge via fasting after it happened) but in  recovery it has gotten so much worse. i dont purge anymore, i told  myself id listen to my mental/extreme hunger and everything ive read  says you have to eat as much as you want when you're in recovery. i usually  dont tell myself ill restrict after eating ""too much"" or anything like  that. but when i try to listen to my ""mental hunger"" i always just end  up binging in secret, eating things i dont even want, eating past  satiety, eating very desperately even if i dont want to, even  hiding/stealing other peoples food etc etc 

im just really lost. i have no idea how to stop it, and i would  really appreciate some kind of help from anyone who has struggled with  binging? im wasting a TON of money on food because i just keep eating  and eating and eating and im doing horribly in school because i spend  the whole day binging and cooking instead of studying and i skip a ton  of classes because of the pain. and its not extreme hunger because i  dont do it out of hunger. when im too full i just chew and spit and i  cant make myself stop at all 

while restricting i had extreme hunger episodes and id binge on  fruit, vegetables etc and then purge and i knew it was directly caused  by restriction, but i have no idea what it is now? my binges are pretty  odd i think compared to what i usually see classified as binges and i  mean like sitting on the floor desperately eating 13kg of lettuce with  my hands ...... i dont restrict any specific foods either, and i always  binge on fruits and veggies and whole foods and honestly anything i can  find. i really think its some kind of food addiction (??) but i dont  understand because its not to sugar or whatever just. Food 

id really appreciate any kind of advice on how to start getting  better...? i try my best not to restrict or let myself purge after  binging but even though im still underweight and i havent gained any  visible weight yet for whatever reason this is all really making the  other side of my ed panic and im afraid ill relapse into restriction  soon",0.84,4,0,4,,2021-10-12T13:32:50Z,q6skk1,t3

50,EatingDisorders,Request: What is the role of a friend in helping a friend eat?," 

One of my good friends is dangerously underweight. He is seeing an osteopath and  physiotherapist to help him recover from the effects of a nasty bicycle  crash a few years ago, and both have told him there is no point  continuing the sessions unless he is able to put on some weight. 

I have had a number of conversations with him about it, and I don't  think he's in denial or has an overwhelmingly unhealthy psychological  relationship with food - it's more that after years of depression and  similar struggles he has neglected to care for himself and fallen into a  pattern of surviving off cans of red bull (4-6 a day at a guess) and  maybe one meal a day on a good day. As I say, I think this is more a  result of apathy than anything else.

My question is really around finding the balance between just being  his friend, and not trying to be his nurse or whatever - and actually  trying to help him. I really do believe if he were able to get some good  nutrition in and cut down on the energy drinks it could transform his  life, but I know he doesn't want me checking up on him etc.

Obviously one thing I can do is cook for him when I see him, and I do  that. But beyond that, what is the role of a friend in assisting him  with his struggle? I could text him a motivating message, or just ask  him if he's got calories in yet today, but as I say I don't want to be  his nurse. It is frustrating though when he complains about his  weakness, lack of energy, his back pain etc when it seems to me he isn't  acting in his own self interest.

Is this one of those 'cant help someone who won't help themself' scenarios? Or should I jostle and harry him along?

52,EatingDisorders,Request: I have an eating problem and I don’t know what to do," 

Ever since I can remember I’ve gone through cycles of starvation and binge eating and I have no idea what to do anymore.

When I was in middle school I was very heavy. My Sophomore year of high school i got into working out and by the time I was a freshman in college I was in the normal range, and I looked unhealthily skinny, and destroying my body working out didn’t help. I’d work out so much with eating less than xxx calories (low) a day that I’d just burn out after about 2 weeks of going insane with working out and then binge eat for a week or so, and this cycle repeated from 2018 to the pandemic.

During the pandemic I ate normally and worked out a bit less and got up to xxx (still in normal range) where I felt alright, but I was still binging when I wasn’t killing myself in the gym. This wasn’t sustainable once I went back to school and I ended gaining more. But I just can’t break this habit of starvation and binging.

This week at Muay Thai I almost fainted because of how little I ate the day of and before, and the past 3 days I’ve done absolutely nothing but eat garbage, and no matter what kind of meal and workout plans I make, mental “commitments” I promise myself, or anything along those lines I have not had a healthy relationship with food in my entire life.

I’m just in desperate need of help. I want to be able to eat a normal amount of food without being scared I’ll starve myself or binge, I want to be able to enjoy the physical activities I do without being in so much physical pain because I have no fuel for them, I want to be able to have a slice of pizza without creating the temptation to eat two pie’s by myself.

53,EatingDisorders,Request: My partners insistence on a healthy lifestyle is triggering my ED," 

Me and my partner met about a year ago and have been dating since then. One of the things that I liked about him at the start was his positive outlook on life and his dedication to having a healthy diet, he started this lifestyle a few years ago after his ex developed diabetes from a poor diet.

I’m almost two years in recovery from an ED that consumed my early twenties, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been since I started eating normally again and I’m now a healthy weight and reasonably fit.

I told my partner about my recovery pretty early on in our relationship and he was very supportive. He said we should get healthy and fit together and I agreed, so I would eat what he ate when I stayed over at weekends and we would go for long walks together.

I didn’t realize the extent of his diet until a couple of months into our relationship. He eats absolutely no sugar and only eats fruit occasionally ‘as a treat’, everything has to be organic (which is great!) or better yet grown by himself, no fast food or anything cooked in vegetable oil, the only carbs he eats is whole grain rice etc. He obsessively checks the ingredients of anything we buy in the supermarket. We usually eat the same thing every night, some kind of fish with vegetables and occasionally a tomato sauce.

All of that is great on paper but the problem is he makes me follow this diet as well and gets very upset if I don’t, I baked a homemade loaf of bread recently and he started an argument about how unhealthy I was being. I have a sweet tooth and because of my ADHD I need caffeine regularly to be able to function normally, I’ve been sneaking out and having a soda a couple of times a week but the anxiety of getting caught gets worse every time I do it. I feel so sluggish during the day and end up binge eating when I visit family which makes me feel terrible.

I’ve tried to talk to him about this multiple times but he just doesn’t listen, I’ve said that I can feel my old ED habits creeping back in but he brushes it off and tells me I need to ‘get a grip’. I know it’s important to have a healthy diet but I also think it’s okay to sometimes enjoy a sugary drink on a night out or a piece of birthday cake but I know for a fact he start at argument at best or leave me at worst, if he ever caught me doing either.

This relationship is the best I’ve ever had and the only one I’ve ever been able to see lasting long term, I know he only acts like this because he cares about me and worries that I’ll get sick like his ex but I feel like I need to put my mental health first. I’m not sure what to do next to be honest, I’ve been thinking that maybe couples therapy could help but I don’t think he would agree to that.

62,EatingDisorders,Request: How do I learn to love a body that has betrayed me?,"&amp;#x200B;

**Content Warning: Sexual Abuse**

I’ve struggled with disordered eating for perhaps 8 years — I only finally got help for my ED this year where I was diagnosed with atypical anorexia (and honestly i still don’t feel sick enough, because it’s “atypical” and it means i’m not normal because i’m an overweight, fat anorexic person).

&amp;#x200B;

In June this year, I was also sexually assaulted by someone and during it, raped multiple times for 2 hours. My body was hogtied, put on a collar and leash, cuffed, strangled into submission. My body was used and he said he wanted to send me to all of his friends to use my body as a cock sleeve too, like my body was an object and like I was a sex slave. My body’s trauma response was to freeze and fawn. It went against everything I wanted to do, which was to get away from him. He touched my body as he showered me. He forced my body to climax. He ejaculated inside of me without a condom and I had his semen in my anal cavity, and I still feel like remnants of him are stuck inside of me.

&amp;#x200B;

My relationship with my body, sexual assault-wise, was already really bad. But since it was brutalised by the assault, I simply cannot stand living in it anymore. I want to crawl out of my own body but I can’t. My dietitian tells me that I need to nourish my body properly, in order to heal my body and my eating disorder, but I can’t. I cannot love the body that was used, the body that he enjoyed, enough to want to feed it properly. I can’t bring myself to do it. Sometimes I just want to starve it so much that it gets so ill or ends up dead, just like how I feel inside.

&amp;#x200B;

How am I supposed to learn to love a body that has betrayed me, that has been tainted by him, that has been made a cock sleeve, that should no longer deserve love nor comfort? How do I learn to feed my body and overcome my eating disorder, when I’m constantly wishing that the body would just wilt away?

im the type of person who eats a  lot of things that are full of sugar and fat and all these. So i have  this problem: if you put food on the table i will eat until i literally  almost throw up. I will eat until i either cant eat at all or until  there isnt any food left. I think i dont control how much i eat, however  i dont feel guilt, shame or anything negative about it.

65,EatingDisorders,Request: My friend has an ED," 

My friend has an undiagnosed ED. What she described to me was pretty  complicated, but the point is that she doesn't eat for 5-6 days, only  drinks coffee, tea, milk and energy drinks, and then she binge eats for a  day, but she mostly eats sugar, honey, candies or chocolate. She has a  psychologist she can talk to but I don't see any progress

And I am not a psychologist nor a therapist, and I'm afraid to do  anything with this because I'm afraid I'll just make it worse, but at  the same time I can't just watch my friend ruin herself

One day she said ""guess what, yesterday I could hold myself back and I  didn't eat anything"" to me very proudly, and I didn't know what to say  to this so I answered ""okay"" and then she said ""this is not okay, this  will literally kill me"" while still smiling

Whenever I eat something I always ask her if she wants some, and she  always says no, and I don't force her to eat. But when I see her eating  too much sugar, I convince her to put it away, and I give her something  healthier, but I never force her to do it. Should I?

What should I do and shouldn't do? I'm really worried about her, but I don't know what to do...",0.87,27,0,27,,2021-10-08T17:02:42Z,q47xhm,t3
66,EatingDisorders,Request: Possible eating disorder?," 

So it might be that I have an ed, I’m not sure  though. A lot of the people that I’m around tell me that I’m not eating  enough. Sometimes that is true. I had a phase where I didn’t eat  anything for several days from circa december 2020 to february 2021, this  led to hair loss so my parents started to watch that I eat enough(  because of my hair). In the following three months, I started to eat  again because I got sick (not related to my eating ‘habits’). But then  as soon as I got healthy again, I have to force myself to eat, I’d still  like to loose weight, maybe that is a reason why I’m doing this again  since june, but I don’t know how to help myself before it gets worse  again. I’m already in therapy because of another mental disorder but I’m  scared to tell my therapist anything about the eating because I know  that she has to tell my parents and then I’ll be forced to eat. I know  that help is always good and I know it would be better if I told my  therapist but like I said I’m scared that I will involve other people  and mostly I’m scared to eat. So this was a long story and I don’t have a  diagnosed ed but maybe someone has a little bit of advice on what I  can/should do. thank you for reading :)",0.6,1,0,1,,2021-10-08T17:01:41Z,q47wr2,t3

i’m also a healthy weight, and am moderately athletic although i’m not working out right now. i do have okayish self confidence, i have a history of hating my body but it’s getting better after a residential visit. i’ve never had an eating disorder before technically but i did try to develop the habits, to which i don’t want to do so again because it’s unhealthy and i don’t want an eating disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

the problem is that i am losing weight. i’m still healthy, but physically i’m always exhausted, like dragging my feet, my hair is dull, my skin is dry, and i cannot concentrate for the life of me. i like snap in and out of what i’m doing. i also don’t want to eat more because the weight loss is kinda nice and i’m not hungry so it’s not appealing anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

idk. i’m not necessarily trying but idk sometimes it feels like i have an ed and sometimes i genuinely think i’m fine. i just really really really would be so upset if i did because that’s just another thing i would have to work on.

&amp;#x200B;

final note, my best friend has an eating disorder and i see the way she operates and i don’t support it or copy her whatsoever, because it’s clearly unhealthy and i don’t want to make myself miserable. if i want icecream i eat icecream. the end.

So she associates food with overweightness, she does not see it as a fuel for her body to function just as something that is just bad for her, so now she would starve herself for weeks, she had 2 kids which changed her body the way pregnancy changes it and she thinks she should not work on her body but just on her eating disorder because that is the problem, i agree she should accept herself first the way she is, but i think it would be easier for her if her physique was a bit better, please someone correct me if i am wrong. 

Now i think that losing weight will help her a lot with her body image and her eating disorder, diet is hard but still possible and she should start soon.

I go to her for something else but she knows about my messed up relationship with food so every session we spend at least a small amount of time talking about it (she insisted on it so if she does care)to check up on me and make sure it doesn’t get completely out of hand.

During our last session she asked me how it was going and at some point I asked her if she thinks I have an Ed, and she responded that she thinks that it seems that it’s still a hobby to me and that I just like spending time being busy with body image and calorie tracking and that an eating disorder becomes a disorder once you physically can’t do things anymore like going to a school etc and also that I didn’t look that unhealthy anyways and damn it really messed me up 💀.

Before she said that the amount of cals I consumed a day was already like toddler sized but now even that seems too much for me and I just don’t want to eat anymore and start hating the feeling of food in my body. I already think I might have some type of b/p ana bc i am underweight now but I still binge and I already feel invalid and gross for binging but her comment straight up made it worse and now I just feel like I have to prove to her that I can get skinnier and that I can look unhealthy and part of my wants to tell her that her comment messed me up but at the same time i am just so uncomfortable talking about my struggles around food I just never want to talk about it with her again.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother and her husband (not my bio dad) always made comments about gaining weight even though I’ve always been thin and athletic. I think they were maybe projecting, idk. Lots of “once on the lips, twice on the hips”, “weight gain in your face is hard to lose and your face is round enough” (my face is not round at all), and other comments about my stomach having fat rolls (again, I have always been athletic, so these did not exist).

I’m not really sure why it would be manifesting now that I’m in my early 20s; their comments usually went in one ear and out the other but now I can’t help but think that I look overweight.

I’m not super obsessed with counting calories or anything like that, but I do go one or two days at a time without eating on a regular basis and when I do eat, it’s usually something small like a bowl of cereal. I’m just worried I’ll put on weight, I guess.

Again, not sure why it’s only now becoming an issue, but both my doctor and my therapist agree that I need to see someone about this.

She wants me to find an ED specialist and schedule an appointment with them by next Wednesday. And I’m also supposed to meet with my doctor about healthy meal plans and diets at some point.

i have an eating disorder but its not anorexia, bulimia, or anything where im trying to lose weight or be skinny. ive seen 4 psychiatrists, 2 ER doctors, and 3 therapists in the last 6 years and none of them have any answers for my symptoms. ok so sometimes i cant eat food because im stressed or im just not hungry, and then when i start to get hungry, i feel like the timings ""not right"" and i have to wait and try again. And im not doing this on purpose or to try and lose weight, i cant control when this happens. so then im finally able to eat, and i take one bite and im completely full. and for the people saying ""you have to force yourself to eat"" i literally cant because ive tried that many times and i usually throw up, not on purpose. sometimes food is just completely overwhelming and i literally just dont want it to touch my tongue. i dont have the mental energy to mash up food with my mouth or swallow it, everything sounds gross and makes me depressed. (it also doesnt help that i live in america and the fda approves carcinogens in our food) so for example, i couldnt eat for  days because the timing wasn't right (literal time of the day and other variables that include stress, feeling of stomach, how hot or cold the environment is and type of food + the texture of the food) and then today i decided i had to eat an entire pizza to make up for the calories i lost from not eating, and that gives me stomach aches which cause more anxiety. and now i wont eat until probably tomorrow night because i have work in the morning and it stresses me out so bad i cant eat there its so gross nobody wears their mask in the break room.

ive been having this same problem for about 5 years now and i am currently almost 21 and weigh about xx pounds (very low).

the only things that make it kind of bearable are mirtazapine and smoking weed.

i havent had any trauma regarding food in the past my parents have always had good eating habits and kept the fridge stocked with healthy foods and i was allowed to eat whenever i wanted when i was growing up.

but yea i really want to gain weight im sick of looking like a teenager, sometimes i get so much anxiety about it that jts hard to eat and its a horrible cycle i get stuck in

88,EatingDisorders,"Request: I’ve been dealing with disordered eating and unhealthy thinking around my relationship with food since I was a preteen,"," 

Hi Reddit. I’m 16, and a guy. I’ve been dealing with disordered eating and unhealthy thinking around my relationship with food since I was a preteen, and I think it’s affecting me largely enough to reach the point of an eating disorder of some kind.

I’m not going to detail too much as that’s not really what this post is about, but I restrict, I think as a result of both being unhappy with the way I look and feeling out of control of other things around me. I feel guilty about not eating healthily or exercising as much as I should, but in trying to do so I have always just ended up making myself feel worse and doing it for the wrong reasons. I used to develop a lot of weird stomach issues and with the handful of medications I’ve cycled through quite a few have really messed with my appetite, including my ADHD medication which of course I take daily. I’ve tried to deal with it on my own but as my general mental health has been improving a lot (which I am so grateful for), my habits and thoughts around eating have not and I think it might be time for me to get help.

I’ve mentioned my eating somewhat in passing to my mom and my former therapist, but neither seemed to understand fully what I was getting at. One of the first things I talked to my therapist about was how I felt I did not think of food in a healthy way but it was kind of just left there, and I mentioned to my mom when she began to notice my eating habits getting worse again during the very first lockdown here in Canada how I sometimes eat less if it means feeling in control of something. That was basically where the conversation ended. I don’t blame either of them because I have a hard time accurately describing things and minimizing them when I do, and I didn’t quite talk about the extent of these thoughts and behaviours.

I’m afraid to ask anybody for help and talking properly about how bad it’s gotten in the past and how it affects me day-to-day, even on good days, because I feel a strong sense of shame surrounding this aspect of my mental health. People generally think of EDs as a ‘girl thing’ which logically I know is absolutely not true and in theory I know that there’s no shame in the struggle that I’m having, but when I think about telling somebody and having them look at me and KNOW that this is something that’s on my mind all the time, I just feel so mortified. The thought of telling my mom makes me feel ill, and I have a very strong relationship with my mom and tell her everything, she’s been my main support through every other struggle I’ve had with my mental health and she’s supportive and understanding beyond what I would have ever hoped. But I just can’t stomach the idea of telling her more about this than I already have. I’m scared of telling anybody. The only person who really knows is my best friend, who also struggles with it. He’s the only one I’ve ever really talked about things in detail with, but of course he can only do so much and generally we steer away from talking about it with each other to avoid triggering the other or something.

Even typing this and sharing with people who will never know my name or anything about me other than this, I feel terrible. I don’t even really know why. I guess by admitting that something is wrong in more than my own head means it’s more real and I’m not ready for things to turn upside down to make me better somehow, and also maybe I just don’t want things to not be okay. I don’t know. But I’m really not sure what to do. I don’t want to feel like this all the time and trying to fix it on my own hasn’t worked but I also don’t want to talk to people and have them see me the way I see myself, as weak or something. I don’t know. I’m also scared of what treatment might look like for me. The idea of meal plans or being monitored in any way or anything just makes me feel sick and the idea of eyes on my eating habits more than they already might be makes me feel so anxious. I feel like I’m not ready to get help yet but I’ve also been telling myself that for years and I really want to feel better and be able to eat without feeling guilty. Sorry for the long post, I just really don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to go or who to talk to, I considered talking to a teacher I trust but again I’m scared of how they might see me and I’m scared of burdening them with my issues or making them worry or something.

Thank you in advance for any and all help. I don’t entirely know what I’m looking for, because I don’t know if I will end up getting help any time soon. But anything and everything you can offer is appreciated. Thank you again",0.92,10,0,10,,2021-09-30T04:55:40Z,pygkau,t3
89,EatingDisorders,Request: I’m just curious if I should seek help with this,"I’m just curious if I should seek help with this, it’s been effecting how I am able to function daily for quite some time but I don’t know if this is a disorder. Basically, I hate food and everything about it. I hate chewing, I hate the smells, I hate the textures, it all makes me nauseous. My body gets hungry, really hungry, but the thought of eating is absolutely repulsive. My stomach can be growling but still, the thought of eating is so unpleasant. The only “food” I can really think about eating without getting nauseous is like Naked Juices and soup, but let’s be honest, it’s unrealistic to switch to “drinking meals” for the rest of my life so I’d like to relearn how to want to eat food. I haven’t always been like this, maybe the past 2 years or so. I remember I used to not mind chewing, I used to crave food. It’s starting to become a real issue because it takes me forever to get anything done because my life revolves around forcing myself to eat. I don’t not eat, I pretty much snack instead of eat meals because I can’t sit down and enjoy a meal. I can “handle” snacks because it’s only a couple bites I have to force down. When I force myself to eat (everyday) it’s so unpleasant. It sucks to force yourself to eat but I do it because I know I need to eat, I know I can’t skip meals and be healthy. I’m happy with my body and I force myself to eat because I like to stay active and you can’t really be active if you don’t eat. So, it’s not like I’ve convinced myself that I hate food because I’m afraid to gain weight, that’s not it at all. I seriously just can’t stand everything about eating from the textures to the smells which is making my life a lot more difficult than it needs to be.

90,EatingDisorders,Request: I might have an ED and it's very mentally exhausting,"I always grew up with normal weight, but since I got my period pretty late in life my metabolism began to change and it is now much easier for me to gain weight and it's taking a big mental toll on me. I am pretty sure my mother had an ED as she was underweight for years while also exercising excessively and undereating. I never thought that impacted me until recently when I realized how much I internalized her behaviour. Every little remark she had about my body, such as ""you already have enough weight on you so skipping dinner shouldn't be an issue to you"". Whenever I confronted her about it she would jump into defense mode saying that she isn't saying anything bad and that if I gained weight she would surely tell me... At this point it's been more than a year of constant mental pressure by counting every calorie I eat and feeling fat if I didn't exercise almost every day. I had to take a break from exercising and I felt like I was gaining weight all the time, while also being obsessed with weighing myself every single week.

I’m a teen in high school and around 3-4 years ago I ran into some issues with my weight. I thought that skipping meals would make people like me more since in middle school I was made fun of but not necessarily for my weight ever. I was very awkward and what most people would consider unattractive. So I began to drop weight like crazy and eventually my friends said they’d tell someone. Fast forward a year and I started to get into makeup, it started out very natural and light but it turned into a full face for school every single day. The guys and girls that made fun of me now paid extra attention to me. I was called beautiful by everyone even some of my siblings guy friends and soccer teammates. Problem is that I look disgusting without it and I have to wake up early every morning to put on this mask. And even after years my weight problem has never gone away, I throw out lunch at school to stay under a weight and I refuse breakfast. I get extreme guilt and panic when I go over a set number of cals. I cant tell my mom or an adult because my own mom even said I’m wearing too much makeup and asked what I’d do if these boys saw me without it. And when I tried opening up to her about my diet problem when it first started my phone was taken and that was that. Now I can go without social media I’m not like that but that’s how I’d talk to my friends who have my back. My mom cares but just don’t understand. I’m so obsessed with makeup and my weight and I know I’m unattractive without it. I don’t know what to do.",1,6,0,6,,2021-09-30T04:51:34Z,pygig6,t3
93,EatingDisorders,Request: GI issues and anorexia comorbidity- what should I do about surgery?," 

Hello all, I am a 20 year old with BPD and have restricted for three-ish years. In the first year, I lost \_\_ lbs in 7 months. Then, I kept up the restricting to maintain it and gradually lose even more weight.

A year ago in December, I had wisdom teeth surgery and was on a round of antibiotics. That’s when my GI issues started. I experienced reflux, ibs, bloating, chest pains, nausea, LPR (reflux which affects the vocal chords and upper body/nasal passages), and about a million other symptoms. Stomach pain, burning, belching, indigestion, you name it. We did a million tests. Put me on a million meds. Nothing worked, and my reflux score was through the roof. No SIBO, no H. Pylori, no ulcers, nothing. Except for a small hiatal hernia, that is. I qualified for surgery, and am supposed to get it in a month. However, about 6 months into this whole ordeal, I was diagnosed with gastroparesis, and just so happened to start recovery and gaining weight at this time. See the connection?

The GP was initially bad, and while I never threw up, I had bear constant nausea and stomach pains. Then, I followed a low fat, low fiber diet. Up until this point I had literally been limiting myself to one meal of bland chicken and rice a day, believing it to be healing as that’s what all the acid reflux groups told me to do (look up the Acid Watchers Diet- absolute anorexia fuel).

Eventually, my dad realized that I was using this diet as a way to fuel my ED.I was tired and in pain and sick of not eating what I wanted. The kicker was that the diet wasn’t even helping. So now I was miserable AND refluxing daily. So I said fuck it. I may as well eat what I want and deal with the consequences. So I did just that- I ate what I wanted. Chocolate, coffee, pizza, all the bad GERD foods. And it was bad for a bit, but then… it got better. And it just kept getting better the more my restrictions lifted. Every day I tried a new food that I hadn’t touched in years, whether it be due to the ED or low acid diet. And every day, I felt a little better. Now, I have gained \_\_ lbs and eat whatever I want. And I still have occasional nausea and sadly nightly reflux every night (my LES is shit, when I lay down it all comes up no matter what), but Jesus fucking Christ I feel so FREE and GOOD for the first time in forever. That’s great right?

Now my fear: I’m supposed to get a Nissen Fundiplication surgery and hiatal hernia repair in November. It’s supposed to get rid of my reflux for good. The drawbacks, however, are as follows; 3 months of a restricted liquid recovery diet, the inability to ever burp/vomit again, will be restricted against certain foods forever, a high chance that it will CAUSE GASTROPARESIS, a high fail rate after 5 years, and the inability to ever lift more than 50 lbs again.

Look, I know horror stories are everywhere and that I should just ignore them, but I can’t. I’m just stumped, I planned my life around the idea of getting this surgery in November. I postponed school for it. But my dad is terrified that it’s a big mistake, and that restricting will only make things worse again. He says that if I need to get the surgery later in life, to do it, but if my GI issues are manageable now and only getting better to not risk it.

&amp;#x200B;

I, myself haven't personally suffered any form of eating disorder so I find it really hard to understand how it impacts someone and their emotions and sense of self - so I'm desperately seeking help.

&amp;#x200B;

I met my partner during a time when she had relapsed and was very thin, the usual visible bones and really hollow face

&amp;#x200B;

Since being together I've been really trying to help her with her recovery and encourage her, cook her meals that actually taste amazing so she can find some joy in eating. This has all worked great and she's slowly put weight back on.

&amp;#x200B;

But now I'm worried because she keep referring to herself as gross and fat etc - when really she just looks like an average human now.

&amp;#x200B;

What are some things I can do or say to reassure her that she looks perfectly fine and normal? Are there anything I should avoid saying or do? Are there any behaviours I shouldn't play into?

Any help would massively be appreciated!

97,EatingDisorders,Request: Do I have an ED and what can I do to help myself?," 

This has been an issue for most of my life where I have zero portion control and put a lot more on my plate than I should and still feel hungry afterwards. I’d ask my stepmom if would be okay for me to eat something a few hours after eating dinner and usually she’d say no. My parents would have to make some of my food for me because I didn’t know when too much was too much. My stepmother also made a rule one day where I had to wait for someone to be in the kitchen in order to eat or be anywhere near the kitchen, but this rule never happened.

Me and my parents have argued many times about portion control and Ive gotten grounded before because of it. It’s gotten so bad that I’d steal snacks from other people (my stepmoms room as an example). An example being that one night I was still hungry after eating dinner so I grabbed a donut and took it up to my room, which I didnt think anything of at the time. But now I realize that that was a dumb decision because 1. The donuts are only for breakfast and 2. I took one when I didn’t even know if anyone else had any yet. My stepmom immediately knew that I had took them and this was the conversation:

Stepmom: I know you think you are slick coming down here and taking donuts while I’m in the bathroom! You are ridiculous! You felt the need to take the rest of what was in that box but one half!? You might as well have taken that one too! You don’t listen to anyone! You know you aren’t supposed to be doing that shit!

Me: I took one and I thought that one half was for someone else cause it was only one half.

Stepmom: You had more than one tonight. I don’t care that you want to have more than one donut, but you should have waited until tomorrow.

Stepmom: That’s too much in one night, you have to start having some self control. I hate that I have to hide everything because you can’t control yourself. Everything in moderation girl.

Stepmom: I love you and don’t want to see you have health issues like me. That’s why I get on you.

I don’t really know why I do this. I believe I do it because I’m bored and that food is the only thing that’s really enjoyable to me anymore. I’ve also had an unhealthy diet as a child so that probably makes it worse. But I know that I need to stop doing this, especially considering I’m overweight and barely do any exercise cause I’m afraid of people judging me.

For six+ months I’ve been doing so much better. Today, a friend of mine told me I look like someone (tiktok) famous, who just so happens to be plus size (makeup videos, their body is never even in shot). They’re a beautiful person, and their makeup is amazing, and all of the comments are telling her how beautiful she is, and she is beautiful. But how come after six + months of doing ok, it broke me? I haven’t felt this triggered in so long. I had my first meal at 2pm today after work (unplanned, but something me a year ago would’ve been proud of) and after receiving her message saying I looked like her, I suddenly felt disgustingly guilty about eating as I was about to take my last few bites. I didn’t take them, and now I’m scared about how long this fog will last.

I’ve never been that triggered about anything before during my improvement with food until now. It feels so scary, it feels like I want to hide and not eat and not wear anything nice or do my makeup or see anyone at all. It makes me think about what I was like a year ago, and my brain starts whispering that it’s a good idea, I deserve to go back there, it’s what I need.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now being followed by a nutritionist who gave me a weekly meal plan to follow: I went from eating very very little, tirelessly exercising, to following a balanced and satisfying meal plan, not really exercising besides some light walking (I was advised not to exercise heavily because we're trying to get my period back). My main problem right now, though, is: snacks.

&amp;#x200B;

I used not to have them before (not for lack of hunger, of course) but my nutritionist added them to the plan, and while the first few days went somewhat good (my body was a bit confused because my hunger signals are completely fucked up right now, and I didn't know whether I was hungry or not, whether I wanted more food or not, etc.), the past few ones have been odd.

&amp;#x200B;

After I eat my snack, I get this incredible energy crash where I feel completely low, irritable, sleepy and am unsure whether I am getting 'about to faint' signals from my body. It doesnt really happen after my meals though, so it must be something tied to the snacks.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know how normal this is, I mean I'm thinking it might have something to do with my metabolism suddenly getting all this energy that it was lacking before, and using it all up, but I don't know. My weight (in the low-healthy range) has been somewhat stable for now, it's a little bit less than what it was when I was last visited by my nutritionist, but less than half a lb. I'm trying to follow my meal plan as best as I can, although it's not always easy as you all know.

I had to attend an occupational health meeting for my new job a few months ago (I am a doctor myself) just to go through my medical history and my ED was brought up. I definitely got the impression that the doctor seeing me had a slight judgmental tone (if not a bit disapproving); although I’m used to it, as I’ve had bad experiences as a patient when doctors/health professionals find out I’m a doctor struggling with ED. She then asked about all my ED behaviours in detail, which I felt extremely uncomfortable talking about as she was a complete stranger and even with therapists it takes some time to open up. She weighed me as well, which I suffer a lot of anxiety from and have not done so in a long time. After all that, she kind of ‘lectured’ (?) me about how I need to maintain a ‘healthy’ weight and if I lost too much weight then they would have to remove me from my job and I couldn’t return to work until I’d recovered my weight, plus another few months on top of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I get where she was coming from. But ever since that meeting (I was cleared for work which was fine, there weren’t any concerns) I’ve felt it really triggered a lot of past behaviours and anxiety.

107,EatingDisorders,Request: I’ve reached my breaking point," 

Hello, I think today I’ve reached my breaking point/ break through of realizing where I am at and it’s been sudden and I am very confused. I want to schedule a check up with a doctor in the next week and be proactive, but I’m just so confused at the same time of how I got here.

I didn’t ever have a problem with my weight and I’ve never hated it, barely thought about it, but things happened so fast and it feels like I hadn’t even realized it. So that’s kinda why I’m confused if I have an ED.

I have been around an average weight most of my life. 2-3 years ago I was slightly overweight due to a medical condition which I gained that weight in 3 months, then lost the same amount of weight in three months due to medication (doctors told me it was water weight/ inflation from the medication). But even then, I never really put much thought into my weight or appearance.

After that year, I’ve maintained my average healthy weight until very recently and I don’t know why but it went unnoticed. The last time I weighed myself four months ago, I was exactly my healthy weight. Since the pandemic started I’ve just been wearing sweats, hoodies, not putting much effort because I just wanted to be comfortable because I am staying home. My family and friends I see on a daily had not made any comments on my appearance either, I’m guessing since they see me everyday, they don’t notice subtle changes.

But it was yesterday that I met up with friends I hadn’t seen in a year. And the first thing, and the only thing they brought up was “you lost so much weight, your cheekbones are so prominent, you look like a model with that jawline” and questions along those lines.

And that is when I became self conscious, confused, all of the emotions basically. I didn’t have a problem with being an average weight for my height. And now it’s just making me reflect on my body more. My diet has remained the same, in fact I am eating more than I had before, I am exercising way less too. So I’m just in a confused state.

Today, I finally weighed myself. I am very underweight. I haven’t been this weight since I was in elementary school ten years ago. I took my hoodie and sweats off and looked at myself in the mirror. I put my hands around my waist and my fingertips are a few inches from touching each other. I broke down.

I want to be proactive health wise because I know this weight can be dangerous so I am scheduling an appointment because I haven’t changed any sleep, food, or exercise habits, and my mood was happier than ever so I do have underlying health concerns.

But I am here on this subreddit because psychologically, I am just confused, panicked, I don’t know what to do because I don’t know how I got here in such little time. Is this an ED, do I have BD? I know I need to get medical help but will they also provide me with therapeutic help? Has anyone else ever been through this? I don’t know, I have so many questions and no one to really talk about it at the moment because the people I see everyday haven’t noticed change, and the people I haven’t seen in a year, are trying to romanticize it even though I think it’s not good.",0.75,2,0,2,,2021-09-27T15:43:45Z,pwq4rm,t3
108,EatingDisorders,Request: Exercising after recovering from anorexia,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I had anorexia from age 10-15 and have slowly been recovering. I've been able to have 3 meals a day (sometimes more) and enjoy eating for about a year now, with a few periods of restriction. I never really used to exercise excessively, and after I became anaemic I stopped any form of exercise. A few years ago I tried exercising and it resulted in me counting calories and losing weight. Last year I tried again, when I was experiencing some bad body issues, and I would just cry every time I exercised because my intention was to make my body look ""better"". Whenever I lose a bit of weight I get very self conscious, because I feel I look as ""bad"" as I did when I had an ED, even though you can barely see a difference.

I'm satisfied with my body and weight now, I don't really look at my body and I rarely check my weight which is good progress for me. I would like to be a bit stronger and feel healthier. I have some form of heart condition (waiting for a diagnosis). I'm not particularly fit and I get tired very easily as well. I know exercise won't fix my heart condition but I think it would help me to feel better physically.

112,EatingDisorders,Request: Fake hunger,"Hi!

&amp;#x200B;

I am in ED recovery, used to suffer from binging and purging. I have learned about how my body expresses its needs to me and how to recognize true versus fake hunger (true hunger being the physical feeling of hunger; fake hunger being a craving for a specific food, for example chocolate, unaccompanied by an actual feeling of physical hunger). I was wondering how people deal with this fake hunger, since I recognize that succumbing to it will not satisfy the fake hunger and will make me physically uncomfortable since I will be way too full. What are some ways people find helpful in dealing with these thoughts?

She and I have been friends since we were like 10.

She wasn't coughing earlier today, and I'm concerned that what I actually heard was her forcing herself to vomit. It is also possible that she was just coughing a lot and also had to go to the bathroom, it happens sometimes. Maybe she drank some water wrong, idk.

I finally reached a healthy weight about two years ago after struggling with anorexia for over a decade.

I've taken this medication before for sleep and it absolutely raised my appetite and I gained weight quickly. When I think about how that could happen again I can't stop myself from hysterically crying and panicking over the thought of gaining weight. I know I should be more concerned with treating my depression but I really don't think my depression can get any better if I'm in constant fear of gaining weight. I want to call my doctor's office tomorrow and ask for a different medication but what if he says no? I can't take this again I have a bad feeling that I will start starving myself again. I am really scared, like I feel actual fear and I feel so hopeless.

I've tried four other antidepressants, 3 of which gave me zero effects whatsoever and the last one I took (Wellbutrin) gave me horrible side effects. A lot of anger and nausea and compulsions to hurt myself. I'm open to trying something else but it can't be mirtazapine. Idk the point of this post, I guess I'm just looking for some support.

121,EatingDisorders,Request: Am I relapsing or am I just poor?," 

So, between the ages of 15-19ish I struggled with an undiagnosed restrictive eating disorder. As far as physical symptoms go, it never got that severe, but it was extremely mentally taxing, as it consumed a majority of my daily thoughts. Eventually, the obsession with it subsided as I got more determined to recover for the sake of my future family.

Fast forward to several years later, and I'm living off of my savings in college, besides a small income from a part-time minimum wage job. I had all these plans for what I wanted to cook and eat for myself in college so I could eat healthier (meaning, actually eating fruits and veggies on a daily basis and skipping the ramen). But sticker shock quickly set in; combine that with anxiety about my financial future, laziness from depression and schoolwork, and I've headed the opposite direction. I find myself avoiding buying food under any circumstance. I avoid going to the grocery store, I avoid going out to eat, I feel good every time I skip a meal because I think of the money I'm saving.

However, I haven't started eating more, despite having less reason not to. My parents are kind enough that they're now giving me $20 a week for food. I find myself feeling unreasonably guilty about eating my boyfriend's food. And besides, I'm rarely in the mood to eat, especially if I'm really hungry. Occasionally, I just feel a general fear of eating food.

But it's not like I'm afraid of getting fat, like before. I rather wish I were more muscular and curvier. Although I will admit that, deep down, very specific things like seeing a bigger number on a scale, or pants feeling tighter trigger me.

Is this an eating disorder? If you have any coping strategies or directions I can pursue out of this, that would be great. Also, I have a therapist already, but I can't seem to find the opportunity to bring this up with her.",1,12,0,12,,2021-09-22T04:18:26Z,pt3pdl,t3

Q: I know that there are many different forms of ED and not everyone fits a label, but does what I described count as an Ed?

Q: Should I tell him about me as well? No one knows about my issues with eating, I have just been dealing with it on my own, I’m worried that if I tell him about mine it will be too much for him.

124,EatingDisorders,Request: Recently I haven't been eating all that much," 

Hello,

Recently I haven't been eating all that much. I've definitely lost weight, and although that is a good thing as I am overweight, I don't think its happening in a healthy way. You see, I recently started my second year at college. Last year I had similar eating issues, as I had found going to the cafeteria to be exhausting and a drag on my day, so eventually I kinda just stopped going unless I absolutely had to eat something. This year its kind of the same, except I'm eating even less and I've developed this anxiety, almost like a sense of dread, that comes on when I think about having a full meal. Even when I do challenge that anxiety and go to the caf to get some food (since I know I need to eat), I find it difficult to actually get a solid amount of food down. Every single time there's always something left on my plate, and although I want to eat it, I simply can't. Today, I couldn't even finish one piece of lasagna. It tasted fine, but getting it down made me feel like I was going to throw up.

I feel like this lack of eating is leading to brain fog and a general feeling of low energy, and I don't know what to do about it. I want to eat more, but my body isn't agreeing. I also have this weird feeling in my stomach that happens when I'm hungry but it feels so odd that if anything it makes me not want to put anything in my stomach over fear I might chuck it all up. I don't really know what to do anymore and I'm starting to get really worried about this. Its stressing me out a lot. Has anyone else here had symptoms like this? Do you know what to do about it?

Also as a sidenote I am bipolar type two and have been in therapy for many years, am on medication to control mania and depression aswell as insomnia, and I smoke weed daily, usually to relax and go to sleep.

Hi,

 My mother has struggled with disorder eating for as long as I can remember. As for myself, I have been struggling with maintaining a healthy weight due to anxiety and OCD for the past 2 years.

I have been noticing she stares at my body when I talk to her lately. It makes me very uncomfortable. To the point that I deliberately cover up in really baggy clothes if I’m going to be interacting with her. I’ve brought it up with her, but she denies she does it. However, the last time I said something along the lines of “please stop looking at my body” she said that I had a “beautiful body”.

For parents who struggle with disordered eating, is this something that’s normal?

I’m trying to be supportive during her recovery and be there for her, but it really makes me uncomfortable and makes me not want to see her in person.

He tells me I’m perfect but still I’ve started monitoring my weight and started a diet because the things he says he hates about himself are on my body not his.

Additionally his self hatred making complimenting him or telling him I love him impossible. He will respond “how could you love this fat piece of shit?” So ive started saying it less.

132,EatingDisorders,Request: Eating Concern/Confusion,"For starters, I was diagnosed with ADHD and GAD. I don't know if that info will be of benefit in knowing but my confusion around eating hasn't really been in the forefront of my mind. Until the other day. I had a breakdown because the store didn't have my white castle cheeseburgers. Looking back now, my appetite is and always has been weird/wanky. The white castle burgers is what I've been eating for the last couple of months, nearly everyday w/ my cup of cereal for lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

I do this with different foods all the time. I eat a specific food until I absolutely can't anymore. When the food that I am hungry for is not available, I break down. I can't just get in the pantry and easily grab/make something else. My brain simply doesn't work that way for.

&amp;#x200B;

Side Note: It may seem weird but I really don't consider myself to be a picky eater per se on what foods I actually like. I love just about every veggie out there and every meat source. I don't eat raw foods i.e. sushi. Besides that my variety seems endless.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this last food ""episode"" made me conscious that this is Not the first time I had a breakdown over food like this. The amount of mental work it takes to figure out what my body will accept to eat is quite concerning. I try so hard to work my appetite up, and sometimes to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

More often than not, thinking of certain foods make me feel gaggy and nauseous and I'd rather not eat at all. I push something down anyway in those instances because I know my body needs nourishment.

&amp;#x200B;

I do struggle w/ self esteem issues and C-PTSD but not really anything to do with my weight though. When I eat THC, I could eat anything under the sun. It ramps up my appetite and sometimes a little too much blood sugar wise (I'm also diabetic and have other health issues than what's been previously listed above) I don't want to depend on getting it in order to be able to eat. It's pricey and I can't really afford it nor want to be high all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Side Note: I don't and never have binged/purged. I have No want to. I'm not on a specific hardcore diet. I don't do calorie deficits or any type of fasting trends. I rarely ever drink a diet soda/caffeine. I don't eat out often. Stick to water or milk. I don't have an unhealthy relationship w/ candy-sweets.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just looking for support and if anyone has a similar experience with this whole eating sitch.

Perhaps it has something to do w/ ADHD or perhaps it's own entity?

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend has a cousin who came to study in the same city as us last year. He comes to visit very often and is currently staying with us for some weeks. My boyfriends family always referred to him as thin, but he is severely underweight and sickly looking. I mean i was taken aback the first time i saw him, i thought he might have some kind of health issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway i started suspecting he might have an ED when i noticed how much he would say he is eating. Like in any random conversation with him he would say that a day before he ate this and that (lists about xxx kcal worth of food - a large amount). Without me asking or without the topic being about food. Are random lies about food consumption a symptom of an ED?

&amp;#x200B;

Every time he comes to visit he is always about to faint and is physically very weak (as in he struggles to hold even his bags). When i ask him if he has eaten anything and to make dinner, he will reply that on that specific day he was very busy and then will proceed to mention how much he had eaten the other days.

&amp;#x200B;

And now since he is staying with us i noticed that when we sit down to eat he will have at least one glass of water before eating, 2-3 during food and one after. And then he goes to the bathroom afterwards. I might be imagining things, but i thought he might be throwing up.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if i should even bring this up, it's probably none of my business, should i say anything to him or even what i should say. I have no clue how to approach this. Even if he doesn't have an ED, being as skinny as he is and not eating until the point a person feels nauseous isn't healthy.

135,EatingDisorders,Request: Recovered for years; Losing weight &amp; unable to eat normally,"I dealt with bulimia and anorexia for eight years and ultimately recovered two years ago (I’ve been doing great except for the occasional triggers). A year and a half ago, I decided to cut out fast food from my diet just to be healthier, which has been amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the blue, about a year ago, my weight started fluctuating more than usual. I figured it was maybe due to cutting out the fast food and didn’t pay it much mind until 6 months ago when it was dropping pretty rapidly. At this time, I was trying to put on muscle, so this was frustrating for me. For my entire life, I’ve never really eaten much (I look back on my childhood and see a lot of disordered eating habits that I never noticed that fueled my ED later in life), but at the time I was trying to put on muscle, I was eating normal, regularly scheduled meals.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw my doctor and got blood work done which came back perfect. I genuinely thought I was going to see thyroid issues or SOMETHING.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for the last few months I’ve been having trouble eating. Barely anything interests me or makes me hungry and I feel sick whenever I eat or look at food. I’m going to go back in to my doctor, but this has made me wonder if it has anything to do with recovering from an eating disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

139,EatingDisorders,Request: I don't know if I have an ed or not?,"I've done all the research and spoken to many people but I still haven't found something that relates to what I'm going through, I don't know if I have an eating disorder but I do know that what I'm like with food isn't healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had history of having a funny relationship with food and I feel it's all catching up with me now.

&amp;#x200B;

As a child I used to eat a lot of food and never gain the weight from it, on my dads side they'd tease me for how much I ate and would offer me more food when I'd finish and sort of... let other families know I was a big eater. On my mums side my mum would worry I would get diabetes and my sisters would call me fat for what I'd eat even though I wasn't physically, even my friends at school would give me names such as ""fatass"" because of how I'd eat! as i got older my appetite died down a lot, to the point I could only manage 1 meal a day but there wasn't really any extra thought to it, I just couldn't manage to eat more than that.

&amp;#x200B;

However people started to notice I was losing weight and I started to notice too, my mum asked if I was starving myself and at that time I wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

The sudden weight loss was a worry at first, I thought it was a sign of cancer or something? but after receiving a lot of compliments on my figure and how slim I was I started to enjoy it and kept up with measuring and weighing myself.

&amp;#x200B;

It came to a point where I was almost underweight, I become almost obsessive over how I looked and how much I weighed and I still am, however through covid things seemed to decline and I started using food as a sort of... punishment? I wouldn't eat all day if I hadn't done something ""worthy"" of it, now what makes me question if this is an eating disorder or not is because I'd also restrict myself on when I could go to the toilet, if I was ""worthy"" enough to go.

&amp;#x200B;

But as time goes on I'm still obsessed with how I look and my weight, I'm about to buy scales and I've made a goal for myself to actually hit that underweight mark, I almost brag to people that I'm almost there? I know it's not great and I'm the only one proud of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel guilt when I do eat heavy things like an actual meal, I can't even remember my last proper meal? I have a tenancy to binge on junk foods and sugary snacks at nighttime too when everyone is asleep, I still feel guilty and hate myself for it in the morning. But there are times where I can eat fine through the day and not feel guilty, times where I go out my way to eat? but I always come back to the restrictive eating.

&amp;#x200B;

Today just for example all I ate was a few yogurts and I felt really proud of myself for it, I felt hunger pains and felt accomplished by it?

&amp;#x200B;

To summarise, I've made a goal to become underweight, I feel immense guilt when I eat but sometimes I'm okay with eating, I use food as a threat to myself (if I feel like a failure I will starve myself), I binge at night when no one can see me eating junk.

3 months ago my mom got sick and hasn’t been able to do much so i have been fending for myself. before school started i would usually eat a small snack like half a bag of doritos or maybe a muffin for the entire day. i could never find an appetite. when school started i’d eat breakfast (just a biscuit) and lunch which was a sandwich. when i get home i don’t eat.

this gets to my point. am i just lazy or is this the beginning of an eating disorder? i hate cooking but i dont hate eating. if someone bought me mcdonald’s when i got home id rightfully eat it up, or if my mom cooked me dinner i would eat that. but i never have enough motivation or energy to cook or really do anything. i spend 7 hours of my day on no food everyday. i feel myself being hungry and i know that’s not healthy but i really have no energy to cook.",0.83,4,0,4,,2021-09-16T20:28:01Z,ppqj1m,t3

146,EatingDisorders,Request: Could I possibly have an ED?," 

First of all, I want to apologize if I unintentionally trivialize anyone’s experience or display any ignorance/insensitivity for eating disorders or someone’s specific circumstances. A firm trigger warning for starvation, major weight loss and weight gain, medication abuse, and a pretty in-depth description of what’s going on in my mind.

This is the first time I’m ever talking about any of this, like, ever, since I bury it in a deep and shameful part of my conscience, so I apologize if this is a bit of a vent. When I was in middle school (I am now a uni student), I was overweight. It wasn’t significant and I never had a problem with it — in fact, I never even noticed it. However, I was living with my very abusive mother who essentially bribed me to lose weight (I won’t get into specifics but by ‘lose weight’ I don’t mean a healthy amount). With a combination of her encouragement and mental abuse, I lost… a lot of weight really fast. I went from being a bit overweight to quite underweight. This was mostly all from just not eating. I honestly don’t remember it — it’s a blur, but even though I was never weight-conscious before this, I felt quite good afterwards. I never thought anything of it despite a few concerned comments from those who knew me.

I maintained my middle school weight for a while, occasionally gaining some and losing some, but generally staying in the same range. Over a year ago, shortly after the initial quarantine, I gained all of that weight back and then some without even really noticing. But there was one day I suddenly became aware of the feeling of my thighs rubbing against each other… and this completely set me off. I have not stopped thinking about it since. It has consumed me.

Now I am obsessed with weight. It is always on my mind no matter what I’m doing. I can’t stop comparing myself to everyone — I’ll compare myself to any random person on the street without being able to control my thoughts. I compare myself to my boyfriend and he’s significantly taller than me and a male, but I still do it. I can’t stop looking at photos of other people and old photos of myself. I can’t wear more than half of my clothes because they don’t fit in a very particular way. I don’t seem to have the restraint I did in middle school regarding food and I’ve been stuck in a miserable cycle of eating, despising myself for it and promising to stop, then caving in and eating again. I can’t stop obsessing over how appalling I feel in my own body and it’s made me extremely, extremely depressed and has become my number one preoccupation. This past year and a half has sent me into a downward spiral and after not losing weight due to my constant relapsing, I’ve started to abuse my ADHD medication.

I guess my question, as pathetic as it seems, is: could this be an eating disorder or am I just insecure? I understand not to seek actual medical advice on here but am extremely reluctant to approach a doctor with these problems as I can hardly write them down, let alone say them out loud. What do I do? Is this insecurity or something else?",0.84,4,0,4,,2021-09-15T05:26:03Z,poneok,t3
147,EatingDisorders,Request: I am trying to control when I get hungry. Is this a problem?," 

For context, I am 19F living with my mum, with 2 older sisters, a younger brother and a younger sister. My mum does the grocery shopping, although me and my older sisters do pay some rent, and the four of us take turns making dinner.

On a couple of nights in a row, I found myself not particularly hungry during dinner and about halfway into my food I would feel full and slightly sick. I was sad because these were meals that I really enjoyed and made me feel really guilty about wasting my food. I started to avoid eating during the day so that I would be hungry for dinner and not waste the meal someone made for me.

At the same time, I also started feeling very depressed due to COVID lockdowns in my area and found a lot of my favourite snacks didn't taste good anymore so I eat a lot less than I did a couple of months ago. I never really eating a proper breakfast or lunch either but that is more about laziness over not wanting to prepare something for myself.

Do I have a problem? I always assumed that eating disorders were rooted more in body image or self-esteem so I don't know if what I'm experiencing should warrant concern.

I'll start by repeating that I cannot afford to see a doctor until I  have insurance (10/26). I am currently supporting myself and my fiancee  (disabled, absolutely cannot work) on $15/hr working full time at a  well-known big box store.

MtF transgender (technically fluid but further info here is  irrelevant), 4.5 consecutive years on HRT. weight fluctuates all over  the place, up or down around a third of my body weight in a matter of 3  months feels almost normal to me, lately. For the last month or slightly  longer, I've had an issue that has progressively worsened. I seem to be  unable to eat anything and keep the entire meal down. Maybe the first  two or three bites are fine, but even a sandwich is too much for me most  of the time. I don't feel particularly stressed, but I do feel like I'm  kind of fat, despite being largely a healthy weight for my frame, and  only looking overweight in my belly area. The thought of stepping on a  scale and seeing that I have lost weight, even a half pound, makes me  feel elated. I tell people I am fat when they mention food or clothing,  and they look at me like ""girl you crazy."" wanna weigh a number that I  know isn't a healthy number for myself.

I'm frankly, afraid to put food in myself and force it down only for  it to come up about 45 minutes later. I'd like to check into a rehab  clinic but I don't have the money nor the credit to do so, and I'll have  insurance in \~45 days. can't decide if I need to check in sooner or not.

Is there a good likely hood that I have developed any particular  disorder? I'd mention that we're also in semi-transitional housing  (renting out an air bnb for a reasonable sum, looking to move into our  own apartment soon) so it could just be stress.",0.57,1,0,1,,2021-09-12T18:46:55Z,pn3xqy,t3
157,EatingDisorders,Request: Does this count as an eating disorder ?," 

Does it count as an eating disorder if I eat quite a  lot during my normal periods and then undereat when I have anxiety,  possibly depression (or just sadness, hopelesness)?

I willingly lost quite a lot of weight last summer-autumn and went  from higher overweight to lower healthy, but since then i've been  maintaining my weight in a quite unusual (or maybe common idk) way,  which I don't do on purpose. I overeat when i am feeling  relaxed/happy/usual, and then I undereat when i am stressed. I may even  skip several meals when I am especially anxious or just depressed. I do  have body image issues but almost never is my stress caused by me  wanting to lose or control my weight. Before losing weight, i often  dealt with my stress and emptiness by overeating, which is why i  probably was overweight. Now, it's the opposite, it's like even eating  average amounts of food seems repulsive and makes me nauseous  immediately. My weight does fluctuate slightly, but it remains  relatively unchanged.",0.87,12,0,12,,2021-09-12T18:45:41Z,pn3x09,t3

I've struggled with food for a while. I was a chubby  kid, and I used to always wish I could just stop eating. I'd tell myself  I wouldn't eat, or I'd only eat one meal a day, but it never became a  consistent thing. There was a period of time a few months ago where I  was broke, I couldn't afford any food, so I stopped eating often. I'd go  a day or two at a time without eating, because I had to make what I had  last. During that time I lost a lot of weight, and people noticed.  Things have gotten better, and I have a wonderful boyfriend who cooks me  delicious dinners that I will eat, but most days that's it. I won't eat  anything else except for maybe a granola bar. Part of it is executive  dysfunction, but I can't deny that a part of me is afraid of gaining the  weight back, and that I don't deserve to eat. And I had the thought  today, that I don't have an eating disorder, I'm just choosing not to  eat.

160,EatingDisorders,Request: how to start a recovery," 

I have read a lot about EDs trying to see what is  happening to me and I would come to a conclusion that in the past 3  years I suffered from bulimia, orthorexia, body dysmorphia, anorexia and  overeating. The main reason I developed it is because I started with a  strict gym regime where I lost a lot of weight. I tried to stay on that  weight (which now looking back was too low) and that’s where the problem  was. Also, my perception of food was (and still is) totally distorted.  It was then when I started purging the meals that I didn’t perceive as  “clean”. Later that developed into a full blown overeating and purging  period and I gained all the lost weight back plus more. I felt miserable  with myself for years. 

Recently, I lost the weight again in a very unhealthy way by mostly  starving myself, overtraining and purging. For the past month I’ve been  overeating most of the days, since I guess my body was starving and I  gained some of the weight back, as well as the feeling of misery. When I  do this, I buy all the “bad” food that I can find, come home and stuff  myself with it until I fall asleep or can’t breathe anymore. Then I fall  asleep and purge when I wake up. I rarely eat a proper healthy meal,  but I always tell myself that I will. Then I decide not to eat for a  whole day as a restriction and at one point I start starving and I buy  unhealthy food again. And that’s the circle I am in… 

My main problem is that I noticed how this is starting to seriously  effect other fields of my life. I am often depressed but right now  mostly numb to everything, I can’t remember when was the last time I was  happy and laughing, I avoid social events, I don’t eat with other  people, I get foggy brain and I feel cold when I starve myself, I can’t  sleep if I completely don’t stuff myself and my perception of myself is  based solely on how I look and with that also my mood. I only feel  satisfied with my body when I look like a undeveloped girl and it  bothers me when my breast start to show.  I really don’t want to go through those “miserable years” again and I  want to start with my recovery. I have been trying to figure out this by  myself, since seeking professional help is too expensive for me. I  haven’t told my parents or my friends, but they’ve noticed that I have  phases, either underweight or overweight, also I think this is a very  sensitive topic so nobody directly asked me anything and I always made  some kind of excuses for my unusual eating patterns. 

I just want to be happy and normal again and I would appreciate any kind of advice I can get. Thanks.",0.8,3,0,3,,2021-09-12T18:42:01Z,pn3ut6,t3

Hi, I’ve been struggling with an eating disorder for the past twenty  years (yikes), but I have felt I’ve had a pretty good grip on my  recovery.

I’ve noticed one thing in particular that triggers me that I can’t  find info about is whenever I find out about someone who has experienced  addiction, I immediately want to open up to them but don’t, and instead  go into a tailspin of ideas and old habits.

Does this happen to anyone else? Does opening up to them help? I’m  wondering if this is a better approach for me. So many people don’t see  the connection between an eating disorder and, say, alcoholism, and I  would love not to get triggered by someone’s recovery journey even if  it’s not an eating disorder.

164,EatingDisorders,Request: I'm watching my best friend destroy himself!,"&amp;#x200B;

My friend of 5+ years who I've known since I was 15 is really worrying me. I'll need to give some context because this is a long story, but I can't just sit and watch what's going on anymore.

He is 25 and about 6'0"" tall. He is very skinny, it is very noticeable when he wears tighter clothing like jeans. Sometimes when he's bad, I can see his skeleton on his chest and his face - his eyes get dark around the sockets and he complains of fatigue and bad moods (could also be job related, he is a hard worker, but runs on fumes and energy drinks to get him through the week).

We've lived together with a few other friends of ours in a house we rent for the past 3 years. I tried to put the idea forward of buying our groceries together weekly and that we could take it in turns cooking a meal every night for each other,  like a family.

Nobody fancied this idea and we just cook for ourselves and occasionally if I make too much I will split my meal in half for one of the other lads. Sometimes I make extra for my friend because he has no food to eat.

This is where the problem is, he doesn't cook at all and never buys proper quantities of food to eat. I don't think I have seen him prepare a proper meal even 10 times in the past 3 years we've been here. He lives on instant noodles, beans and bacon, with toast clumped in butter. Energy drinks and cigarettes. Amd his favourite, takeout Pizza.

Now for the serious part. Just a few months we were in the kitchen and I was cooking me and him dinner, when mid conversation his eyes rolled into the back of his head and he collapsed in front of me. Luckily I caught him and his head before he could hit the floor. After he woke up, he was totally out of it and had no idea of what had just happened. I urged him many a time to go get checked by his GP,  but he hasn't done anything!

On top of this, due to him only spending his wage on expensive takeout pizza/burgers, daily energy drinks, noodles, tobacco and sugary snacks, he is coming short and having to borrow money from me to buy food, but it's all going straight on takeout again.

I'm no nutrition expert but this diet is a recipe for disaster. Not only does he never eat vegetables or fruit, but he doesn't get enough protein or calories to sustain the body of a 25 year old man.

He says every time he will do a proper food shop but he never does, and later that night or the next day it'll be more takeout again... I feel like I'm helping my best friend commit suicide!

How can I help him? Not only is he physically being ruined by this, but mentally he appears to be deteriorating too.

I don't know who to speak to about this because I don't want to seem like I'm obsessing over his life choices, but after knowing the guy for so long and seeing him in clear decline, I think I would be a horrible friend to not try and help him.

I don't think he even knows he has some kind of eating disorder, he seems to just think its normal when it's not.

Please let me know your thoughts and share any advise you have, I want to try and make an effort with him because we look after each other here, but he can't even look after himself and it make me so sad.",0.93,25,0,25,,2021-09-10T04:47:09Z,plhuol,t3

167,EatingDisorders,Request: Cycling through eating disorders,"I have struggled with eating since my mid teens, I am 22 (m) now. I’ve struggled with multiple eating disorders: anorexia, orthorexia, BED. For the greater part of my ED history, I have had the most difficulty with anorexia. At the moment I find myself cycling through all of them: very low cal diet as long as I can while exercising &gt; eventual failure persisted by binge eating leading to intense workouts from post binge guilt. Repeat. Throughout the years, it has never become a severe physical health risk, but I’m quite sure it contributed to the permanent digestive issues that I now have and am medicated for. On the other hand, it has been a never ending torment to my mental health. Within the past 2 years, it has consumed most of my day to day life.

&amp;#x200B;

There have been times where I’ve managed to maintain a healthy eating regimen, but it never lasts. Funnily enough, I feel the most in control when successfully maintaining an eating disorder; it evokes a rewarding feeling. The days in which I’m unsuccessful in my ED ambitions, I feel worthless and shameful. I’m constantly keeping track of certain dates to gauge how I should eat in the following weeks, or, pushing back/cancelling plans if I’m not yet satisfied with my self imposed eating boot camp, if you will.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m just really tired of it all. I’m tired of constantly postponing my happiness to some undetermined date that keeps moving further and further away until my body looks a certain way. My stomach sinks every time I realize my youth is passing me by while I wallow in self loathing. Most of all, I feel deep sadness at my inability to self love.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m aware that I use eating disorders to ‘bandaid’ a bigger issue of self perception, and that I would benefit from reaching out to a professional of sorts (which I’m looking into).

168,EatingDisorders,Request: need help seeking treatment," 

I've been in recovery for six years, but relapsed a few months ago. I've never been diagnosed or treated even though I had some pretty significant health impacts. I had three young children at the time, and was embarrassed of my eating disorder so I never sought help. I've managed pretty well until now. I honestly did not think I would ever be engaging in ED behaviors again, but after losing my mom last year, relationship issues, and my youngest having some pretty significant ongoing medical issues I started using it as a coping mechanism and it snowballed from there.

Every single part of me just wants this to quietly go away. The logical part of my brain is screaming at me. I'm in my 30's now, my oldest is 13 not 7, I feel like I've lost every reasonable part of me. I did this before on my own, but I'm really struggling right now. I don't think I want to give up my way of coping, but I recognize the damage I'm doing.

Anyways, we're back to the embarrassment/shame. I live in a small community, I have insurance but no primary physician because I've never been able to make an appointment for a checkup. I don't have a support network outside of the wonderful support system of therapists/teachers for my kiddos.

I've been trying to pick up the phone for three weeks to call someone. I don't even know who to call. And I'm so afraid of being judged. I could really use some resources, and encouragement to use them.",1,6,0,6,,2021-09-09T06:41:02Z,pkw4i0,t3

First of all sorry if what I'm about to say trivializes your real struggles in any way, I don't want to compare my experience to an actual disorder but I'm afraid I may be at the beginning of *something*

First of all, I'm a 29 year-old woman. I don't think any woman in our society has a completely healthy and happy relationship with food and her body but I don't think mine has been especially bad up to this point. I do have bouts of depression related to childhood trauma, and whenever an episode is about to come up I tend to be more uneasy in and critical of my body. I had one of those bouts of depression this summer and really lacked appetite for 2 months. I got better for a short while, started eating again and felt a little bad about getting back to the healthy weight I had been at previously.

Now I'm feeling myself slip into a bad place again, but it's a lot more body and food-focused than it's ever been. I somehow know that my brain is trying to distract me from the trauma and anxiety by dumping all of its attention on calories and the way my thighs look, but I also can't stop thinking about it. This morning I almost panicked in my kitchen at the thought of having some oatmeal. I've never had such a violet reaction at the thought of eating and I'm really worried.

I'm thinking of starting therapy and working through all of this with a professional but I'd like some advice, reassurance, first-hand experience, anything really that you may deem helpful.

170,EatingDisorders,Request: wondering if I have an eating disorder,"Recently, I have been wondering if I have an eating disorder. Since  March, I lost a lot of weight without noticing, which started a spiral of working out and eating “right”.

&amp;#x200B;

I eat an average of xxx calories (very low) a day in one meal. Oftentimes much less, and a lot of times what I am taking in is from drinks, not food. I won’t touch soda or dessert at all, and I will obsessively monitor how many calories are in my food so I can decide how much of it I want to eat. Part of it is I’m only hungry for a little, but part of it is deliberate. I have panic attacks when I see how many calories are in restaurant dishes. I often order a small house salad and pick around the cheese and croutons and dress it in lemon juice and pepper or nothing at all. I absolutely will not eat if someone else is not, to the point of starving myself because my partner is not hungry, or whomever I’ve gone out to dinner with just wants to grab drinks.

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost even more weight, but it is considered overweight BMI apparently, so no doctor will believe that I have an eating disorder. I tried detailing how quickly I lost so much weight and my relationship with food, but since I’m overweight and actively dieting, doctors just keep telling me that’s the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I don’t have a problem- maybe it’s all fine. Most of the people in my life brush off my concerns because “everyone feels that way when they’re dieting”. But I don’t think they do. And if they do, I don’t know why anyone would do it. I spend all day obsessing about what and how much I ate and punishing myself if I miss my workout (I hurt my knee really badly pushing myself to keep running after injured it, for one.) I’m miserable most of the time, but I can’t bring myself to eat. Even if I’m hungry.

It was there that I was actually diagnosed with anorexia- I've denied (and continue to deny) that anything is wrong when literally everyone, myself included knows that, that most definitely isn't the case. After finally being discharged I was kinda forced into recovery... I know I sound ungrateful, I truly am so lucky to have so much support and love, but in all honesty I wish it would just stop. I hate the attention that it's brought to me, I hate that people are almost babying me now. It's like everyone around me is walking on eggshells, being EXTRA nice to the point that it's just ANNOYING. I feel like crap for SO MANY REASONS. Because I was hospitalized I automatically got a place in an ED service in my city, a place that is generally really difficult to get into. I appreciate my dietician and psychologist so, so much BUT- I'm taking a spot from someone who might actually want to recover, someone who isn't just going because that's what has to happen after a hospitalization. As horrible as it sounds (it is) I do not want to recover and I feel so guilty for even thinking this way.

179,EatingDisorders,Request : I think I gave myself an eating disorder and I have no idea what to do with myself.,"Hello, since covid-19 ""2 week"" quarentine started, I made a vow to myself to lose weight and go from obese to normal in my bmi. I lost a lot of weight but I tried to get back into my routine (with moderation) . And I just can't.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel terrified of eating more than one meal a day now, I can't even force myself to go for seconds, I don't know why. I freak out thinking that I'm overeating, and then I just have nothing for a few days. Calorie counting is fucking dreadful, I can't eat something without figuring out my calories now. My birthday was yesterday, and I remember my entire meal of the day was 3 chicken nuggets and a small kale salad. And yet I didn't even finish that. I bought myself cake, ate it and just got upset reading what was in it. Thinking I'm gonna gain weight again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fucking terrified right now, and anxiety isn't helping me anymore, I keep thinking I'm being judged, I panic so much at grocery stores trying to buy something, and I just end up losing idea of where I am. I honestly can't take this anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go to my college counselor about this, but I cannot right now pay for anything to help. My families in debt from a medical bill from last year for detox I went under. I dont know what to do.",0.81,9,0,9,,2021-09-07T04:51:01Z,pjjwus,t3

182,EatingDisorders,Request: Feeling competitive (and alone)... in recovery," 

I'm recovering without a support system, it's a little scary. I keep getting a little jealous that some of my close friends are still restricting and all that. This feeling translates to annoyance whenever I see something about them fasting, restricting, etc. I don't take it out on them, but still. I know recovery is the best choice for me in the long run. But it's so hard to do this alone and it makes me sad that I'm the only one feeling this way among my friends. I don't know how to handle these emotions in a healthy way. Any advice? Also, I don't want to ask my disordered friends for support. It could trigger me. It could also cause them to make fun of me bc anorexia is competitive and Im technically not competition anymore. What should I do? I feel really alone",0.96,25,0,25,,2021-09-07T04:46:29Z,pjjv0j,t3

185,EatingDisorders,Request: How to cope with weighing my dog,"CW anorexia

&amp;#x200B;

I(F22) just started using a scale to weigh my dog because the vet wants her to come down a few pounds. The way I weigh her is by stepping on the scale and then holding her and stepping on, then subtracting to find her weight.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought after years of recovery this would be okay for me...and I felt really good the first day I stepped on and weighed less than the day before. But now I'm terrified of putting the weight back on. I'm having a hard time eating again, and I'm not sure what to do...

&amp;#x200B;

Usually I'd just quit weighing myself, but my pup is too big to put on the scale by herself. Does anyone know any other ways to cope?",1,21,0,21,,2021-09-07T04:43:36Z,pjjtt9,t3
186,EatingDisorders,Request; Moved to a new country and struggling," 

I just moved to Korea where I'm gonna be living and working for 1 year+. I'd say I'm pretty much recovered these days but at the moment I'm finding it very difficult to eat properly/enough. In quarantine I lost a small amount of weight but I really can't afford to lose weight.

At home in the UK I was vegan - not for disordered reasons! There is loads of great vegan stuff available in the UK and I enjoyed eating all kinds of vegan junk food. But here in Korea everybody loves meat and fish, kbbq, fried chicken, bulgogi, etc. Even being vegetarian is barely a thing. Realistically don't think I can be fully vegan here cause there's so few options and I'm fairly picky, but the thought of breaking my ""moral code"" (sorry not trying to sound preachy just can't think of a better way to put it) upsets me. I've been vegan for 5 years, before that vegetarian for 3 so now I feel intensely guilty if I eat something non-vegan.

Also I'm finding it tough cause I'm living on my own for the first time in a few years and now that what I eat is totally up to me I find it quite overwhelming. Sometimes I end up skipping meals or only eating a snack because I just don't know what to have, or don't want to keep eating the same stuff over and over.

Anyway I'm not actively trying to restrict or anything just worried about slipping back into disordered habits. My being here is completely tied to my job so I really don't want to get sick and be forced to go back home. Sorry this was kind of rambly. I don't really know what I want from this, I guess just to vent but if anyone can empathise or has any suggestions I'd be so grateful. Thank you",1,7,0,7,,2021-09-05T10:34:14Z,pif89e,t3
187,EatingDisorders,"Request: I have never not been underweight, but none of my doctors have ever expressed concern"," 

This is partly a response to a conversation I had with my roommate, who is plus-sized, and who expressed her frustration with the fact that she has never been able to directly address health concerns with a doctor without the doctor interrupting her concerns to discuss her weight.

Which struck me as odd, because I have been underweight for as long as I can remember, and yet no doctor has ever expressed concerns about it. And I'm not just slightly underweight either--I've always had a wide margin between me and what's considered ""normal"", to the extent that I worry about it.

I had a therapist who expressed concerns about my thought patterns regarding my weight. I've had friends who have repeatedly tried to hold interventions about my weight. But I always have to tell them: I'm not intentionally trying to lose weight, I just can't gain it.

I'm always, always cold. I swear sweaters in August. I passed out so frequently in college that I was famous for it. But even when I've gone to a doctor's and I swooned in the doctor's office and I hit the floor, in front of the nurse, the doctor still did not consider my underweight-ness a problem.

A large reason, I think, that my doctors have never brought up my weight is that I live with IBS, so I'm constantly sick and I don't have much of an appetite, digesting food can be painful, and my body doesn't absorb nutrients very well in the first place. So, whenever my weight comes up, doctors either praise me (which is probably not okay), give me the standard ""wish I had that problem"", or say that it's no problem because I'll gain weight ""eventually"". Some people just go, ""oh, get pregnant, that'll fix it"".

I feel like being underweight is one of those things that could be a risk factor for pregnancy complications so I think perhaps doctors should not recommend I do that.

My mother says I can't help it because I'm exactly like her. I inherited her intestinal distress, but my mom never eats. Never. I remember very few times in my childhood that my mother ate more than once a day. She would only ever prepare food if my father was home. And then she wouldn't eat it.

I work really hard to make myself eat. I buy foods that are easy to prepare, that are supposed to be healthy and make my intestines work. But it's still difficult to make myself interested in eating. I might go all day without bothering.

Sometimes, I'm told that my lack of interest in eating is just my depression and that the stomach upset is just my anxiety (it's definitely related). Also, whenever I express a concern about my weight, I am immediately asked about my sexual orientation. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive, because I do understand that LGBTQ+ communities are disproportionately affected by EDs, but my warning flags always go up when doctors seem a little too interested in my sexual orientation.

I've been told that being underweight is very unhealthy but I can't find much information about it. The second I search for it online, all I get are diet tips. Not helpful! The opposite of helpful! I also can't find anything about being underweight that isn't tied to eating disorders. Do they always go together?

Is it really that bad to be underweight if my weight is more or less stable? It won't change, no matter what I do. Am I stuck like this?",0.93,34,0,34,,2021-09-05T10:32:56Z,pif7et,t3
188,EatingDisorders,Request: What do I do if I feel my friend may be suffering with an ED?," 

My friend doesn’t have a good relationship with food. She doesn’t eat often and it worries me. She recently lost a lot of weight in quite a short amount of time because of this. She says she just forgets to eat but we live together and I remind her to eat but she won’t, she just says she’s not hungry. She always calls herself “fat” even though she’s not and still does even after losing so much. I’m very worried. I have spoken to her about her issues regarding food but she says it’s not like that. I’m not sure. Is there anything I can do to help her? We both study psychology and are interested in clinical psychology, I recovered from an ED so I know what it looks like and I just don’t know what to do.

189,EatingDisorders,"Request: Drinking laxative tea has messed up my stomach, and now I’m afraid to eat."," 

TW: Laxative abuse.

I’m a 37-year-old woman who has been “recovered” from bulimia for about 20 years. I say “recovered” because while I’ve stopped the daily purging, I still occasionally fall back on ED behaviors. I’m fully aware of this and won’t lie to myself.

About 2 weeks ago, I was constipated. Stimulant laxatives are a MAJOR no-no for me. Even with my sporadic disordered eating, I will not touch them.

I stupidly convinced myself that a diet tea was a better alternative. “It’s made from plant extracts,” I told myself. How bad could it be?

Really bad. Really really bad. I drank too much - like I fucking should have known I would - and now my digestive system is wrecked.

It’s been a week since I last had the tea and my stomach is still hyper sensitive. Eating anything other than binding foods sends me running to the bathroom within an hour of my meal. I can’t eat while I’m working. I can’t eat before bed.

I’m worried that this is going to send me back into the cycle of restrictive eating. I feel so fucking stupid.",0.98,63,0,63,,2021-09-05T10:30:48Z,pif616,t3

196,EatingDisorders,Request: How do I help my fiancé with her temper tantrums during meals?," 

My fiancé has been in recovery for a few months now, and while it had been going really well, the past few weeks have been dreadful during meals. A couple of weeks ago, we went to the doctor together, and she came out in tears because her weight was higher than she’s ever seen it. She said it was my fault because of all the meals I make us, and she accused me of trying to make her fat. Ever since, she has been declining all meals, and reacting incredibly negatively to my prodding.

I’ve had an eating disorder myself, so I’ve always tried to be gentle but insistent with her when she doesn’t want to eat, but that’s becoming much harder to do. Tonight, when I gave her a bowl of Mac and cheese for dinner, her response was to bury her face in the hot bowl and sob out something about me wanting her to be a pig. It was terrifying to see her like that, Beyond tonight, I’ve made many meals where she angrily throws it in the trash only few minutes removed from her begging me to make it for her. She also cries during almost every meal and sometimes even collapses to the floor in hysterics. It’s really hard on me because at her core, I know she wants to get better. When she throws away food, she trues to dig it out and eat it, and her outbursts are always followed by some form of “I’m sorry. I don’t know why I don’t get better for us.” My heart is breaking. I love her so much and don’t want her to be so despondent about recovery. Is there anything I can do to manage her temper tantrums?",0.85,25,0,25,,2021-09-02T07:20:16Z,pggr3z,t3

i'm 21 now, in the midst of a brutal relapse; i am getting help for the first time in my life — likely residential. i relapsed primarily because i have unpacked intense trauma in the last few months, which sent me spiraling and wanting control.

&amp;#x200B;

but i'm feeling so intensely conflicted. my ED voice is still extremely stuck in how it was when i was 14: degrading, obsessed with food and behaviors, consuming my whole day, feeling proud when i lose weight, and having a goal weight.

but, my 21 year old voice WANTS to recover so badly. i worked so hard to love my body and be healthy, and i have a ton of reasons to recover. i'm also a trans woman, so having feminine features means a lot to me — i want my boobs and curves back that i worked so hard for.

i feel so fucking hopeless. when i was 14, i didn't care about how sick i was getting. now at 21, it's almost more painful to see the things i worked so hard towards crumble apart; it feels like i'm on the outside just watching my body and mind deteriorate without control.

does anyone have advice on how to approach recovery? i've never gotten professional help before.... so this scares me so so much. and because i can't seem to get better EVEN when i so desperately want to, i feel so utterly hopeless in recovering. i'm scared of residential, scared of my ED voice, and scared that i won't be able to recover.",1,10,0,10,,2021-09-01T04:32:31Z,pfqdin,t3

However, recently I've had an increasing number of incidents where I will be eating and enjoying a plate of food, when suddenly it will become absolutely nauseating to me and I'm unable to force myself to keep eating.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't seem to be related to being full because it happens when I'm nearly finished, halfway done, or just a few forkfuls in indiscriminately. I also don't think it's allergy related because it has happened with all sorts of foods with different ingredients and spices.

&amp;#x200B;

I mentioned this to a friend bc it happened once while I was with her, and she suggested that it kind of sounded like an eating disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

I (24F) have been recovering from an eating disorder for the past 5 years. My flatmate (25F) and I have been living together for the past year in a very strict lockdown and it was really wonderful, we would cook and eat together at least twice a day and the food was always delicious and nutritious. Recently she has returned from a summer abroad with her family who are obsessed with looks and superficial things like that. Now that we’re living together again she is absolutely dead set on losing weight and keeps avoiding cooking together because all she wants to eat are vegetables. She wants to meal prep the same thing in advance because it stops her eating too much. She’s also skipping loads of meals, this morning she bragged to me about not eating dinner and skipping breakfast when we were having lunch together. She also is always complaining about how her clothes don’t fit her anymore because she is losing weight. Not only am I worried about her but I am also worried about myself. Being around her is very triggering to me. I don’t really know what to do. She’s a wonderful person and aside from this I really like her and get on with her. I don’t know what to do about it or how to tell her her behavior is triggering for me. it’s really difficult with all the comments about losing weight and just watching her restrict her diet. I don’t want to come off controlling or domineering but I don’t know how much longer I can last without asking her to stop doing this. She knows that I have a history with disordered eating. If anyone has been in a similar situation I’d really appreciate some advice or guidance.",0.88,12,0,12,,2021-09-01T04:28:35Z,pfqbom,t3
206,EatingDisorders,Request: Insomnia after beginning weight gain process,"Hi, I've struggled with eating issues for more than a year and recently decided to start gain weight with the help of therapists. I've been eating lots of pastries and sweets to gain weight. It's impossible for me gain by eating more regular food since I get sickeningly full if I try to do that. (Tbh I've been somewhat binging lately, but that's a topic for another day.)

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, I've always had trouble sleeping, although not to the point of insomnia. Ever since I started to eat more, I find it impossible to sleep at night. I have a fitness watch that tells me how much I sleep. Yesterday, I was really tired while lying on my bed but just could not fall asleep! I tried listening to sleep music. Whenever I successfully lower my heartrate, my heart starts beating really fast again. I also find that my mind is always running. I keep thinking about the bakery I like, how I pushed my friends away by dieting, and how I feel really alone in my dessert cravings (nobody seems to struggle with this). When I checked my watch: I got 1/4 the deep sleep I usually get.

&amp;#x200B;

Could this be a result from hormonal imbalance? When I tried to google insomnia after weight gain I get results for obesity. (I'm still on the lower side of a healthy BMI.) If this has any implications: I'm 16, female.

209,EatingDisorders,Program for female-identified adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 years-old and their caregivers in Oregon," 

Hello all,

Raising awareness about eating disorders, body image concerns, and how to promote body acceptance is a difficult yet necessary topic of discussion. The majority of adolescent females struggle with insecurities related to their bodies and often do not have a supportive environment that reinforces acceptance and self-compassion; when compounded with societal beauty ideals, many girls are at an increased risk for unsafe eating behaviors and further distress surrounding their appearance. 

In hopes to combat and reduce body image concern, the Family Body Project (FBP) was developed. The FBP is an experimental body acceptance and eating disorder prevention program in Oregon delivered virtually in English and Spanish for female-identified adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 years-old and their caregivers. If you are considering participating, you will receive an initial 15-minute phone call to screen for eligibility. If you are eligible, we will schedule an hour-long assessment that examines body image concern. 

As this is an intervention study, eligible families will either be assigned to the control group or the intervention group. Participating families will be compensated for their time with gift cards, totaling $95 over the course of the study. Teen families living anywhere in Oregon are able to participate, so please share this if you believe you know a family, or families, to whom this may be of interest! 

Potential participants can email Dr. Deanna Linville at [linville@uoregon.edu](mailto:linville@uoregon.edu), or leave a confidential voicemail at her office number: 541-346-0921. Potential Spanish-speaking participants should contact Celeste at [cmenamor@uoregon.edu](mailto:cmenamor@uoregon.edu).",0.86,15,0,15,,2021-08-30T04:49:36Z,peevwm,t3

I’m not sure if I should track calories and make sure that I am reaching my daily goal (I tend to convince myself I’ve eaten more than I have when I don’t track) or not track because the process of tracking just makes even more of my thoughts/time focused on food.

I don’t really know what’s going on with me. i have, for a very long time, have just been unable to eat. being near, smelling, even looking at food makes my stomach turn. i CAN eat, but it usually ends in discomfort and in the worst case, vomiting in the end. i’ve been to doctors who specialize in stomach issues and i’ve had tests done and there’s just nothing wrong with my stomach that the three different doctors i’ve gone to could find. but the pain is immense. what makes it all the more confusing for me is the fact that i have absolutely no body issues. i love my body. i treat my body the best i can. however, not being able to eat has taken a toll on my body. i have breathing problems and get winded very easily which started when the inability to eat began to get worse in 2019. i eat less than a meal a day right now and i feel sick very often. i get very cold to the point where i uncontrollably shiver and i sleep with a heating pad and typically in full winter pajamas and socks. even then, i find myself waking up freezing and sick. no liver, kidney, or gull blatter issues, they even put a little camera down into my stomach and found nothing! i don’t know if this really classifies as an eating disorder, but i do strongly believe my lack of food is a causing factor in the other problems. i can’t just “force myself to eat” because when i do, i typically end up losing the food that i’ve gained. i’ve even talked to my psychiatrist and therapist about it, as well as the staff in the psychiatric ward. this was when the additional problems were really coming into affect, and they said that they didn’t believe it was an eating disorder because it was unwilling and not forced. i just need advice to make my life easier. i’m in constant pain and can barely lift over 30 pounds anymore. i have a hard time working and sometimes even driving because of the pain. i’m lost and scared.",1,1,0,1,,2021-08-29T17:45:14Z,pe5ka5,t3

216,EatingDisorders,Request: How can I 'stop restricting' without starting binging?," 

I've long been suffering from a restrictive ED. I've been told by multiple professionals and resources that the only way for me to recover from my ED is first and foremost to 'stop restricting'. However, no one ever explained to me what that means in practice.

Because to me, right now, 'stop restricting' means just binging. There is NO amount, type or combination of food that ever satisfies me to the fullest extent. I always want to eat more. So anything other than ""eat forever"" is actually restriction.

I'm being followed by a therapist AND a dietitian but both of them no longer really know what to do with me because I'm never getting better and if anything I'm regressing. That's because on one hand the dietitian prescribed me a meal plan which, however balanced and carefully crafted it is, still feels like restriction to me - I have to eat 'normal portions' at certain times etc. - and on the other hand the therapist's been doing mental work with me that has been incredibly helpful to let me understand so many things about me and my personality and has made me progress so much in several aspects of my life, but has changed absolutely NOTHING about my ED behaviours.

Basically I follow this supposedly balanced, abundant and adequate meal plan for a while, maybe I gain some weight, but the meals never satisfy me and it feels like I'm restricting all the time, waiting for the next meal to come, always obsessing about food etc., so at some point I ditch the meal plan because if I have to restrict then I wanna do it on my own terms. So then after a while I just get fed up and I'm so ravenous that I actually do decide to 'stop restricting', so then I end up eating all the time and binge on thousands of calories, which then I promptly purge because I cannot stand the weight gain....blah blah blah, it's a very known common cycle.

I feel so lost and don't know what to do. I feel like I'll have to restrict my whole life because I cannot fathom ever being satisfied by a 'normal meal' ever again, yet I can't just binge my face off every single day. I'm not even underweight anymore like I used to so maybe I'm just broken. But the point is, all these people that say 'stop restricting' seem to actually mean 'stop restricting *below a normal amount of food*', they don't ACTUALLY mean 'stop restricting for real' and it's so frustrating.",0.91,8,0,8,,2021-08-29T17:40:42Z,pe5hd1,t3

Hello… I have been thinking about this for months now and I would really appreciate people’s opinions. I might seek professional help with it if people think it’s important. For reference, I am 19 and female.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve done some research, but of course what I have always known the most about is anorexia and bulimia, which I know I do not struggle with. I have not struggled with my body image aside from mild insecurities, and I have been wanting to gain weight for years. I have always been skinny to the point of getting comments/insults on it and people assuming that I am anorexic. In more recent years, I feel that I have the capability to gain weight but I simply find myself not eating enough. Last year, I blamed my weight loss on going to college and not liking the food provided, but this summer I have been home with good food at my disposal and I think I almost eat less. I feel like I’m not doing it on purpose, or that I have a good reason, I’m just not interested or don’t think about it. I am also noticeably getting full faster. I’m sure this is negatively affecting my health but I don’t know how to fix it. Plus, I’m about to move back on campus and I’m afraid I will continue getting progressively worse.

&amp;#x200B;

And it’s not like I don’t get hungry. Like both today and yesterday, I got hungry but I just didn’t eat. I ate one meal throughout the entire day and just ignored my hunger. Why would I do that?

226,EatingDisorders,Request: My GF is spiralling and I'm lost on what to do.," 

I (26M) have been with my GF (26F) for almost two years now. When I met her, she was at a healthy weight, thin, but healthy.

I already knew that, a few years prior to us getting together, she was hospitalized for anorexia nervosa and low weight. She talked about it with normalcy, and it was clear she was better.

During the first few months, she ate normally, and aside from a few comments about her not being perfectly happy with her body, she was stable and mostly okay. 6 months in, she had her first real episode. She said that she was obese and that she wanted to lose X amount of weight. I discouraged it, tried to be supportive, but she was set on losing weight.

I guess at this point I have to talk about her family. Her parents are just terrible, unsupportive and judgmental. Her mother is manipulative and extremely toxic, and her father is a bigot. Their way of dealing with her being unwell is telling or forcing her to eat, calling her names, or lashing out at her.

The thing is, she cares more about what her parents have to say than anything in the world. She craves their approval (which they never give) and makes them a part of everything, knowing that they're going to make everything ten times worse.

She looked like she was getting better, but then she was diagnosed with lactose and fructose intolerance, on top of her celiac disease. This has just been devastating to her mental health and her struggle against anorexia. It started by her losing a bit of weight because her stomach hurts every time she eats, and then it spiraled out of control. To her, the weight she's lost is gone forever, not the consequence of an illness that needs to be corrected, but the start of a weight loss journey.

She's already at the point of being medically underweight, but that doesn't matter. She sets the goal of losing X amount of weight, promising that she will be happy with her body then, then she reaches that weight and moves the goalposts to an even lower weight. Recently she's said that she wants to be exactly at the weight where she's not going to be hospitalized, even though that's severely underweight by any metric.

Sometimes she weighs herself and tries to celebrate with me that she's lost weight. I don't know if that's her trying to manipulate me into enabling her or just an attention-seeking behaviour, but it always leads to her being disappointed and sad that I don't celebrate with her. I don't scold her or anything, I just mention that I wish she didn't put such an emphasis on her weight.

I also can't just try to keep her mind off her weight or weight loss in general. Anything and everything can be twisted to talk about her desire to weight less and her disgust with her body. Try to play a videogame? If the player's avatar can be customized, she will make the most underweight character possible, spending ages trying to ""get the proportions right"". Reading a book? Is any of the characters fat? What do they eat?

She also suffers from GAD and, I suspect, from depression, which she absolutely refuses to even consider. She doesn't enjoy any of her old hobbies, she can't finish books or series, she just browses TikTok endlessly. She used to love her job, now she dreads going back (she's on sick leave). I have to push her to text her best friend of ten years. This all screams ""depression"" to me, someone who has gotten better from depression myself.

She's extremely intelligent and a nurse, which allows her to hide her symptoms when she talks to her psychologist and psychiatrist. She convinces all of her healthcare providers that she's just suffering from anxiety.

I love her, and I want to spend the rest of my life with her. She's everything I could ask for in a woman, but I feel like that woman is slowly being replaced by her illness. I can count with one hand the times that we've had a genuinely good time that didn't involve sex in the last 6 months. I can't go for a walk with her, as not only she doesn't want to leave the house for anything other that driving to go grocery shopping or seeing her parents, but most she will get light-headed if she walks for five minutes.

Last year, during the pandemic, her mother was making her have an anxiety attack everyday, making her life miserable. Throwing her things away (including a gift from her late best friend, who committed suicide years ago), insulting her, shouting, and my GF even told me about an incident when her mother called her obese.

All of this led me to look for an place so we could live together and get her out of her parent's house. This has been at the expense of my own goals. I was studying to get a job that would grant me economical stability for the rest of my life, and I've put that on hold to get a job and pay rent. I've even been on sick leave myself because of migraines I think are associated with stress.

She refuses therapy or treatment on the basis that ""all therapists ask her the same things"". She found A therapist that she liked last year, and left because €70 an hour was ""too expensive"", a few months after buying a €1100 iPhone, and a few months before spending more than €1000 on an iPad, and I offered to help her pay for it despite barely making it paycheck to paycheck, and her father being loaded. Money isn't the issue, and when she feels that she works well with a therapist, she leaves. I know that's what her illness compels her to do, but I cannot help but feel like she doesn't want to get better, and will actively work against it.

Yesterday she said that she wants to have children because that would help her feel better about herself. First, even if I found that believable, which I don't, I think it's horrible to bring a baby into this world as some kind of therapy. Second, she freaks out when her period makes her look a tiny little bit bloated, and I'm genuinely terrified of how she will react to pregnancy.

I'm at my wits end. I know it is not my job to ""fix"" her, but I feel like she just wants me to enable her self-destructive habits and refuses to even make an effort to get better.

227,EatingDisorders,Request: need some advice,"&amp;#x200B;

Looking for advice on how to help my sister. A little overwhelmed with all the information.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister came to me last night and told me she'd been losing a lot of weight and she doesn't feel good, she doesn't feel healthy. She's losing natural body fat and muscle mass. She tried working out to help build body mass but the next day she was bed bound because she had burned calories and stuff during the work out that she doesn't have to burn.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me she will only eat so many calories in a day but most days will not eat. That if she eats something that is more calories than she has set limit to she won't eat for days after to make up for it. But then sometimes she will binge eat and then not eat anything for days after again and she feels really guilty when she binges and that's why she won't eat for days after.

&amp;#x200B;

This has started due to stress and money constraints. She lives on her own and doesn't make a lot of money.

&amp;#x200B;

She mostly eats vegetables and fruits and tofu. She's not a big meat eater.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked if she had done any research and she said she tried but it scared her. So I offered to look into it for her and provide her with information she is looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

However I don't know where to start. I don't even know what for of eating disorder this is classified as.

&amp;#x200B;

I googled, I looked through the links on this sub and I tried looking at some other posts but this is all very overwhelming and I'm just hoping someone can maybe help advise on some things that maybe I don't know or which direction to start.

&amp;#x200B;

I welcome any and all advice I just want to help her the best I can and support her any way she needs it. Any help and advise would mean a lot to me.

I go thru phases where im restricting food from myself or eating salads or only one time a day for a while and then i end up slipping back into a binge eventually. These past few weeks has been the worst it’s ever gotten to. The only thing that stopped this bingeing episode was the fact that i got my wisdom teeth taken out 5 days ago and i havent been able to eat anything. Im scared that once im healed up I’ll just slip right back into those ways no matter how much i know i should stop, want to stop. I just don’t know what to do or if this is something i should even talk to someone about. Like is it really that serious? I keep downplaying it, but i just dont know.

234,EatingDisorders,"Request: Is something wrong with me? Could this be anorexia, body dysmorphia or something else entirely?","I'll preface this by saying I'm a transgender woman. I'm 24, 5'7 and my weight has always been considered ""normal"" for BMI male standards and whatnot. In fact, my BMI still counts as normal. Basically, I never had any problems with being under/overweight but I always counted calories and felt bad about eating, especially when I binged a couple of times.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have been severely restricting my meals lately. I still eat every 4 to 5 hours because of gastritis (severe heartburn if I fast too often), but I'm still hungry 24/7. I used to do intermittent fasting and I loved doing that, but had to stop. Also I have been doing cardio everyday, not as a ""cheat way"" to eat more, but because I just want to speed up the process. Very low cal and cardio have nuked my weight in the last month.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the thing is that I absolutely hate not only my body, but also any sort of fat in me, especially the belly area. To me, I just think I'm in a super strict diet and took some inspiration from pro-anorexia communities. And probably because of this, I developed some very bad habits such as weighing multiple times a day and basically I just got addicted to seeing the numbers go down every single day. I know I know, just being in a community like this is wrong, but still.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I don't want to develop an ED, but I do plan on staying like this for a while until I think I'm skinny enough. My parents won't stop saying that I look too skinny already, and sometimes I lie to them about having eaten when in reality I didn't. Some of my friends also told me they are worried because of my appearance. One of them even suggested I could have anorexia, and at that time I was eating normally. I thought she was completely overreacting, but now I'm reconsidering that because of my current habits and goals. I just cannot see anything wrong with it, because I'm still very far from my goal, and it feels like they are all picking on me because they don't want me to be skinny for whatever reason. Sometimes I also have nightmares regarding binge eating. And last but not least, maybe I'm just doing this for attention? Tho I really only told about this to a single friend who wasn't very judgmental. Like with the same argument people use for self-harmers, which... is also something I did. I also used to starve sometimes for self-harm purposes, but I can't do it right now due to the mentioned gastritis, but I would if I could, so I had to switch my method.",0.86,10,0,10,,2021-08-26T04:26:54Z,pbvywc,t3
235,EatingDisorders,Request: I don't know if this counts as an ED or not," 

When I was 14, I started struggling a lot with my weight. It was all I could think about, and I started eating a lot less. I don't want to go into everything that happened during this time, but my behavior was definitely concerning. The only reason it didn't get worse was because of a traumatic event that occurred that made it hard to think about anything else. Obviously the thoughts and certain behaviors didn't completely go away, but it wasn't as much of a problem. I'm 17 now.

If I gain even a little bit of weight, I hate myself and immediately start eating less. I frequently think I weigh too much (I'm currently at a healthy weight), and have thoughts of restricting my eating daily. The only reason I haven't is because my energy decreases very quickly and I feel like I'm going to pass out, become extremely dizzy, and can hardly stand up if I go more than 4-5 hours without food, whether I'm hungry or not.

That's quite literally the only thing preventing me from eating less, and I hate it. I don't feel like any of my thoughts or feelings regarding my weight and food in general are serious enough because I don't have a choice but to eat every few hours, even if it's just a small snack, so I don't pass out.

It doesn't help that I can't eat a lot of things sometimes feeling nauseous. I hate this cycle of ""have to eat regularly so I don't pass out, but can hardly even eat anything without feeling nauseous, and hate myself for eating when I do.""

There's a lot I didn't mention, and I know this mindset isn't healthy, but does this still count as an ED or disordered eating?",1,4,0,4,,2021-08-24T04:45:57Z,pak2nh,t3

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, over the past week or so, I’ve been dehydrating myself—which is something I’ve done before, but usually I can talk myself out of it before it gets this bad. It’s been taking over my life and making it difficult for me to do anything else, as well as affecting me physically by making me very constipated (sorry for TMI), but for whatever reason I can’t stop. I don’t know how long this is going to last, and I’m worried I might eventually stop drinking water altogether and land myself in the hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve mostly been eating food like normal, though. The few times I skipped meals, it was because I was worried eating would make me thirsty and I’d end up drinking water, and I hated the thought of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m okay with my weight and body shape, so I know this isn’t related to a body image issue. Honestly, I think it’s just a really shitty grab for control. For whatever reason, I experience a lot of anxiety around peeing (I’m sorry, I know that doesn’t make sense but I just do lmao), and dehydrating limits my bathroom trips which is nice and also kinda why I started in the first place lmao. The problem is I know this could damage my body if I continue, but I can’t stop.

I’m sorry if this is the wrong sub for this, but I didn’t know where else to ask. Could this be an ED, but somehow only with water/liquids and not food???

239,EatingDisorders,Recruiting NYC area participants for academic research,"I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). Eligible participants should be staying/living within 60 minutes travel distance of Manhattan (New York, NY, USA) to participate. The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and twelve sessions of tDCS during six visits over two weeks. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from your own home–no in-person visits are required.

&amp;#x200B;

Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

Questionnaire answers and data collected during the task may be used in future studies, and if shared with other investigators, information that identifies the scan, questionnaire responses, or task data with you will be removed beforehand. There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality from such data sharing, but this is extremely low as only de-identified data from this study may be shared.

Clinical records, including your name and other personal identifying information, and research data will be kept in secure storage at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Information in paper format will be kept in locked files. Electronic data will be protected by a firewall (programming that makes it virtually impossible to access the data from outside the New York State Psychiatric Institute) and by restricting access within the New York State Psychiatric Institute through use of a password known only to authorized personnel. If information is transmitted electronically, it will be encrypted so that your identifying information remains confidential

&amp;#x200B;

Records will be available to research staff, and to Federal, State, and Institutional regulatory personnel (who may review records as part of routine audits). Your information will also be available to other authorized individuals, including those at the New York State Psychiatric Institute.

Hi, I've struggled with what I believe to be an eating disorder for about a year now, although the intensity of it has fluctuated.

But with this I've noticed I've started getting way hungrier, like usually I can last about 24 hours without eating and feel alright but since I've been eating better I can only last about 8. I guess this is just my body getting back into how it used to be but it's all happened so suddenly, and its weird because I didn't even do this with the intent to ""recover"", I've just been eating more.

Hi, my girlfriend is struggling with an ED and I really don’t know how to help her properly. I’ve done my research to better understand how an eating disorder works, what it does, what it feels like, and what it is. I know so much more than I did initially, but because of the distance between me and her I still don’t know what to do or say properly.

I understand I don’t have the power to fix this problem, I understand I can’t control how she eats or perceives herself, and I am not in control of her relapses. I encourage her to talk about how she feels and I try to be there to listen more than anything else. If she doesn’t want to talk about it or feels uncomfortable I let her know it’s okay and I change the subject. I let her know she is important and she matters, as well as her health.

I suggested to her a doctor or therapist but she doesn’t think her condition needs help. She doesn’t want to seek help or get better, and I understand I am not in control of that. It hurts my heart when she talks to me about her negative self image, and talks about getting worse. I feel really helpless in situations like this and I don’t know what to say that would help her.

The only thing that has ever slightly reassured me during this time was a scale I had in my bathroom, because at least then I can confirm what is happening to my body. Unfortunately, my mum hid my scale somewhere three weeks ago, and she won’t give it back. She says that my emotional outbursts over the scale are proof that I have an unhealthy relationship with it. “It’s my house, so I decide how to keep you healthy,” she said. I’m 20.

It just feels really punitive and cruel. I had been gaining a lot of weight in the weeks leading up to my mother hiding the scale, and the weeks without the scale have felt no different. I can feel and see myself growing. Without my scale, I fear my body is truly out of my control, and I hate that feeling.

255,EatingDisorders,Request: I've been struggling with food a bit and I would like some advice," 

Hi!

I've never been diagnosed with an eating disorder but I've been on and off restricting for years now. I had good months, bad ones but I've never needed help. Recently I had a really bad few months, it took very long and I was getting worried. Restricting never lasted so long before. I went to my doctor and he advised to visit a dietician but I'm still young and studying and do not have money for that. Instead I decided to let go of all my food rules. I started slow, including fear foods in my daily diet, but now I started binging. I did some research and I think it might be extreme hunger. I do not know it is possible for me to experience it. I can just eat and eat and eat until I'm so stuffed I've never been before and all I can do is think about my next meal. It takes an hour or so and I'm hungry again. I've tried to not give in, but I read that you should give in to this extreme hunger so I did for a week or so. Today alone I ate as much as I would in 2,5 days. I've gained some weight already (note: I've never been underweight and have always had a healthy weight) I feel fat, sick and I end up crying in my bed everyday because of how much I ate. I can't believe I'm still hungry after all I've eaten.

Is this extreme hunger or binging? And does anyone have any tips for recovering without any help? I think I can do it alone since my disordered eating was never bad enough to be an eating disorder.",1,12,0,12,,2021-08-19T20:25:07Z,p7s7bu,t3

I don't really exercise, I did for a bit a few months ago but now I've stopped. if I feel hungry I just drink water or eat something small like a strawberry for example and then I'm not as hungry. I'm already slightly underweight but I still want to be thinner and want the numbers on the scale to go down. started doing this around the beginning of 2021 but also did a very similar thing in summer of 2018 or 2019 (can't remember). should I be worried about this or is this just normal and I'm fine?",1,7,0,7,,2021-08-19T20:23:53Z,p7s6le,t3
257,EatingDisorders,request: i feel so ashamed but also angry at myself,"in the past year i (19f) gained weight and it’s easily noticeable, i don’t even fit into the clothes i bought in december (which were already bigger than what i used to wear). i’m stuck in the mindset that i should purposefully not eat for an extended period of time to punish myself for eating out or having certain high calorie foods. for example, if i go out with friends and we all go to a restaurant, i’d be very self conscious about what i eat there but still feel very ashamed when i come home, that i feel like i need to not eat for the next day. naturally i’d get hungry, but i’d think that giving in to the hunger is a sign of weakness and i should hold out on not eating. i beat myself up for getting hungry, and when i finally do eat something it’s like i completely failed my goal.

&amp;#x200B;

when it comes to the choice of food, i think i have an addiction to spending money on takeout or delivery rather than making something healthier at home. i can’t control the urges to pick up my phone and order something (often in bigger amounts than i need), and feel disgusted and angry at myself for doing that after i’ve eaten. the cycle repeats itself from there, so i’d go through eating a lot —&gt; not eating to punish myself.

i know it’s not healthy but i hate the way i look so much and i want to be like my friends who try on a medium at the store and still feel it’s too “loose” on them. i’ve been skinny growing up and was labelled underweight, but in the past couple years with lockdown, medication and health issues i’ve had to repurchase my entire wardrobe because nothing i had fits me anymore. i feel so fat and ashamed that i’m no longer a size X, and so guilty that i can’t control my urges to eat.

260,EatingDisorders,Request: Triggered by unintentionally becoming underweight,"I have unhealthy body image issues, but only when I'm underweight. I would love to know if anyone can relate. I used to have some disordered eating patterns in my late teens (I'm currently 24). I've always been on the lower end of the healthy BMI range. I do fluctuate a bit, like most people do, but I'm usually comfortable in my body no matter what shape it's in. I don't really feel the need or desire to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

However, when I do happen to lose weight, as I recently unintentionally did, it sometimes triggers something in me. Whenever I reach or cross the threshold of being underweight, I become hyper-aware of my body. I look at the signs of being a tad too skinny (very visible collarbones, sternum slightly poking through, etc.). I don't think it's particularly attractive, but I'm not repulsed by it either; instead it's almost like I'm fascinated by it. Body-image wise, I know that if I were to gain the weight back and be within my typical range, I would feel perfectly fine, and I wouldn't think about it anymore - I'd be back to normal. I'd be happy to get some volume back in my chest, in fact. It's not even that big of difference in my weight or how my body looks, but just knowing I'm under the normal range is what triggers me. A part of me wants to stay this way. I think I like the idea of being ""tiny"", and maybe even of people expressing concern for me. I hate that mindset.

&amp;#x200B;

And I hate that I wasn't even actively trying to lose it, but now that I have, I need to be careful. The few times I noticed this in the past, I got out of it pretty easily. I have no issues with food anymore, and eat rather intuitively. But over the last few months, due to depression and medication, my appetite and interest in food are lower, so it's easier to think that my weight loss is ""inevitable"", and harder to get back to normal. I'm not restricting myself, but I'm also not putting in the effort to eat more.

Hey all. Recently I walked in on my wife self purging. Since we have had some talk related to the ED, her, and my role in her recovery. Today, maybe 7 months after, somethings still seem odd/ off but I can't keep asking her all the time.

 1) she reports it's been some time since the last purge. But she does to the bath room during meals. Now, to me, it sounds like there is a very quick like burst of water that enters the toilet then 5 seconds later the sound of a woman peeing. I thought a pre pee poop, but it's all the time. Do people with ED purge that fast?

 2) pre bed habits- again the bathroom thing, then after a flush she stands by the toilet a little long (again like 10 seconds). Brushes teeth, then flossing like crazy. She will take a shot of backing soda. Drink some water, then make a baking soda water. She reports acid reflex. 

3) does this seem like behaviors of it being a daily thing? Is it that fast or if she's in the bathroom for 45 seconds I shouldn't worry? Are these eating disorder coaches a real thing? She listens to odd pod cast sometimes and they talk about body issues (maybe positive things but I have only heard negative). Then how can I help or ask? We've been trying for a year and half for a kid and we both are ""normal"" but I don't think she told Docs about a ED. Would it be an issue if it was every now and then or is it an issue because it's more often then she tells me?

I also have a mom, twin sister, and older brother (m25). Of the siblings I am the closest with my dad.

&amp;#x200B;

My Dad is a no-nonsense, no-emotion, would never ask for help, would never go for counselling kind of guy. However he has lost a significant amount of weight over the summer due to his small meals, and his 3-6 hours of exercise a day. My whole family is aware of his current habits.

He normally has oatmeal for breakfast, an apple or carrots for lunch, and a really small dinner (like a salad). First of all he is not even eating enough for someone his size even if the person was inactive. Second, because he works out so much he should be eating way more. He is also constantly weighing himself and bringing up his weight in conversation, saying that he thought he should have lost more weight.

I want to help him, but this is different because it’s my dad, and because he has a tricky ego complex. How do I encourage healthy habits and how do in recommend that he seeks medical advice?

I’ve been restricting my food for awhile as well as on and off counting calories (habits which I get from being a competitive gymnast). Recently it’s gotten much worse and I’m not sure why… I basically eat a peach for breakfast, an apple for lunch, try to workout to “remove” the calories of what I ate. Then I have to eat dinner with my family and I can’t control what I eat so I eat enough to not make my parents worry but then after when I’m alone I try to throw it up. It hasn’t worked which is maybe for the better. But when vomiting doesn’t work I work out again.

Went to a gastroenterologist, got put on a few medications, I even ended up getting a damn endoscopy / colonoscopy.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR Sister is getting help in public hospital but her treatment seems too restrictive and we worry it's going to make things worse**

&amp;#x200B;

My sister(19) has been purging for months and her weight is at an all time low, also starting to showing symptoms like muscle pain, teeth problems these few weeks. From what we know she's also diagnosed with anxiety but not delusional, is very smart and highly self aware of her problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Few days ago her counsellor advised her to be institutionalized, she agreed so we took her to a public hospital and she just got transferred to a mental unit yesterday, with her consent of course. By then all her personal items are taken away, which I understand. **Problem is they also took away her books, which to me seems very innocuous. We were told that the psychiatrist won't be able to see her until a week later. She probably won't have a counsellor aside from drugs. Also visitors are not allowed, not because of covid, but it's just a rule.**

&amp;#x200B;

It's great to have free healthcare here and I understand inpatient treatment comes with a lot of restrictions, the lack of doctors is a sad reality we have to accept, but the book thing seems too extreme to us. But if they're giving her all this free time and not doing anything special, why can't she at least read?

&amp;#x200B;

Is inpatient treatment supposed to be this restrictive? We're tempted to get her out of there however we can't afford private hospitals.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been living with restrictive eating for 30+ years, I have severe PTSD and moderate to severe depression plus now, a little postpartum (hormones and all) added in. I gained… well we don’t do numbers here so I’ll tell you I doubled in size during pregnancy because the second I found out I stopped restricting bc I was worried about the baby and woooow it went on fast.

&amp;#x200B;

I had my little princess 7 months ago- there were problems. She is ok and healthy and bouncy, I am still doing physical therapy and occupational therapy and speech. Getting better but not where I need to be yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I lost most of the baby weight within 4 months. Hubby pointed out he doesn’t want me to ever be sooooo small again as I got after our first child (I almost died from it). I spoke to my trauma therapist and most of my motivation actually came from wanting to set a better example for my daughter on what a good relationship with food and your own body can be. With his help, I started treatment for ED (now with new onset of binging and purging associated with a self destructive mindset that awakens during flashbacks or whenever I’m physically unable to do things).

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been slowly increasing intake with my team and doing all the feelings stuff etc. within 4 weeks of starting, I gained it ALL back and then some. I’m now well above a healthy BMI. I asked about it and whether I could start trying to slow the gain soon- I was told to love myself even if I get huge.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk what to do. My goals of losing the baby weight are being ignored, I don’t want to do it in a disordered way but I want to feel normal again. Do I switch out the team members who are not supporting my goals (goal is to lose excess weight and still remain 1/2 way between the low and high end of my healthy range).

281,EatingDisorders,Request: I think I might have/be starting to develop an Eating Disorder,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

So, first of all, I am 16 and male (trans). My weight is normal.

Ever since I was little, I would feel really uncomfortable with the thought of being overweight or overeating, to the point where I would cry because the thoughts wouldn't leave me alone. They'd come when I was around food, so in ""normal"" circumstances, or at completely random times. Sometimes I'd imagine people I know overeating/being overfed, and gaining a lot of weight - not on purpose, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

To this day, I have this same problem. I'm still getting sick from these thoughts and I generally avoid eating too much for that same reason.

&amp;#x200B;

When I started puberty, I also started gaining weight, which is normal, but I hated it. I loathed having fat rolls here and there, or a small double chin, or a stomach that wasn't unrealistically flat. Fot that reason, I started restricting my eating habits around two years ago. Skipping full meals doesn't work when I'm at home, so I just do that when I'm not - which is about once a week. I then skip lunch entirely and only eat a small dinner. Other than that, I try not to eat unhealthy snacks. I often realise how much I've eaten on a day and I then get angry at myself and start crying again. Reading about calories just makes me feel bad over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I really love cooking and baking, and during lockdown I used to bake a lot, but I rarely ever ate what I made, out of fear. Outside of that, I mostly stayed at home during that time, so I was even more concerned with my own weight.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also tried to work out. I'm sadly not a very disciplined person, so I rarely ever actually work out, but I really hate myself for this every night. My weight and the way my body looks just makes me cry and I am trying my best to change this.

Several years ago my stepdaughter was admitted to the hospital almost in a coma because her mom had starved her over time. From what I gather, the mother was convinced they should only eat organic/non-gmo (which isn’t a bad thing ofc), but there are a lot of holes in the story. For one, the mom was underweight but relatively healthy. My stepdaughter weighed half what would have been appropriate.

Now she’s better, in terms of getting enough calories. Shes still in a skilled nursing facility because, while she’s out of the woods, her mom has bred distrust and apathy. The thinking is sort of ‘why bother doing for myself because I just always hurt and everyone is mad at me and I’ll just try to be very small so as not to bother…’ It’s problematic, but my goals are to bolster self esteem and confidence.

Anyway she’s at goal weight but someone suggested her skewed view of food and eating might mean she has an eating disorder(?)

This is new for me but I think counseling would help. I’m encouraging her to talk to someone (she has access but no desire). Beyond that, though, I’d like to find out what small things I can do to assist.

Is this an ED? Could her constant pain be a lasting effect? What other lasting effects could this have caused?

Does anyone know of any books or theories that may be helpful? Or if anyone has gone through this sort of Munchausen(by proxy)-esque forced/complicit starvation..?

289,EatingDisorders,"Request: I'm worried I have an eating disorder, does this count?"," 

When  I was 16 I obsessed with my weight and weighed myself multiple times a  day. If the number changed even a little I was immediately restricting  my already extremely restricted diet. My parents would always serve me  up a smaller portion of food compared to my brothers. I barely ate and  if I gained any weight my Mum would comment on me getting chubby, and  grab any belly fat that I had. For reference I was about 5'8 at the time  and weighed xx kgs (normal range). I thought I was fat. When my parents weren't looking  I would sneak into the pantry and binge on any and all 'bad' food I  could. I would eat the baking chocolate, biscuits, museli bars,  everything. My parents kept bells on their snack cupboard so we couldn't  help ourselves, it'd been this way since we were little and continued  until we moved out.  I eventually got a job in a supermarket and had  ready access to foods I wasn't 'allowed because they'd make me fat' so I  started bingeing at work, buying copious amounts of food at work and  stuffing my face on my breaks. I'd come home and hide food in my room.  This lead to massive weight gain and more and more comments my weight  and appearance. I thought I looked disgusting but couldn't stop.  Eventually things balanced out and I lost a lot of the extra weight  through reducing sugar and healthy eating along with exercise. But I  still saw myself as fat. Still couldn't see that I'd changed my body. 

Since then, I have a horrible relationship with my body and with  food. I struggle with body dysmorphia on the daily. Some days seeing  myself as so huge and disgusting I want to never look at myself again,  and others viewing myself as 'normal' but then not fitting into my  clothes size as they're suddenly too small. And so the cycle goes, round  and around. 

I hide food constantly, sneak snacks, binge on foods like I'll never  have it again, then buy more. I feel so ashamed tucking away bags of  m&amp;Ms or bars of chocolate but can't help it, I crave the sugar and  snacks and can't stop myself. 

I have had a baby, 11mo, and my body has changed again. Breastfeeding  has me starving 80% of the time and often I get so hungry there doesn't  feel like any time at all to make food so I reach for what is ready  available- which often means things that are higher in calories and  sugar. I am huge, the biggest I've ever been on the scale. I'm obsessed,  and most of the time hate the way I look. Each time I see a photo of  myself or see my reflection, all I see is the fat, the chin, my  stomach... I adore my stretch marks because they're a sign of my baby,  permanently carved into my body, but the weight that goes along with  it... I hide my body under baggy clothes... I don't know what to do. 

I don't have the energy to work out, I'm dealing with a broken bone  that is still causing pain 5 months later... Pain all over my body... 

So does this count? Is it bingeing? I've been gaslit a lot by my parents so don't trust myself  I think it is... I need help... What are the next steps? What do I do? I'm heartbroken...",0.81,3,0,3,,2021-08-11T11:18:17Z,p2gbyr,t3

My b/p has gotten absolutely out of control lately  and I'm scared to DEATH. I've been struggling with occasional purging  for a few years now but my main problem used to be restriction and until  the last couple months I had never purged this much this frequently.  I'm already feeling the physical effects, my mouth is sore, my teeth  feel sensitive and my stomach burns.

I really really need to stop asap. But I know that if I stop purging I  will just keep binging and the mere thought of weight gain completely  terrifies me. I've tried keeping a binge down but the feeling of dread  and sheer panic over weight gain was completely unbearable so I only  lasted less than an hour before rushing to the toilet.

The fact is, I'm no longer underweight so I feel like I have no  ""room"" to binge anymore, which only worsens the anxiety around binges.

I've tried everything. I have a therapist who no longer knows what to  do with me because I never improve. I have a meal plan and it's not  helping. I try following it and eating ""balanced meals"" and they never  satisfy me so in the end I binge anyway. I don't understand the concept  of ""stop restricting"" because for me it just means binging (and  generally eating ALL THE FOOD). I'm not underweight and I'm only a few  lbs below my pre-ED weight so that cannot make much of a difference.  With my therapist I've even tried to journal to detect if my binges are  associated to any emotional patterns but we couldn't find any. I binge  when I'm happy and when I'm sad, I binge when I have a lot of feelings  to process and when everything's quiet, I binge when I'm busy and when  I'm not busy, I binge when I have lunch and when I don't. And then  obviously I purge every single time because I can't stand the weight  gain.

I'm constantly hungry, constantly scared and nervous and don't know  what to do anymore. I feel completely desperate and hopeless. When I was  purely restrictive (or restriction + binges) I still felt shit all the  time but at least my teeth weren't getting destroyed by the day.",1,2,0,2,,2021-08-09T18:14:02Z,p1cxhb,t3
292,EatingDisorders,Request: Is there anything more I can do to help my partner with his eating disorder?," 

I have dealt with an eating disorder as a form of self harm  (restricting and purging) for about two years. It was mostly unrelated  to weight as I was already underweight when it started. As time went on I  punished myself for being so underweight that I would continue to  starve myself. I've been recoved for about two years and have no real  triggers and I don't see myself at risk of relapse. That's not what this  is about, just background.

My boyfriend of a year now confessed to me in June that he believes  he has an eating disorder. His family has mocked his weight since he was  8 years old, forced him to go onto diets, etc. He still lives at home  and is constantly mocked for his weight and compared to his siblings.  But what baffles me is that he is not overweight. He would still be  perfect in my eyes if he was, I just don't understand where the comments  are coming from. I suppose he could be described as chubby but I  absolutely couldn't see him as overweight to any extreme amount. He has a  very distorted self image due to a lifetime of being mocked and shamed  by his family.

In June he told me that a few months before he'd started using a  calorie tracking app and it had spiraled out of control. He often eats  twice a day, at dinner and whatever he can find after midnight. It's  very obviously not enough as he's constantly feeling sick, bruising  easily, having memory issues and is exhausted most of the day. He's also  very depressed a lot of the time, sleeping about 14 hours a day,  isolating himself at times, etc. It hurts to watch him struggle and know  that there isn't anything I can really do. If he was anyone else I  would tell someone close to him that could help him, but I worry the  people he stays with would even encourage it.

He's self aware, knows it's harmful and says he just doesn't know how  to break the pattern. I offer advice (from my own experience and things  I read online) and support, compliment him on things unrelated to his  appearance unless comments on his body are welcomed. I'm doing  everything I can find to do and I know that he's been getting better  instead of worse, but it hurts so bad to watch him struggle in a similar  way I did.

I am never alone, and have come to the realisation that anyone even  being in the house deters me from eating. I have not eaten for more than  a week. I don't feel like I can ask my roommate to leave the house for  several hours, just so I might eat. I am a very slow eater, most likely  due to IBS, and a simple meal might take me an hour to consume. 

I have previously been a foodie, and always loved baking and cooking  so this is quite upsetting. I can't even get myself to use utensils, or  have anything that might smell and bother others. 

Anyone have any suggestions on how to be okay with others being near when you eat/ know that you are eating?

Also, should I be worried about RFS?",1,8,0,8,,2021-08-09T18:12:22Z,p1cwdf,t3
294,EatingDisorders,"Request: Resources for people with an eating disorder past, who must take care of kids' meals?"," 

Hi, I'm not finding a lot of resources for parents  who themselves have an eating disorder. My partner has a 6 yo and my biggest fear is that I might do something  that would promote an unhealthy relationship with food. I'd like to have  tools and strategies for dealing with kids at mealtime and especially  when they are picky eaters.  Thanks!",1,13,0,13,,2021-08-09T18:11:36Z,p1cvvc,t3
295,EatingDisorders,Request: Seeking a way out," 

I struggled with binge eating disorder and bulimia  for years and it’s starting to reach a head. I’ve told myself I would  never resort back to bulimia after I nearly choked on my own vomit, but  I’ve been binging a lot lately and it’s made me feel very worthless.  Since I was young I dealt with a lot of abuse and stress and food was my  only way to cope. I eventually found more productive activities like  drawing, writing, and skateboarding, but lately I’ve resorted back to  binge eating. It’s taking a huge hit to my self esteem and it feels like  an inescapable hole. I eat because I’m depressed, then I’m depressed  because I eat. I’ve never really told anyone about my disorder, because  I’m a guy and people don’t take it seriously or think it’s a “feminine”  thing. This is the lowest I’ve been and I’m seeking a way out.",1,6,0,6,,2021-08-09T18:10:43Z,p1cv9v,t3
296,EatingDisorders,Request: My girlfriend of 5 years has an eating disorder.," 

What can I do to help her? I'm unsure of when exactly  it started but she told me within the first 6 months of dating. She  told me her brother and others would make fun of her for being  overweight by her brother and some people at school when she was in  middle school and high school, so I can assume it started around 10  years ago since she is 25. She is like 5' 7 and maybe weighs xxx pounds (very thin)  now. Her parents know but I'm not sure to the extent, since they never  mention it. They are probably just pretending it's not a problem because  they feel bad/helpless. Heck, I'm not even sure how often she does it  because we don't live together, but I do know she has acid reflux and  sensitive teeth because of it. I try sometimes to talk about it but she  just says that she has good days and bad days sometimes. I've told her  to talk to a professional because I feel helpless, but she gets  defensive. I'm at a loss. I love her and want to help her to the best of  my ability.",0.94,52,0,52,,2021-08-09T18:09:42Z,p1cul0,t3

Hi, everyone!

Just reposting this one last time here as this community has been  hugely helpful in gathering responses. So many thanks. It's all hugely  appreciated. 

My research explores hedonic hunger, which is eating for pleasure,  which is why I included that in the title and not the term ""hedonic  hunger"". Hedonic hunger is a relatively novel (coined in just 2007) and  under-researched area.

Eligibility Requirements: a) must be 18 years old or older, b) must be proficient enough in English to complete a survey in the language  c) must reside in Australia.

You don't necessarily have to eat for pleasure to participate, thus is not an exclusion criterion.

Read the participant information before deciding if completing the  survey is right for you because despite me using questionnaires that  were carefully considered as to not cause much distress, most questions  do involve eating behaviours. You'll see the information on this once  you open the survey and read through the introduction. 

All interested and eligible are warmly welcome to participate in the survey. 

It's only comprised of 99 questions. The link will take you to all the information you need.

Link: [https://acap.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_eXNqmgqbkhFbTiS](https://acap.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eXNqmgqbkhFbTiS)

Responses will be used in composing my 12,000 word thesis for my  Bachelor of Psychological Sciencr Degree at the Australian College of  Applied Psychology. 

All of your responses will be kept totally confidential, I won't have  any way of telling them apart even as the researcher. No identifying  information is collected. I won't even know how you stumbled upon the  link (be it through a text message, Facebook group, Reddit post, etc.)  as the link is totally anonymous. 

I'll never reveal specific groups, subreddits or any other specific  details on where the survey has been posted. It'll only be briefly  mentioned in my method section that I used social media sites and I'll  list some general names that can't identify any as a participant  directly (eg. Facebook, Reddit, LinkedIn, etc.)

I am under supervision of a highly experienced professor of  Psychological Sciences at my college. The research has also been fully  approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at ACAP (Approval No.  742250621)

Feel free to share the link around with anyone that might ne  interested, using any medium of communication. I'm hoping to gather as  many responses as possible to be able to find as much significant  information on the topic as possible. 

Thank you, all! Every bit counts and I appreciate any involvement.",1,2,0,2,,2021-08-09T18:08:00Z,p1ctje,t3

As  the title says, I think I have an eating disorder. Everything started  about 1 year ago: I got kinda addicted to workout videos and trying to  reach the perfect body shape.  I endend up losing way too much kilos in  just two months- but I felt beautiful and perfect and healthy and  accepted.

During that period, I  stared eating less and less while occasionally having binge eating  episodes during which I ate way too much for my body.

I was scared of eating - I still kinda am.

I count calories and I'm at that point in which I know how many calories there are in a dish by heart.

But  is it really an ED? During the last month I gained that weight right  back and I ate a lot, without restricting and counting and weighting  myself.

I feel like shit and I  tell myself I'll get right back on track with cutting off calories and  workouts but that only leads me to eat more and binge.

I hate my body and how chubby it has become. I don't feel attractive anymore. I just want to be as skinny as I was before.

Every  single waking moment is spent thinking about how much I have to not eat  to be beautiful again, how many hours of workout I have to do in order  to get in shape and how I just wanto to use a pair of scissors to cut  all the excess fat.",1,2,0,2,,2021-08-09T18:06:30Z,p1csk7,t3
299,EatingDisorders,Request: How to get out of the mindset that I need to lose weight?," 

Hi!

So, after trying to recover for the first time and relapsing which  lasted about a month, I've decided to try recovery again. I've been  recovering for a few days now and eating at maintenance, so I know I  won't gain or lose weight (I'm at a healthy weight. I don't see a reason  for me to gain and I'm happy eating at maintenance). Yet, whenever I  get on the scale in the morning and expect weight loss, I'm disappointed  each time I maintain.  It's stupid because I'm not in a deficit  anymore, I don't know how to get the idea of ""you need to lose more  weight"" out of my head because I know I don't need to. I don't know how  to accept the fact that I'm fine where I am.",1,6,0,6,,2021-08-09T18:05:11Z,p1crqz,t3
