1,ilostmyself.98,10/13/2021,recovery for me is hell,"Hi everyone.
I have been a member it says for 1 month and 4 weeks. I realized I have an eating disorder caused by stress and living in a toxic environment. here's a bit of my back story since this is the only place I feel safe.as a kid my cousins used to make me feel uncomfortable. it came to the point where I started listening to my body. my body was trying to tell me to be scared this isn't normal. here I am 23 years old with my own daughter now. anytime I look at her I get flashbacks about the things I faced. I know its not her fault but it haunts me. I now have people asking me how I lost weight so fast or wow Im used to you being thick or hey your losing weight. why dont people realize that these things puts us in a deeper hole. I know I shouldn't let their words get to me but it does and it hurts and I feel like im never getting out of this alive.I feel like im drowning and everyone is just watching me sink to the bottom throwing me short pieces of rope to ""help"" but is it really helping? or is it just to make them feel better about themselves?im having gallbladder issues because the drastic weight drop and prior to this I spoke to my dr about having an eating disorder and needing to take steps Into recovery. so we started me with therapy. now she's telling me its my fault that im going through these gallbladder issues because I lost too much weight as if I told her this is what I wanted to do. I never wanted to lose weight I've been depressed and alone without really being alone cause I have my man aka my daughters father but he's always at work so again alone.I also get these awful pains in my knees ankles back just all round body aches and pains. is that normal? has anyone else felt this way? I feel like a zombie at times. I also get hungry pains but no motivation to get up and eat something as I should.I have no friends because any friend I get they just start issues so that the friendship can end and then im the bad guy. I had a friend who sabotaged our living space knowing I have a child and I can't work cause im a stay at home mom and still to this day won't take accountability for it. she tried making it my fault and then bring things up that didnt have to do with the current situation.I feel like im better off forgotten.but that's not what I want. I want to love myself again. I want to feel like someone again. I just want my life back.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,11/15/2021-4:37pm","Dear ilostmyself.98,We would","Dear ilostmyself.98,We would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove the details of the trauma that you have experienced.

2,lulu601,10/11/2021,very strong urge to relapse ,"hi everyone - i’m here again,from the last time i spoke about wanting to relapse those urges still haven’t gone away and they’re becoming stronger and stronger. about a week ago i even weighed myself for the first time in months and i brought out my fitbit - i was planning on relapsing again. but i have exams and i know that if i relapse i will not be able to study for them and they see extremely important exams. i even made an account dedicated to my ed on twt hoping i’d keep myself accountable but i can’t go back to it. i know what i’m doing is bad and i know how harmful my ed is for me but i really miss the addicting feeling of fasting and the high i’d get after not eating for a day. i miss the feeling of an empty stomach and i miss being weak and tired all the time. as stupid as it sounds i miss my ed and i really want to relapse. but at the same time i can’t just because i’m so far into recovery i don’t think i’ll be able to restrict like how i used to 2 years ago. yes i’ve been in recovery for nearly 2 years now and i suddenly want to relapse.truth be told i just simply cannot stand this body - it’s not unfamiliar because i’ve been this weight for months but i’ll never be able to get used to it. i feel so ashamed about it. i’m so incredibly insecure about it - i can’t even explain the way i feel about my body. i feel like i don’t deserve to recover i feel like i don’t deserve to eat. i want to punish myself and starve myself again but i don’t want to go back to my ed hell. because the binges were horrid - the hair loss was terrifying. i was always on the verge of crying because of how sensitive i was. although i know all of this i still want to go back to it i’m literally sayinf opposite things i feel pathetic.i don’t recognise myself. i’m a lot - and i’m not exaggerating serious a lot higher than my pre ed weight. i used to reassure myself that the overshoot would go away and i’d go back to my pre ed weight but i know it’s a lie. i keep deluding myself into thinking i’ll naturally lose the overshoot.i’ve never been at this weight in my life - my weight was very stable before my ed and it wasn’t even that different to ny lowest weight but now i’m so much higher than what i was before my ed even started. i feel so ashamed. words cannot describe how much hatred i have towards my body. i would do anything to lose weight naturally. on social media especially tt there are many glow up trends and their ‘glow up’ is basically weight loss. it’s so triggering and it keeps reinforcing the idea that losing weight is glowing up.maybe it’s our beauty standards but i think i look better when im thinner and i want to go back to that so badly. please help i don’t know what to do. im feeling even more suicidal bc of my ed and the immense pressure of school. i’ve burnt out and im not even able to shower or clean my room. this all happened when i gained weight and bc of my ed. i wish i never went on that stupid diet - my body was fine before my ed - i just completely ruined it. is there any hope of my body going back to how it was before my ed started - bc if not i know i’ll definitely relapse. even if it does i literally can’t stand another day beinf this huge.i really apologise if ive triggered anybody - i’m just in a really negative place right now and my ed voice is really loud. please don’t take anything i say personally. i know it’s my ed voice.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,10/12/2021-1:50am",lulu601,"Hi lulu601, we’re sorry to hear about these difficult feelings recently.

3,kcporter6,10/13/2021,I don't want to be recovered,"If I were making an objective guess, I'm like 90% completely recovered. I'm doing better than I ever was, but the whole time I've been thinking, ""I'm only eating to make people stop watching, I'll be anorexic again."" I'm so stressed now. I weigh more than I ever have in my life, I don't count calories at all anymore, and most importantly, I can see a little more clearly that my life was actually miserable when I was anorexic. It's so repetitive, ""I was always cold and tired"" and ""everything revolved around food and calories in/out"" but I finally like realized it about my own life. I'm glad I do not have an eating disorder anymore, but I am still dealing with mental illness. It took everything I had and about a year to get over losing my ED, and it was a pretty mild short-lived case, too. I don't have it in me to get over BPD and severe social anxiety, too. I also am graduating with an AA degree soon, so I have to move on with my real life, too, move out, go to college, start a career. It's like I lost everything, and now I have to start again. It's so stressful, and being anorexic was so much easier. It wasn't easy but it was easier, it was simple. I have had minimal support, partially my own fault, and I actually have been pushing forward in ED recovery recently, but like every time I get triggered on social media, or something stressful happens, all I want to do is starve to death. I don't even know where I'm going with this but I guess does anyone else feel like this?",_admin_moderator,"Mon,10/18/2021-10:35pm",Lulu601,"Hi Lulu - you mentioned some concerning feelings in your post and we wanted to make sure you know there are resources if you ever need to reach out for support:

5,Annet,08/20/2021,Thoughts of self-harm (I am safe),"I have been in recovery for 3 years, now. I basically eat normally and exercise for a healthy amount of time. Unfortunately, reducing the time of my workouts has literally increased my anxiety levels to the sky. I know I used to be an elite level athlete and that for years, exercise became my way to let  my anxiety go. Lately, my body just can not cope even with the ""normal exercise time"" for a healthy person. That has been pretty frustrating for me. The problem is that now, there are days when I just can not stop thinking of self-harming. I have NEVER done it and I do not want to get into that terrible habit. Unfortunately, all the things that I try just do not seem to help with my anxiety levels.I see a therapist and a psychiatrist. I had these thoughts in the past but they faded away.
Now, they are back again. I am trying to do all that my therapist told me to avoid having to workout more than the needed. But she does not know I am starting to have self-harm thoughts.I am planning to tell her. But I feel ridiculous just to think of talking about it. At the end, I have not done it. I am not sure if it is just that some time back, I told my pdoc about it and she just did not take it seriously (believe it).My therapist is different. She will surely listen to me. But this is soooo ashaming.
Also, I do not know if I will be able to resist the urges until Tuesday.I am with my family this weekend. So, that will help. But that is where I am right now.Annet",_admin_moderator,"Mon,08/23/2021-1:31pm","Dear kcporter6, since you","Dear kcporter6, since you mentioned having thoughts of self-harm, we would like to share the following resources.

6,pblover,10/19/2021,i don't know how to like myself anymore,"i developed an eating disorder during my first year of college. i became obsessed with losing weight. even though i lost my period, my hands were always purple bc i was so cold, i skipped social events because i didnt want to go over my calories, and i binged whenever i drank, i still loved being skinny. i saw it as an identity, and i placed all of my self worth in my weight. my senior year of college, we were sent home due to covid. then, i binged all the time and stopped tracking calories since i didnt have the pressure of seeing anyone i knew and i assumed i would lose the weight before i went back to school. eventually, i gained back the weight i lost in college, and i started to hate myself. i thought i was a failure and that everyone would think i had glowed down / let myself go. so i hid from all of my friends for a year and tried a bunch of fast methods to lose weight. these diets always failed bc my body was still demanding so much food. now, i have shared my ED story with my friends and apologized for being so distant. i am excited to see them again, but i am so so so nervous. i am no longer partaking in any anorexic behaviors and i'm not underweight, but i still had ED thoughts. i hate looking in the mirror, i hate taking photos of myself, i hide from people i recognize in public, and whenever i see someone i haven't seen since before the pandemic, i just obsess over how they are judging me for gaining weight. i truly dont know how to like myself or gain back the confidence that i had when i was at my skinniest. i feel like hiding forever",_admin_moderator,"Wed,10/20/2021-2:03pm",Welcome! ,"Welcome to the forums Pblover!

8,rykla34,10/17/2021,Bulimia recoverer (struggling BAD),"Hi, this is so hard for me to even let people know that I am a struggler with an eating disorder. Where do I even start?A year and a half ago, I called my mother crying begging her to help me lose weight because I have been bullied for the 7 years before that (since elementary school) about my weight. I had finally hit X bs. I hated myself but it didn’t help that other people let me know they didn’t like how I looked either. Then my ex told all of his friends he was only dating me because I would let him do whatever he wanted, but…I was “too fat” for him to care about cheating on me. So I took it upon myself and my mother’s word to start a diet. That diet lasted 2 weeks.I ended up throwing up every single meal I ever ate. Up until about a month ago, I was fine with dying honestly. I lost so many more friends losing weight than I even had when I had the weight on me. I can’t participate in gym activities anymore, I don’t have the strength. And I can’t play the sport that had my absolute heart growing up. This past year I wasn’t only battling eating disorder, outside of everything going on including the disorder, I was battling with drugs. Now, 2 months and a week sober. And I now suffer with paranoia and anxiety so bad that I can’t go outside and see a group of people without shaking so badly that I don’t even understand why.My own mother tells me how skinny I am. I have gained since then but in pictures I’m so much skinnier than everyone else and I hate it. It’s funny cuz I used to hate being the biggest one and now I hate being the smallest. I am in recovery but struggling. I can keep it in until I look in the mirror and see the extra fat I’ve gained so I relapse. And I haven’t had any help and I don’t want any but I do want advice. As much advice as anyone would like to give. I don’t want to feel full. I hate that feeling. But I do want to gain weight so I can have the strength to gain muscle. It got so bad, i started getting paranoid and started accusing my friends and family of having eating disorders. It hurts a lot but I realized that one of my friends did gain an eating disorder….and that’s my fault for losing that much weight. But I convinced myself that if drugs couldn’t kill me then I will just wait for my disorder to. But that’s enough. I’m so young. My life isn’t the best, but it’s not even close to the worst. I have so much more life to live, I just want to recognize the me in the mirror. I want to live. I want to love myself. I want me and my life back.If you’re a struggler as well I just wanted to let you know that you are NOT alone. You’re so loved and cared for and I’m so proud of you for taking this step as well just to even come on here and read these.

9,Keb93,10/13/2021,Stuck,"HelloFirst time here.I'm about 6 months into recovery, but I'm stuck. Psychologically my relationship with food is worse than ever, but in the sense that I've essentially 'gone off' everything!When I go to the shops I'm on the verge of panic attacks trying to work out what I'm supposed to get to eat. When I do buy myself ingredients or ready meals or components of a meal, by the time I get home I can't think of anything worse to eat. I Google recipes and look on delivery sites but as soon as I see photos of the foods or think about them for too long I start to feel really nauseous.I live with housemates and we're all on conflicting schedules, so I only have myself to rely on to decide what to make and eat, but it's getting more and more debilitating every day, and for snacks, it's even worse. Everything feels like it has too much flavour, it's too strong, or on the opposite hand, it's seems like the blandest dryest thing in the world.At the moment I'm basically living on bread, which is something but leaves me feeling pretty bad mentally and physically at the end of the day.I don't know what I'm supposed to do to, but this needs to stop. It's stressing me out in ways I can't describe and making recovery feel impossible.I'm waiting to begin therapy from the eating disorder team in my local NHS but still have at least 3 months to go.Please help!Thank you x",_admin_moderator,"Sat,10/16/2021-1:44pm",Welcome to the forums ,"​​Hi keb93, welcome to the forums!

10,fr053n,10/07/2021,"New to ‘recovery’ for the first time in years, am I close to being recovered?","Hi everyone, I’m new here and am currently celebrating 100 days binge/purge free! For background, my ED started 14 years ago when I was about 14 years old (wow, that’s half of my life!) I started out copying my sisters habits, who unfortunately suffered from a bad case of anorexia. I initially thought I was just losing the extra weight but it spiraled into a new lifestyle and way of thinking about myself and any interaction with good that I had. I became more reclusive and wouldn’t join others for lunch, dinner, etc. but my ED was more important to me. As I started my senior year of college, I met my first boyfriend, who ensured me that gaining weight would be better for me and that I would look much better. At the time, that and an antidepressant was all it took for me to let go and finally be okay with gaining weight. In just few months of intense binge eating (or maybe this was refeeding), I gained some weight. I couldn’t get enough sugar or carbs and would eat until I was stuffed every day. Fast forward to having a full time job, I found solace in my old eating habits and dropped a lot of the extra weight pretty quickly. I settled into a rather healthy weight for me and my eating fears seem to have calmed down, as I realized how much food it actually took to gain weight. Over the years, as I got more stressed out at my job, I seem to have slipped back into obsessing over extra calories. And this time, it came with the disgusting addition of sometimes purging after I “overdid it” (at the time, I didn’t consider it a binge.) I think it’s interesting how slowly it developed, almost tricking me into thinking I hadn’t changed at all. But it was slow the first time around as well.It took a turn for the worse when I mixed alcohol into the equation and became more concerned about my daily drink(s) than my body weight or appearance. But not entirely. I became what is apparently known as drunkorexic, where I would save my calories for the alcohol I would consume. Because I still wanted to stay thin, no matter how unhealthy. As the drinking become more of an issue, the hinges would happen more frequently, and so would the purges. Eventually, I was bingeing and purging up to 4 times a day and would plan my entire day around eating and where to throw it up. Now it wasn’t a slip up anymore, it was pre-meditated. How did I get here?The alcoholism definitely contributed to the binge purge cycle, but even during times of abstinence I couldn’t quite shake the cycle. It was the only coping mechanism I knew. Everything else seemed out of reach, like I just wouldn’t be able to think about anything else or enjoy anything else. It had fully consumed me.This was my life for the last 2.5 years. Only in the past 100 days have I stopped cold turkey. I haven’t allowed myself to drink in any setting except social settings and have a limit of drinks. I also have not purged a single time. Now, I will say that I have “binged”, or what I would consider a binge in the moment, even when it really wasn’t. (Note: there were times during my ED when I would binge a lot calories) But in the past few years, my anorexic mindset was in full force, so even just the feeling of fullness would trigger an emotional response, leading me to want to purge. I always wanted to feel empty.I guess I would like to know if you guys think I can be considered “recovered” when I still struggle with thoughts of guilt after a heavy meal and the odd urges to purge, although I do not act on them.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,10/08/2021-2:19pm",Hi Fro53n!,"Hi Fro53n!

11,Mustlovedogs,09/26/2021,4 months in and struggling,"I'm a 29 year old female, who's suffered from some form of ED since I was about 12 years ago. I've never had a normal relationship with food or my body. In these last couple of years, I went down a very miserable path of bulimia, restricting in between binges, and also drinking a ton of alcohol. The same day I decided to quit drinking, I also officially decided to start trying to recover from my ED and reclaim my life. I'm almost 4 months in and I feel pretty awful. I constantly have lower abdomen pain, and severe bloating and gas. It feels like I'm allergic to absolutely everything, there's nothing that doesn't set my guts off - but I'm still trying to make sure I don't set any restrictions on what I eat. I am CONSTANTLY exhausted. Next level exhaustion. I sleep for upwards of 10 hours a night, wake up still exhausted, and constantly am nodding off all day - I need constant naps just to get through the day. It's been near impossible to work. My question... is this normal?? Has anyone else experienced these things in recovery? It's hard to sometimes not want to go back to the way it was before. I'm gaining weight consistently, which I know is necessary, but still so hard.. and still feeling physically and mentally awful.

12,catdragonfly,05/11/2020,New here and having a hard time,"Hi everyone. I'm pretty new to these boards. I worked really hard to find what I considered to be real recovery from ednos/osfed (anorexia and bulimia symptoms at various times). It took years and so many relapses and I finally spent a full year (a little over a year) feeling like I had things together! My personality came back, I was spending time with friends, dancing again (in a healthy way) and doing really well at my job. I even entered into an online spiritual training group. Things were great. Then, the pandemic happened. I'm a massage therapist and stressed about my future (I work for a franchise). I'm still expected to attend work meetings virtually until we open back up and my boss makes comments about us gaining weight or the amount of food we’re eating and thinks that it's funny. My coworkers (with the exception of my best friend) are no different in terms of weight jokes right now. That coupled with my dance rehearsals being sporadic and virtual, cancelled performances, feeling completely unable to plan, and looking at the prospect of being sent back to work sooner than expected, I am extremely stressed and a lot of old thoughts are running through my end. I am finding that I have to force myself to eat meals and sometimes it's just too hard. I also purged once and stopped myself another time. What the hell?

I can’t believe I’m actually writing this and that eventually someone is going to see it but I hope that it will help me or others!
I have anorexia for 5 years, struggling everyday. But now I have another problem which drains my energy and makes me feel so so sad and desperate, it’s the binge eating. During my recovery I couldn’t gain any weight but after those 5 years just one day I started to eat and binge eat so fast and unexpected. I don’t know how to stop it, I’ve tried anything anything.  I’m so so so scared. I gained weight and this horrifies me. I know that under binge eating there are major problems but even during my recovery from anorexia I couldn’t understand what it was, I was never depressed, I had friends even boyfriends. I guess I always hated myself and always wanted to be thin, now I want that again but every time when I try to loose weight and stop eat that much I start binging.
Please if someone has been to similar situation and have some advice for me I will appreciate it more that everything!!!!",_admin_moderator,"Fri,09/24/2021-3:56pm",Receive Support ,"Hello everyone, we are glad that you are posting.

15,kyakie,09/14/2021,I'm relapsing. I need help and I don't know where to start.,"Hi all,I got my wisdom teeth extracted about 1 month ago and during that time, I was physically unable to eat. It was painful to open my jaw, which made it nearly impossible to fit food into my mouth. Because of that procedure, I lost weight in just two weeks. Before my surgery, I was in a really healthy place mentally and physically. It's been just over a year since recovery and I hadn't looked back in a long time. Losing weight rapidly and unintentionally feels like the best thing that's ever happened to me, even though I know it shouldn't. I can eat normally now and every time I eat a meal and reach that point of satisfaction, I hate it. I want to lose more weight. I'm constantly in fear of gaining the pounds back and I'm starting to revert back to my old thoughts. I feel the need to walk off the calories from my dinner every night and it's causing me to fall behind in school. I've just started university in a new state which is hours away from home. I'm scared to tell my family about my ED concerns because I know my mom will worry and it'll keep her up at night. I don't have the money to afford professional help without telling them and the last thing I want to do is have that discussion with my family. I feel so trapped right now. I can tell I'm relapsing and I don't know how to stop it.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,09/15/2021-2:20pm",Hi Kyakie!,"Hi Kyakie! Welcome to the forums!

17,ICanDoThis12345,09/08/2021,I've had a slip up,"My recovery from ED has been a bumpy road, but over the last few months I had been doing pretty well. But I recently had a big slip up. I weighed myself and found I had gained some weight over the summer. I know I am not meant to care, but I also know some of this really is from overeating and it got into my head. Anyways, I ended up having four days of purging again.I know I need to stop this immediately so it becomes simply a slip up and not a full blown relapse that I can't shake again. My therapists say a slip up is normal and going through some of our behaviors again is normal and that we want to make sure it doesn't turn to me being in a full eating disorder again day in and day out.I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has gone through this and how you made sure you didn't spiral back out of control?",_admin_moderator,"Wed,09/08/2021-2:12pm",Welcome!,"Hi and welcome to the forums!

20,eviefrye1868,07/13/2021,How do I manage Chronic Pain and ED,"I have been in recovery from an eating disorder for about six or seven months now, however, for most of my life, I have had medical issues and body image issues. In the last four years, I've had a lot of chronic pain. I seem to get into these really bad cycles of pain -> ED -> some sort of depressed/restless episode -> then it may equal out or start again. I am much more aware of it now than I used to be and am able to recognize when it is happening. I'm not really sure what to do though. Part of managing my chronic pain is physical therapy. I would benefit from starting to really do serious working out and revamping my eating, but I am just too scared or when I attempt even a small amount I can feel the obsession start to kick in again. I know the ED makes the pain/depression worse, but the recovery process for the chronic pain makes my ED worse. Does anyone else have this experience? I feel super trapped in this vortex and I am really itching to just ""be better"" because I really think I could be.

26,mavisdrac66,06/29/2021,The Fear of Being Overweight Again,"I thought I’d provide little about my case first. I have never been overweight or underweight. In fact I never knew how much I weighed until I emigrated from my country and arrived here in CA. When I came I was lonely and depressed so I turned to food for comfort, I became overwhelmingly overweight and didn’t care until I was the heaviest one in PE class. I started my “diet” just as Coronavirus pandemic exploded. I started limiting and limiting until I reached almost nothing to eat at all the whole day. My parents and everyone around me started noticing that I was rapidly losing weight but they didn’t try to stop me. I think a part of me stayed consistent with the restriction just to get them to notice how sick and unwell I was. I finally reached my dream weight. But then one day I looked in the mirror and realised that I had no energy to do anything but stay in bed, I lost my sense of life and happiness. That’s when I started considering recovery. I started expanding my intake and eating my fear foods. I remained pretty much the same because I was still in restriction. I later turned to purging for comfort. Then over time as my throat started to hurt I just stopped. I never became underweight though and still no one realised what was wrong. My intake started normalising, and by that I mean to a normal person’s intake. Then I started regaining weight. The fact that I was still at a normal weight but gaining overweight brought me hysteria and anxiety. All I could think of was that I was becoming overweight again. I was never admitted to a hospital or anything but I lost my period and my paediatrician finally mentioned it to my mom “your daughter might be anorexic”. Where I am is starting to be free again. I can’t stop weighing myself though and every time I do, boom, I have gained another pound. I am scared I will turn to restriction again, I don’t want to. I also really need advice on how to stop weighing myself, and if I do, how do I cope with the fact that I might have gained weight and not panic?",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/07/2021-2:54pm",Hi Lulu601,"Hi Lulu601!

27,Aloneinthis,07/07/2021,What I need,"Hi! I am having a difficult time saying what I need. What I need in therapy and just life in general. I am so used to suppressing my feelings in order to make everyone else around me happy. I don’t know how to use my voice to articulate what I need. I recently started going to therapy again. I have been able to open up a little with him about what’s going on, but I have some major life stressors that have pushed me back into eating disordered behaviors. My head knows that EDs do not solve problems and only create more problems. I want to be able to tell my therapist what I need, but I’m embarrassed and ashamed of what I’m doing. I feel like I know better and should be able to do better.At the end of each session, my therapist asks me when he is going to see me again and I give him dates that work for me. This past session, I gave him a date that was two weeks out. I need more than this and I know it. I don’t want to be needy, but I am. After each session with him I am able to quiet the ED voice, but it only lasts a day or two. Then, I’m back to old behaviors. I recently brought out the scale again. I knew it was a bad idea at the beginning, but my therapist didn’t tell me to not weigh myself, so I took it as a green light. I know that was not his intention. I knew it was a bad idea and it’s all on me for bringing it out. I knew where my head was and that the scale was only going to bring up more obsessing about weight and numbers, but I still got it out and stepped on it. I like watching the numbers go down, I like watching my clothes feel more baggy, I like being able to body check. Someone recently said that EDs are my drug of choice and they were right. I don’t like to admit it, but ED is my drug of choice. I like the high I get watching the numbers on the scale go down, I like the high I feel when I am able to restrict. I want to be able to reach out to people in real time in real life about what’s going on, but I’m too ashamed and embarrassed about where I am. I hate all the secrets. I hate lying (and honestly, I suck at it and people see right through the lies). I am scared people will over analyze and will try to push me to eat. Part of me needs this, but I’m not sure I want it. I want to get back to my ED weight and size, but at the same time I don’t want to be in ED hell. I know in my head I can’t have it both ways. It’s either increase my calories or go back to the hell of ED. I’m well on my way there. I’m at a crossroads at the moment and can choose either ED or living a real life. I don’t want this for me and I don’t want my kids to be subjected to the life ED brings. I’m not really sure why I’m posting, but I have so many thoughts and feelings I need to get out and I don’t have anyone I can express them to except for my therapist and I don’t see him for another week.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/07/2021-2:24pm",Considered NEDA resources?,"Hi Aloneinthis, you mentioned wanting to talk to someone in real time, the NEDA helpline and online chat can help you out with that if you like. You can call 800-931- 2237 or chat, https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/helplinechat  to discuss support options.

28,lulu601,07/28/2021,"wanting to relapse, struggling and depression","hi i’m 15 months into my recovery and i believe i’m in the late stages of it because i feel much more comfortable around food, i have a period and my hair loss has completely stopped. however the psychological/emotional symptoms of my anorexia are still present and seem to get worse. i have atypical anorexia and although it was never diagnosed i am 100% sure i do because i have experienced all the symptoms and i completely resonate with it. i tried to get help for my eating disorder and get diagnosed but was denied because i am of a ‘healthy weight’ and i have done most of the recovery work by myself. it’s not the first time i’ve been denied help for my mental health but this time i was completely devastated and felt disgusting. i was so happy about finally receiving help and became a little bit more hopeful about life and recovery. it’s true that i got my period back by myself and i did a lot of the recovery work by myself but i still needed help because i felt very suicidal due to the weight gain and i was still struggling with eating. i cry everyday because of my body and weight gain so it’s clear that i still need help for my eating disorder. i’m always having panic attacks and i’m extremely depressed because of it but the mental health clinic just told me that ‘they didn’t want to make it into a bigger thing than it already is and that i was strong enough to recover by myself’. they also told me to contact them again if i was getting worse but after how they responded to me i don’t think i want to. regardless i’m over that now but i want to relapse because i feel like i don’t deserve to eat or deserve to recover. i’ve already talked about this on neda before but i came across some pro ana accounts on twitter and because of it i hate my body even more and feel like i’m huge and disgusting. i feel even more ashamed of myself and dislike myself even more. seeing how big i am compared to my pre-ed body puts me to shame. i have never been this weight before and it’s terrifying and extremely unfamiliar. i don’t recognise myself anymore and have no confidence at all. i feel extremely insecure and i isolate myself because of it. i don’t go out or try to buy new clothes because of the psychological discomfort. i miss being hungry all the time and i miss being sick. i want to go back to being sick but i will be doing my a levels soon meaning i need to have full energy to study and revise for two years. a levels are big exams that determine what university you will be going to. but because of my eating disorder i have lost interest in going to a good university and don’t have excitement about my future anymore. what’s also stopping me from relapsing is the hair loss. i was always terrified when i would shower because of the huge clumps of hair i’d see fall out. my hair is the only thing i like about myself so i couldn’t bare to see it fall out. i knew i needed to recover. but what shall i do i’m always depressed because of my body and i don’t think i’ll ever return to my pre-ed weight because i still haven’t lost any overshoot. i can’t stand being so huge and i can’t stand my new body. i hate it more than anything. i’m so depressed that i struggle to get out of bed, shower and sleep. i either don’t sleep for over 24 hours sometimes or i sleep too much. i’ve resorted back to self harming again and i keep having suicidal thoughts. my counselling recently stopped but i didn’t feel that my counsellor did much to help me. she would just listen to me talk. i know i need help but i can’t help myself anymore. i can’t bring myself to even call my doctor and book an appointment. whenever i do book appointments i always cancel them last minute because i don’t want anyone to see my body and i don’t have any appropriate clothes to go out. i don’t go out anymore bc of my negative body image and how much i hate my body.my parents can’t even help me because they both don’t believe in eating disorders and they don’t understand mental health issues. other than them i don’t have any other support systems so i’m struggling all alone. my parents are extremely toxic and are the cause of my childhood trauma and most of my mental health issues so i can’t even talk to them about it. i’m scared my friend will judge me if i tell her and i don’t want her to know how i feel either. i feel like i’m a burden and a disappointment. nothing is going right for me at the moment and i’m on the verge of giving up all my recovery even though i worked so hard for it. i hate my recovered body and i know it will probably stay like this forever. i don’t think i’ll ever be able to accept it and seeing how big i am disgusts me and terrifies me. what should i do please give me advice guys. i apologise for all the negativity in what i had to say but it’s truly the way i feel at the moment. i also body check all the time but i haven’t weighed myself in months. unfortunately i saw my weight less than a month ago because of a doctors appointment. i also hate how big my face has gotten and i can see the huge difference compared to my pre-ed body. i know my friends and family have all seen how much weight i’ve gained and i feel so ashamed and embarrassed because of it. i’m always stressed out because of my body and obsessed with fantasising about being thin and skinny. i also want to stop being obsessed with being skinny but i don’t know how to. the uncertainty of whether or not i’ll lose my overshoot weight is also horrible. recovery is so difficult and i’m so angry with my parents for being the main cause of it and my childhood trauma. i used to hate my body before my eating disorder and thought i was huge back then but now i’ve gained so much weight and im so much bigger than how i used to be so you can imagine how distressing it is for me and how much i hate it. i never imagined in my whole life that i would ever be this big or this heavy. like i already said i’ve never been this weight before so it’s horrible for me. as a kid i was always underweight just bc i never had an appetite and growing up i was in the healthy range but now i’m overweight because of recovery and i’m terrified it’ll stay like this forever. i don’t think i’ll be able to cope with being overweight forever and i don’t know what to do because i can’t even try to lose weight or ill be relapsing.if no one replies to this it’s okay because i feel better by venting and letting my feelings out. thanks to anyone who read this far and i’ll be really appreciative if anyone responds. thank you again.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/28/2021-2:42pm",Hi Lulu601,"Hi Lulu601!

I seceded smoking cigarettes almost 11 (eleven) years ago, and continued to ""fill the void"" with binge eating and emotional eating. I gained some weight.

In fact, even at my heaviest, I have always continued to walk outdoors or at the gym.I'm working on dealing with the cravings, and ""saying no"" to overeating.I have already lost some weight, but I have a lot more to go.I am thankful for working on myself, to be a non-smoker, and more recently seceded drinking coffee and decaf coffee for healthier energy/to not sleep late.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/28/2021-2:32pm",Welcome! ,"Hi AnnaS, welcome to the forums!

30,cpeeps,07/24/2021,I could really use some help,"I was inpatient from Dec. 2020 - March 2021 following a long period of restriction. I did partial hospitalization after I was discharged for about a month before stepping down. From about April-May I was doing really well. But since then I've completely fell back in to old habits and no one has seemed to notice (in their defense I've been really sneaky). This time around, I feel like my urges and behaviors are way worse than the first time last year. I've become even more scared of food and I'm really scared of what this is going to do to me if I don't figure out how to help myself because I'm leaving for college in two weeks. I really want to be able to do this on my own because I know it really affected my family to see me suffering last time. But I really don't know what to do. I compulsively exercise which I didn't use to do to and have even more fear foods. I'm at a loss and I feel like I've hit rock bottom. I have no one to turn to because none of my friends really get it, and I don't want to reach out to my friends from treatment because I don't want to affect their recovery. I'm also not currently seeing a dietician because I convinced my mom back in May that I didn't need to see one anymore. I feel like I've really messed everything up for myself and don't know what to do. I don't go out with my friends and spend pretty much every night at home so i can stick to a strict food schedule. Any advice is much appreciated as I really don't want to continue living like this.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,07/26/2021-2:44am",cpeeps,"Hi cpeeps, welcome to the forums. You are worthy of recovery.

33,Aloneinthis,07/13/2021,Scared of therapy,"I have a therapy appointment in a couple days and I’m scared to tell him where my head is. I’ve been discharged for a level of symptomatology that far exceeded the qualifications of an outpatient office (per multiple therapists) and refused to go inpatient (years ago). My old therapist held our sessions as leverage to try to get me to do what he wanted. I’ve recently reread old emails to and from my old therapist. I’m on the fast track to going back right where I was. I’m embarrassed of the communications that took place. I’m also angry and frustrated that I was fired as a patient. I feel like if I could have been able to continue last time, I may have had the tools to not go through this again. I’m scared of being discharged before I gain these tools to be able to get rid of ED. I’m scared of voicing my struggles and I need a safe place to be open. I want to be able to feel safe in communicating where I am, but I’m terrified. At the moment, I have a lot of disordered eating behaviors going on. I’m starting to isolate myself (from family, friends and coworkers) again so I don’t have to be a part of outings that involve food; I’m restricting/fasting; I’ve even purged after several meals lately. I want to be able to talk about all the behaviors I am currently using. I need someone to objectively tell me what I’m doing is causing harm, even though I know this in my head. Lately I have felt accomplished when I’ve been able to restrict and watching the numbers on the scale go down have been rewarding. Again, in my head, I know I should be appalled at the measures I am taking to do this, but I’m not. I’m also scared that if I get rid of the ED then I’ll be obese and not be able to lose weight. My head is jumbled with ED and anti-ED thoughts.

When I was discharged, I was claimed to be at my restored weight. My doctors seemed to think that I needed to continue having some snacks because of school at the time. However, they also said that morning snack was based on timing, so because I woke up early to eat breakfast before school, I needed a morning snack. Now that it is summer, I have been sleeping in a lot more unintentionally, and I have skipped morning snack, but not breakfast, since breakfast is important for everyone to have. I have skipped morning snack usually over the weekend, whenever I sleep in, and when I got weighed, I pretty much maintained the same weight. Now, some days I have a morning snack, but other days, I do not just because of timing. But now, I am worried that I will lose weight and that I will relapse.

38,Recoverfreedom,03/18/2021,Recovering from Anorexia,"Hi everyone!I’m currently in recovering from anorexia; however, I’m afraid I have developed binge eating disorder. I have gained weight within 6 months and I feel disgusted with myself. I’ve been having severe bouts of extreme hunger which will turn into full binges. I have been eating a lot of desert each day in addition to my normal food. Just this past month, I have gained more weight and I really want to go back to my eating disorder of anorexia,
I see old pictures of myself and I just don’t feel like myself anymore. I feel like I’m too fat and none of my clothes fit anymore. I’ve tried to just eat healthy, but every evening and every night, I tend to just binge on sugary foods. I seem to do fine until I start eating dinner. It’s like as soon as I start eating, I can’t stop. I just keep wanting high calorie foods. I, really afraid of gaining any weight. Can anybody relate to what I’m feeling or have any helpful advice?
Also, a lot of my friends are going on diets and it’s very triggering for me. Now that summer is coming around, I’m definitely not ready to go swimming as I have gained so much weight and I would not be comfortable in a bathing suit.

41,luness,04/08/2021,Relapsing - But with Different Symptoms?,"Has anyone else experienced a complete lack of appetite and/or food repulsions in their recovery? I can't find anything about this online!
I began my recovery from anorexia almost three years ago and can acknowledge that I never fully recovered, both in terms of weight restoration as well as healing my relationship with food. When I was in the thick of the ED, I craved almost all foods but heavily restricted because I believed everything was unhealthy. I thought about food all the time and frequently cooked for other people. Now I am much less rigid (I abolished most of my food rules), and I don't feel guilty after I eat. However, I almost never feel like eating. My hunger cues are shot, so that doesn't help.  Picking food, cooking food, eating food and cleaning up after food feels like such a waste of time. Occasionally I will make an elegant meal that I feel excited about only to feel repulsed by it halfway through my plate. Some food smells even make me feel sick (and no, I'm not pregnant). Most of the time, though, it's just me scrolling through dozens of recipes on Pinterest only for nothing to look appetizing in the slightest.
I know I need help.  My husband has to literally coerce me into eating every meal, and it's a source of a lot of tension. But my university counseling center turned me away because I needed ""more specialized care,"" and I'm too broke from paying for grad school to be able to pay for the care I need (assuming I can even can get on the long wait list).",_admin_moderator,"Sat,04/10/2021-11:28am",Welcome!,"Hi luness, Welcome to the forums!

44,imstillgrowing,03/25/2021,The end of dietician sessions and ED Nostalgia,"Hi Recovery Family!It's been so long since I've used this forum. I've been in recovery two years now, which is a huge accomplishment and I'm very proud of myself. But my dietician, who I've been seeing for 3 1/2 years, thinks I'm ready to stop seeing her. I thought I would be excited when this moment came. After all, we've only been seeing each other about once a month for quite some time now. However, I'm feeling fearful and lonely instead of excited. I am pretty solid in my recovery AND I still have a lot of ED nostalgia. There are many nights when I lie awake imagining a relapse. I never thought that two years out I'd still have such pervasive thoughts. I am so thankful that I'm at a space where I can acknowledge these thoughts as just thoughts, and not fall into them. But with the ending of my dietician sessions, I am finding the nostalgia is kicking up a notch, and part of me thinks it's because losing my dietician feels like that--a loss. I know I'm not really losing her, as she says I can always schedule another session if I need it. I think it's also a reminder that I'm not sick anymore. That I don't really fit into the ED community anymore, which was also a loss. Why did no one tell me there would be so much loss in recovery??So I thought I would post here, because I need a little support. I love recovery and all that's it's allowed me to do.

45,barewithme,03/15/2021,What Has Happened To My Body - Metabolism ,"Hi All,I've suffered with an eating disorder for over 10 years, starting when I was 17.
I started restricting my food intake-this lasted for about a year or 2 (I was never extremely underweight)I then developed the habit of chewing and spitting my food out (CHSP) starting this was the worst decision I ever made!
I went on with it for 10 years, never eating meals just snacking , and chewing mounds of food in solidarity.During this period my weight fluctuated a lot, I imagine I was taking in some calories from the chewing, so when I wasn't happy with my weight I restricted the chewing (it feels absurd thinking about it)Anyway, I finally reached a breaking point when I was larger in size and the restricting wasn't helping me lose any weight, I wanted to eat normally and be healthy but happy with my body, so I had my resting metabolic rate tested at a university in London.
The results were shocking, my predicted RMR was Xkcal but my actual RMR came back at Xkcal.I was told they had never seen such a low RMR in anyone of my healthy weight (healthy, but in reality I wasn't healthy at all)
How was my body a healthy weight when I wasn't ingesting any meals? And at that point I was chsp on some food.I decided to turn things around and began eating meals along with lifting weights, initially I thought I was putting on weight, but I was reassured but a DR in Australia who specialised in ED and was looking into CHSP, that this was just water weight from what I was taking on. Eventually things levelled out and I dropped the pounds and gained more muscle and I was happy with myself! Even though I lost a couple of pounds I was still a healthy weight (I've never wanted to be incredibly skinny) the only problem was I still wasn't eating enough, I was consuming the amount of calories people would when dieting, or less. Eventually my muscle gains plateaued and slowly the weight crept back on. This was roughly 2 years ago and I'm not entirely sure why - maybe my body got use the the amount of calories, so I  should have continued increasing them.I now eat maybe a little bit more than then, but it is still a considerably low amount of calories yet I am not happy with my weight. I am not over weight and have a normal BMI. I just want to be able to eat a normal amount without gaining even more weight, but I'm scared to.I imagine my metabolism is to blame for this, or for some reason my body is holding onto the fat and not wanting to burn it? (Now I am heavier my recent test showed my RMR is Xkcal)I just can't understand how I am the size when I still don't eat enough. Has anyone else experienced this?Would appreciated any replies and stories if anyone would like to share.

47,survivingtothriving,01/27/2021,Recovering when I was never medically underweight,"Hey y’all! I guess I just wanted to let off some stuff about this. I’ve recently started recovery and I’m really struggling with the fact that recovery doesn’t always have to mean weight restoration. I feel like every other anorexia/restrictive eating survivor had to go through this long, intense battle of gaining weight back, and although I do have serious medical issues from losing weight and I am at a low weight for my height, I’m not medically unstable enough to warrant having to regain a lot of weight. I think this is because I’m a fairly tall girl (5’7”) and also naturally have a pretty muscular frame, so I don’t lose weight all that easily and I’m just pretty sturdy naturally. It makes me feel really bad because I want recovery, but I feel like I don’t deserve to eat normal amounts as my frame is naturally bigger and I’m not visibly or medically considered underweight. I also feel like people see the whole “naturally bigger frame” thing as an excuse, and I just feel so invalidated in my struggles because I don’t fit the stereotypical image of my disorder. I know recovery looks different for everybody, and everyone’s set point weight is different, but it just hurts knowing that people think I look fine now when I’m not, and that I likely won’t fit the beauty standard when I get back to a healthy weight for me. Urgh. Anyone else with a more muscular/bigger build and AN relate to this? What helped you during recovery? Any words of wisdom or support?

I am looking for an online recovery buddy to support each other and keep each other accountable (like messaging every day and during crisis situations).
A bit about me: female in my late twenties, had an earting disorder for over 10 years, last 3 years in treatment and (more or less) recovery. Have been relapsing recently due to all the pandemic pressure and the fact that I think I was in ""pseudo-recovery"" before. This time I want to commit to full recovery without any ""safe thoughts"",  which probably means gaining weight and scares me.
Anyway, please message if you are also recovering and would like to be in touch to help each other!

I've had no triggers or behaviors for about 5 months now. I do not have a theripast as we completed in October progress wise. :) My psychiatrist had even commented on my progress saying I was doing well recently, I was happy.It was all going well until about a week ago, I've suddenly lost my appetite for anything. I'm not pregnant (100% like period 2 days ago %) and I've had no recent change in plans or expectations. Now I've always had a hard time being hungry but I usually can snack and make myself meals to keep myself in check. As of recently though, I lack the motivation to even find the appeal in some simple foods.
I had tried talking to my boyfriend (I live by myself currently and hes been a great support, since I've been diagnosed and gotten treatment, relapses etc. (Since 15, OSFED, only done therapy) and he said I should try to eat something at least and confirmed the fact that I should be hungry. But somehow I can't even stomach things. I tried to eat some baked goods I made and I had a little bit but I just didn't want anymore. I feel kind of frustrated because I know I should he hungry, my body is hungry, but part of me is starting to go ""well you're not physically or mentally hungry.. so why eat?"" Which is the mindset that my eating disorder stems from but it feels logical! I'm not even weighing myself. I don't feel fat either.

52,Rhath,02/05/2021,Slipping and just not hungry,"I started therapy for restrictive eating after decades of skirting around the issue and it finally got really bad. I was doing great the first 4 months with sticking to my meal plan and getting more comfortable with adding a little weight, though still not thrilled. Then I hit the wall and just don't feel the same motivation as I did at the beginning of recovery. I have slowly been slipping into less eating and now this week I am really having to force myself. It is extra difficult right now because my 14 year old son has ulcerative colitis and we have to be at Children's Hospital for 3+ days. It is so hard to find things I want to eat here and my anxiety just has my stomach in knots so eating really doesn't feel good.

54,ariel0115,02/02/2021,Weight gain/inability to lose weight post recovery,"Hi! I am in 'recovery' from restrictive eating habits and intense exercising although I have never formally been diagnosed with an ED. I started becoming uber conscious of food and restrictive around age 15 and went through periods where I was really restrictive versus more 'normal' healthier periods. Shortly after I started becoming more conscious of my food choices (at 15) I lost my period until age 19. Age 19-21 I gained X lbs despite still eating fairly little and exercising. Halfway through being 21 I stopped restricting, have been seeing a nutritionist and am following her caloric target which is above what i used to eat, but is still a 'losing weight' target for someone of my height. Since being 19 (for 3 yrs now) I have been completely unable to lose weight and seem to keep gaining weight. During the last few months I have tried to trust the process and keep hoping my metabolism will sort itself out from the restriction, but its already been almost 6 months and I am stil gaining weight. I am well above a healthy weight/above my pre-ed weight.

55,mila123,01/30/2021,Is overeating a part of the recovery or is that still a part of my eating disorder?,"Hey everyone, I started my recovery around this time last year. I have gotten so far with my recovery, I feel much better, I can focus on my life, my weight and what I eat doesn't bother me anymore. A little background on my eating disorder, I was an anorexic when it started, but after two years, as I was losing weight, I got hungrier and hungrier, and so I became a binger, I would binge on a few different foods and in that period I became a bulimic, and things got out of control. I was stuck in that cycle for so long, and I decided to finally seek recovery. I was on antidepressants and all  that things, and so I feel much better. I have one thing that still reminds me of that part of my life, which is why I'm writing. Since my recovery, I don't control myself over what I eat, but once a week since I started recovery, I overeat. It used to be really big quantities of food, but now I'd say it's just the size of one extra meal. The eating itself doesn't bother me, but what bothers me is that I'm tying this habit to my past bingeing and purging, like a leftover of that habit. The thing is I can even recall of this habit even before my eating disorder, it is what brought me to my eating disorder, because I was aware of this behaviour but I didn't know hot change it, I was around 13 when I remember it first started happening. So my question is, is this a normal part of the recovery, or should I try and fix my habits?",_admin_moderator,"Sat,01/30/2021-10:47am",Welcome!,"Hi mila123, Welcome to the forums!

57,zofia,01/09/2021,Relapsing,"Hello, I'm new to the forum. I'm sorry for how long this post is going to be... I'm 19 and I've considered myself to be recovered for about a year. My eating disorder didn't last very long, because I quickly received help (therapy and small dose antidepressant medication), but it was still quite intense and very damaging for me. I started to starve myself when I was 16/17, which was partly a coping mechanism for my feelings of horrible loneliness and self-hatred, partly a suicide attempt, and it quickly became an eating disorder. My life turned around completely after I started going to therapy and taking meds and after I managed to make friends. I gained A LOT of weight over the summer last year, compensating for all the kilograms that I've lost, but I dealt with it quite well,though I still took my medication and went to therapy for another year. I stopped doing both of these things around September this year, because, despite the covid situation, I was feeling well. I was also excited because of the start of my first year at university. Unfortunately, lately things have seemed to be going downhill. I've been struggling to find any motivation that I need to actually study - because of that I feel as if I hadn't learned anything and continuing to try seems pointless sometimes. I don't even know why I chose this particular major anymore, all I have to learn seems worthless to me now. On some days I feel overwhelmed by feelings of hopelessness and then I might struggle to get out of bed, take care of myself, let alone study. And obviously, with the pandemic and usual lack of time, I rarely see any of my friends. I chat with some of them and try to keep in touch, but lately I've become growingly disgusted with myself, which makes me feel like I should stop bothering other people and cut ties with them. I've already had a time latelt when I deleted my social media for around a week and did not contact with anyone, but, obviously it just makes me feel worse. That's obviously when the ed comes in. I've been feeling worse and worse about myself for a few months now, but I think it became even worse around a month ago and some of my old habits seem to be coming back. As it was two years ago, it started with several days of fasting and these were the days when I didn't feel motivated enough for anything. From time to time there were days when I had sudden surge of energy or motivation, but most of the time everything seems to be painfully chaotic, unorganized, it seems like I'm not doing anything to change it and I know that I'm just so awfully pathetic and disgusting. I've started to restrict again, though I wasn't as successful in it as I wanted to be. Eight after Christmas I was left alone at home after my family went away for a week or two and once again I was using restriction and fasting as a way of punishing myself, creating order  in my life or something. I'm starting to feel like I'm not able to keep going without heavily restricting, though i think it's different from what it used to be. I only wanted to do this for a day or two, maybe more, and then it would be over, but I'm not any less angry at myself. I've binged multiple times over these days and it makes me even more angry at myself. It makes me want to restrict even more, even though I am aware, that hunger is the reason for binging. But I started to feel discomfort after eating anything, like something is not right, and something is telling me that maybe this is the only way to make things right and to make life livable. I'm so angry at myself most of the days, but this seems like compensating for everything that I do incorrectly and all the ways in which I am incorrect. I don't want to relapse though. I don't want to lose as much weight as I did two years ago - I feel worse about my weight than I did a few months ago, but I don't want to destroy my body like this again and most of all I don't want anyone to worry about me. This is the main reason why I'm concerned about this, really, that I don't want to upset other people. I not that my grandparents would be horrified if this happened. I'm also worried about my sister. She has been the first person to notice anything two years ago and yesterday she accidently saw my notebook with all my meals and calories written down. She didn't tell anyone else, but she got very angry at me. I obviously told her that it only happened for a few days,but I'm okay. I don't know though. After I talked to her I felt like I really need to start eating normally and regularly again, but right after that all the thoughts that I had had before came right back to. I don't know if I'm going to bear all of this without having some form of restriction. I don't know why, but it's hard for me to convince myself otherwise. Nothing happens z really, but that just makes it seem worse. Days just pass and I don't even notice. Everything seems so chaotic and I can't make anything right. My friend has recently suggested that I could go back to therapy, but I don't think it's a good idea. I don't think it is going to help me in any way right now, my parents will have to pay for it again (I don't have a job yet, I intended to get one, but I'm already not able to deal with my upcoming exams and probably too dumb even for my worthless major). And as I said, I haven't even lost weight and I keep eating too much in the end. Whenever I try to talk to someone, I realize that everyone is struggling,especially now, during the pandemic. It makes me feel like I don't need any more help than others do. I might feel better tomorrow or several days from now. Sometimes I end up convincing myself that I only do everything for attention and I deserve to beat myself up for it. Again, I'm sorry for making this overly long. I guess I just needed to get some things of my chest, but maybe I should've kept it shorter.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,01/10/2021-11:58pm",zofia,"Hi zofia, welcome to the forums.

I think. I've gained some weight. I do body-weight exercises and I'm a very serious athlete, so I'm also not as strong as I used to be. Plus I'm taking a little time off for the holidays, or not pushing as hard, or something. Which is good... but yeah :(I've had anorexia, I went to the hospital, my parents know about that. Now I've been trying to not eat, because I'm not hungry or to purge after binging, and they say stuff like, ""Should we be worried this is the anorexia again? No, wait, you're clearly not underweight so it's not a problem.""Needless to say this is not a helpful statement. I know EDs happen in all bodies, I know. I miss being anorexic, though, because it was a)obvious to other people that there was a problem and b)felt better -- that was control, this is just fat and out of control and stuff like that. I haven't actually purged, like thrown up yet. But I really want to, sometimes -- it would make some things easier. I get close, and then I don't because I know how bad that is for you medically.But I think binging and having too many calories is bad too. I can't restrict anymore, I don't know why. My body won't let me go back to having bad anorexia, which I guess is a good thing but maybe not. I can't even really overexercise right now, so it feels like purging is the only way out.

59,MeowMeow,12/30/2020,severe anemia 5 years into recovery,"Hey everyone,I'm new here.  I struggled with anorexia all through my teenage years.  For the past 5 years I have been weight-restored and behavior free.  I have never received professional help.Due to some complications, I went 3 years without seeing a doctor.  But just last year I got a physical and was due for blood work.  They found that I was severely anemic and sent me to the emergency room, where they decided I was stable enough not to require a blood transfusion and instead prescribed me iron supplements.  Within a week after I started taking the pills, I noticed a HUGE energy difference.  And after a couple months, I noticed that my hair was growing in much darker, thicker, and curlier (the old hair looked almost blond and the new hair was brown).My doctor ordered a bunch of tests to try to figure out the cause of the anemia (looking for various sources of internal bleeding) and all came back negative.  After describing my periods to her, she said they didn't seem heavy enough to explain such severe anemia.I am wondering if the anemia was caused by my ED history.  It just feels strange that such a severe mineral defficiency could still happen after eating normally for several years.

60,taupelle,12/19/2020,"Anxiety over meal planning, causing family arguments ","Hey all! So I struggle with finding recipes and making meal plans. I’ve had my eating disorder for so long that I honestly have no idea what foods I enjoy and have a hard time figuring out if I don’t like a food or if it’s my eating disorder that doesn’t like it. This causes a lot of trouble in finding recipes because I have absolutely no idea what to look for. My dietician suggested making meal plans with my mother, since I live at home and we cook dinners together. I was a little worried about the idea because my mom and me used to get into huge arguments over what I wanted to eat and it’d usually result in her storming out of the room telling me to just not eat anything. Today I finally worked up the courage to ask my mom if she’d make a meal plan with me. She got a little annoyed but said fine. While we were looking for recipes she was clearly annoyed and sighing a lot. Every time I told her that a recipe didn’t sound good she’d roll her eyes and get loud. It was obvious I was annoying her and I was starting to panic a little. Finding recipes is already hard as it is and she was making it even harder. After me declining a couple of recipes she got annoyed and slammed the recipe book closed. She told me she would just find the recipes on her own. I explained to her that I needed to be apart of finding the recipes for my recovery; plus we have very different tastes in what we like to eat so I knew I probably wouldn’t enjoy her recipes. She continued to get annoyed and it led to an argument. Instead of arguing back I started to have a panic attack and cry, I was going to walk away and go to my room. But she got mad and started yelling at me to come back. I explained to her that this was already something that’s super hard for me to do and I asked her for help in hopes that it would be easier. She said fine and we continued to find recipes together. We just finished our meal plan a little bit ago. I could tell my mom was upset with me so I apologized for having a panic attack, she said it’s fine and went outside to smoke. I’m kind of annoyed because I really don’t feel like I was in the wrong here. I tried my best to remain calm with her and not raise my voice despite having a panic attack, but she continued to push me. She couldn’t even be bothered to apologize to me for yelling and acting like a child. I’m sorry if that sounds rude but I’m just super annoyed right now. I don’t have a lot of support in my recovery and my mom is really the only person I can rely on right now. From now on I’ll probably just make the meal plans on my own, because it’s honestly less stressful that way. If anyone has any advice on how they manage to find recipes they like I’d really appreciate it!!

64,yoyokay,11/30/2020,AN Recovery Turning into Purging and other Update,"I have been getting my weight back to normal after being dangerously low due to my anorexia. Now, I am at a normal weight but still really mentally messed up. One issue I am noticing is that because I still feel inclined to restrict to lose weight, my brain is feeling like I need to ""stock up"" and really eat now before I restrict again. Like my mind is arguing between eating a bunch and starving, ""You better enjoy eating now, then you'll go back to undereating again to get skinner"" Anyway, because of this I have over eaten on unhealthy foods lately (not sure if enough to be a ""binge"" but, definitely consistently overeating) and because I am already at a normal weight, I feel really badly about it afterwards and think about how my body will change from eating so poorly and not restricting like I used to. Because of this, I have been making myself throw up. I was alone on Thanksgiving because I couldn't see my family. I binged and purged a couple of times that day. Bingeing was never an issue for me throughout my anorexia but now it is like because I am trying to give myself permission to eat normally, my brain is overly excited and wanting to eat everything that sounds tasty because it's afraid I am going to be really strict and eat tiny amounts of food again. I feel like I am emotionally eating a lot as well, eating for comfort because other things are so bad right now. I have had a rocky relationship that negatively impacted my mental health but we are doing okay right now. My bf recently moved into an apartment with someone he did not know beforehand. He seemed like an okay guy and we were all hanging out this weekend. Well, my bf went to the store and his roommate and I stayed behind because he was sketching a tattoo design for my leg. While my bf was gone, he sexually assaulted me. I don't know what to do or if I should tell my boyfriend. My bf used to call me bad names and be paranoid and jealous last year and earlier this year, so I am not sure if telling him would be good or not. I got blood drawn for an STD check and plan B today because I am really nervous he could have given me a disease. I have been distracted all day and sick feeling. I couldn't sleep and stop thinking about what he did. I am so overwhelmed and it feels like my life is just one terrible event or situation after another. Big, emotional, traumatic situations like this are making my ED harder to cope with.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,11/30/2020-9:01pm",RAINN Resource,"Hi there, Yoyokay - we are so sorry to hear of what you've been through.

I didn’t binge or purge but I definitely ate different types and more food than usual. Last night I started feeling chest pain and it hasn’t gone away this morning and is making me worry. I feel like I don’t swallow food normally and it still comes up my throat even though l don’t do anything to induce it. Maybe it’s just the pandemic and increased existential panic, but these health issues, even if they are minor, are giving me a lot of anxiety.

i have gained some weight,my body is changing,becoming softer,and i must admit i miss all my old sharp angles.i felt much safer,smaller,sharper.
i have often been saying to my pyschiatrist that i so want to go back to my old life.He keeps reminding me of how unhappy i was then.i have not found contentment in recovery yet,but maybe that is because it is so early yet,and i am still struggling.Anyway.
i had lost my period to anorexia for over two years and the other day it showed up.i did not know how to feel.i know how i should feel.

69,grace7879,11/05/2020,Lack of Concentration + Having No Control ,"Hi :)
This is my 6th week in my Anorexia recovery. The first week was obviously hard, but it gradually got better until around the 4th-week mark. I lost weight in one of my clinic's check-ups, but this was purely due to the fact my body was ready for an increase in energy consumption. But thanks to this, it almost gave my brain the opportunity to convince me that I NEEDED to then lose more weight. Due to this, it led to me compensating for weight gain by X and lying to family about what I was eating.
Now I'm in a really bad position and being told that hospitalization is on the table if I don't get my act up. I do, all I really want to do is just get better, I want to be normal again and get Anorexia out of my life for good. But I now feel like I have a ""permanent reflex"" when it comes to X. I just don't feel I have any control over it at all. Whenever there's a split second I'm alone with food, literally 10 seconds, I have gotten up and X without even thinking about it. And if I don't get to X I feel incredibly guilty.Another thing is I cannot concentrate to save my life. I know when your malnourished you do struggle to concentrate but it's not like I'm not eating anything. I still have my 3 meals and 1-2 snacks a day so I'm defiantly fueled but I just cannot get myself to focus on anything other than food and mealtimes. It leads me to get even more stress out as I'm lacking on my school work, which then adds ANOTHER layer of stress as I'm currently not in school due to my ED. If anyone has any kind of tips it would be so much appreciated!",_admin_moderator,"Fri,11/06/2020-3:44pm",Dear grace7879,"Welcome to the forums!

I couldn’t say I’m “fully recovered” but I’ve been in a decent place for a while, maintaining a safe weight and on the whole able to live a full and enjoyable life. Although certain food/body-related worries are usually in the background, they don’t dominate anywhere near to the level they have done in the past.
But even now I still have those days (today) where I just feel so fat, ugly and I can’t identify any of the deeper roots/anxieties. The self-disgust becomes my reality, no matter how much therapy I’ve had recently or over the years.
It doesn’t impact my behaviour, but the low mood is pretty dark and lonely. Talking about it with family/friends usually results in an argument; they’ve heard it all before and have run out of things to tell me. Therefore I tend to keep it to myself these days.

78,BeeTrying,10/12/2020,Feeling Stuck (OSFED),"At around November 2019 I made the decision to try for recovery. My initial reasoning behind that decision was not the healthiest,but overall I was tired of the disordered cycle. I fought to receive help and in January (?) I got a therapist who specializes in eating disorders, and then in March I fought for a dietician. I say fought because my family hardly understands my issues, but I am not going into that today.The first four months of recovery was slow but very progressive. I was using an ED app that connects with your dietician, striving for x balanced meals, and really focusing on my mental health and hunger cues. But slowly I became more overwhelmed and drifted away from my recovery. I did not relapse, but I was in no way really progressing or even trying. This obviously affected many aspects of my life, including my eating patterns. So, it is going on four months of this limbo and I have become very frustrated. In the beginning, the pause in my recovery was beneficial as I was dealing with other factors of my mental health, but now they are in the works I feel the desire to continue with recovery but,,, I do not feel as motivated. I need intensive treatment but I am only seeing my therapist and dietician (alternating weeks) for one hour each week. One hour of support. I am grateful for them but at the same time that feeling of support vanishes quickly through the next 6-9 days. I feel lost. I feel like I am doing this completely myself. It is so hard to do this all my own while tackling other responsibilities: my job, school work, college applications, other aspects of my mental health, and more. I discussed this with my therapist and she recommended a treatment center and I quickly applied. They gave me a call and with that I got a feeling the center is mainly catered to those just starting recovery or trying to. I'm almost 8 months into recovery and my mindset has changed drastically. So, even if they try to provide me a treatment plan it may not be beneficial (plus the place is an hour away and they mentioned me having to do 9 hours of group a week). Physical affects of my limbo has been the decrease in meals. I am not intentionally skipping meals, however, I believe the stress, frustration, and my chaotic eating patterns have a big part of my appetite. I worry how I may be harming my body but I also feel very hopeless in my recovery. This led to lots of stomach pains, especially when I eat after a long time, but even with that I cannot find the strength to help myself. I type this all out simply because I feel very alone in this. I have very little support and I feel like I am never going to recover.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,10/12/2020-10:14pm",Welcome! ,"Hi, thank you for posting.

82,citrusfriend,08/01/2020,Possible health issues bc of ED,"(Tw: mention of previous suicide attempt via starvation, covid, physical problems caused by ED, relapsing, and police brutality) So I've been dealing with disordered eating since I was 8 and sporadically restricted enough for it to be an actual disorder. Two years ago, though, it got bad. Like, lose-a-lot-of-weight-going-bald-sleeping-too-much kind of bad. The Bad Period lasted about 8 months, but I've had small relapses (lasted a couple weeks at most) since then. I see a therapist every week, but I rarely talk to him about my ED. I've never been to a dietitian or doctor or anything for it. But ever since I started my recovery after those Bad 8 Months, I've been having issues with my digestive system. At the very beginning, I would puke and get diarrhea often. That petered off after 3 months or so, but I still have issues with my digestive system and bouts of extreme pain. I feel like the pain has been getting worse, and want to go to the doctor, but bc my last doctor was an awful person, I need to get a new one. And now, with the pandemic and impending American civil war, I'm stressed and the urge to restrict is getting worse and worse. Any time I accidentally miss a meal time, I find myself not eating for the rest of the day. I still feel hunger, which is good, but nothing looks or tastes good anymore. How do I even explain this to a doctor so she'll understand? I don't want a dietitian; I feel like it would be counterproductive for me. The Bad Period was caused by someone briefly trying to control my diet and me reacting disproportionately to it. I think I would have a similar reaction to a dietitian. But maybe that's the ED talking, idk. I just want the doctor to fix the fucking pain. I just want the doctor to tell me that I didn't destroy myself. I'm so afraid of everything constantly bc of the pandemic, bc of the political climate. Tanks rolled down the street next to my work today. I'm so terrified and I'm tired of being terrified that I'm dying bc of what I've done to my body, but I'm also terrified that I'll go through my trauma-induced fear of doctors, only to be told that I can't be trusted with my diet either. I think I'm afraid a doctor will take away my choice and right now I feel like a lot of my choices have been stolen already. I don't trust doctors, I can't. Idk. I'm so tired and I'm so scared. When my eating disorder was bad two years ago, it only got so bad bc it quickly became a way to hurt myself. It was just an 8 long month suicide attempt. And now that I've finally learned to want to live, everything is trying to kill me. Covid could kill me. Cops could kill me. Feds could kill me. My partner goes to the protests and if she dies there, that would kill me. And I'm so terrified that I've killed me too, that my desperate attempt two years ago is a time-delayed success. I don't want the doctor to give me a dietitian to fix me, but I think I'm more terrified that they wont be able to fix me at all. I know I'm probably overreacting. I don't actually think this will kill me, which is why I haven't gone to the doctor before now. But now, I'm so goddamn scared of everything that I can't stop catastrophizing bc with covid and the police, my worst fears turned out to be underestimations of what our reality would become. And even if this doesn't kill me, what if there's still permanent damage? I'm schrodinger's ailment and I'm afraid of finding out what's there. I can't take being told this pain will last forever. I can't take being told I'm going to die. I'm not strong enough for that, not anymore, but I'm not strong enough for this limbo to last forever either.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,08/02/2020-10:01am",RE,"Hi citrusfriend, We’re glad that you reached out to the forums and we hope you find all the support that you are looking for here.

84,marierecovers44,09/18/2020,my mom is stopping my recovery,"guys please help me this is really bringing me down. I'm 14, female btw.
I suffered from a very restrictive mindset when it came to food (obsessive calorie counting, weighing X a day, losing too much weight..) I developed this ED in quarantine and a few months ago I started my recovery journey. I'm still in the middle of it but I stopped counting, weighing myself and forcing myself to work out. no, I have not gotten rid of all the bad thoughts and no, I'm still not perfectly happy with myself and no, I cannot always eat everything and not feel bad. But I'm not done yet and I have worse days and better days which is perfectly normal. The thing is, my mom really contributes to the disordered thoughts because she has them herself but she doesn't admit it.
Her daily calorie intake is probably about X a day which is not enough.
when I want to cook for her, there's always some comment like ""is it full fat?"" ""how much X did you use?"" ""could we have less of that and rather have a X on the side?""
or when I wanted to make breakfast for us in the morning: ""I don't like having so many X for breakfast""
also, typical phrases:
""I feel like a whale"" (then she eats even less)
""oopsie, might have not eaten enough today""
""I'm not a sweets, baked goods person"" (I know she likes them)
and she orders X at restaurants, rarely has desserts or shares them, only eats tiny portions at events and the list goes on. she also doesn't want me to bake anything because she ""can't restrain herself it it's there"".
a few days ago we were in the car for a 5h ride, she'd eaten X. says she's hungry, eats X. like, how am I supposed to feel good about my eating habits when she eats half of what I eat and constantly complains about how much she overeats or her weight.
and yes, I've talked to her about it many times but she just says that she needs less and that it's none of my business.
The thing is, she always tells me EXACTLY what and how much she's had that day (kind of disordered) even if I tell her to stop and she gets super annoyed and mad when I tell her to eat more.

85,Lilyj,09/12/2020,Do I have an Ed??,I want to start by saying that I didn’t know what category to put this in. I don’t want to trigger anyone so please don’t read this if you are not comfortable with it. I don’t know if I have an eating disorder or not and I don’t know who else to ask. Here is my story: it started off with just wanting to lose some weight and be healthier even tho I was already at a healthy weight. I started restricting and trying to measure and count all my calories as much as I could. In the beginning there were nights when I would fall asleep thinking about what I was going to eat the next day. I would also exercise frequently but not excessively. Then it moved to puking up my food when I ate too much( small binges) but it was hard so I stopped. Lately I’ve been in a cycle where I eat healthy(sorta restrict but not really) for a couple days and then binge. I’ve binged the last 3 nights and tonight I puked up a small amount. I eat with my family because I really do love food so I can never go long with super healthy eating. I’ve been binging a lot lately but i want so badly to be skinny. It’s not obsessive but once I start binging it’s like I can’t stop. Then the next day I  restrict  and then binge. I’ve read about Ed’s online and it’s like I have a small amount of every disorder. But I also feel like I don’t have one and I’m just being unhealthy.

89,2Healthy4me,09/01/2020,Carpel Tunnel on Left Thumb is Painful and(tiny bit o rant),"It's a constant reminder of my past 2 exhausting jobs when combined together. I hate to say this but the break I had to take, due to Covid, was a saving grace for me. I had been suffering from from my carpel in left hand from a long term assignment where the students would leave a mess of books on the floor by the end of every 6th period class. The other 2nd job in retail made my carpel even worse in having to re-hang, collect clothing repeatedly from the store floors, and also dressing room duty just made my carpel even worse. Then from exhaustion b4 CV-19 break I kind of missed the wall and fell on my buttocks instead w/ my bad left hand saving my back. All these combined led to my near work exhaustion. The last few months i had worked i had also earned the most money and also had felt the most exhausted ever. So with the CV-19 break and in finding a new 2nd job and not teaching onsite just yet; in this spare time i have been able to breath in, and breath out, and take the time to thank God that I am still standing strong. In spite of my ""Shortfalls"" I am still a CV free person... My new job has me taking breaks every 2.5 hrs and so I am eating more regularly, have time to walk in between work shifts, on my days off. I also have improved my home ec skills for stove top cooking. I am more aware of the types of food which i put into my shopping cart as i walk home w/ 2 arms of groceries 2x a week. I can only carry so much w/ my lame left hand, and my neck and back issues as well. for the pain I'm in.

92,grievingpianist,09/07/2020,Weight restoration and severe emotional stress,"Hi everyone,I guess you could say I'm an anomaly. I'm 71 years old, and I've suffered with anorexia for about six decades. I relapsed because I was so triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. I simply felt too out of control, and I didn't realize that I was losing weight.Now, at the order of my medical team, I am tasked with the really difficult work of weight restoration. I remember it being very, very hard (11 years ago I spent six weeks in an eating disorder residential program, and many years ago I was hospitalized numerous times.)This time, I'm doing it solo with a lot of medical guidance. This being a holiday weekend, I'm completely by myself. I'm so frightened. I can't stop shaking, can't control my thoughts, and when my stomach hurts from constipation I really, really can't make myself eat — although I'm supposed to do that no matter what.I'm in a program somewhat like AA, but it's not a place where I can really talk about this (the focus is entirely different, and it wouldn't be appropriate). I'm going to an eating disorders anonymous meeting on Zoom later today. I'm praying that it is still in existence.Too many people, especially my boyfriend and some of the meeting folks I talk with by phone -- respond by wanting to ""fix"" this — suggesting foods I might try, suggestions like ""just eat more"". They mean well. But as most of you probably know it's not something you go out and fix by tinkering with the way you would a car that isn't running right. It's so much more spiritual. It's so much more all-encompassing and vague.I'm so grateful that this form is here. I never thought I would need it again (I really believed I was done with relapses).

100,horseshoecrab,08/25/2020,college meal plans and old fears,"I just moved onto the college campus as a fresham (which is exciting!) but the meal plam situation is messing me up. It's only open certain hours and I have to order meals off the menu, so I went grocery shopping instead so I could have some things in my room. Problem is now there's food all the time, and somehow it's worse than when I was at home with everyone else there and my own food-free room and everything. I've been binging and gaining weight, and I thought I was just settling in, but it's been a week now and nothing has changed so I'm scared it's going to be more permanant.I'm scared that binging is killing me. I'm not as overfull as I used to be but it's still bad, plus I know this kind of food is bad for you in the long run. I had an arrythmia associated with low weight/stress that has been persistent -- I checked it with the doctor last year and he says it's probably still just stress. Still it's worse when I've been binging, and I know it's probably just that that's when I'm stressed out, but regardless I hate that correlation. I have a single room, and I'm afraid that if something went wrong with my heart no one would be there to notice or help me.I know I'll probably get over the binging when classes really get going and that the heart arrythmia is normal, but I'm still in a kind of adjusting limbo and it's scary. I'm afraid of never losing the weight (frehsman 15!) and I'm afraid of dying. I'm such a slob when I'm binging, and I hate hate hate the image of me all alone in my messy dorm room stuffing myself overfull of crap.I just wanted somewhere to write this, I guess.

102,Lissafort,08/14/2020,Digestive issues with anorexia nervosa ,"Hi friends! I’m new here and I’ve been in recovery for anorexia nervosa for almost 2 months. I’m working with a dietician and a therapist as well as have a support system of friends and family by my side, but something I can’t seem to get a diagnosis on yet are all of my digestive issues.
I’m constantly uncomfortable, all the time. Every food I eat makes me gassy, bloated, uncomfortable, and usually get acid reflux. Sometimes I get nauseous and anxious and feel “full,” but I’ve never pushed myself to the feeling of fullness. I’m afraid of that feeling still. Nothing ever sits quite right in my stomach, if you know what I mean. I eat more on some days than I do on other days but I still just always feel sick. My head hurts and feels foggy, I feel weak, tired, cranky, and my stomach is always uncomfortable. Before I knew I had an eating disorder, I was diagnosed with IBS-C and was given a medication to help with constipation. Now, I have diarrhea pretty much all day, everyday and it’s miserable. I can’t get it to stop. And no matter how much water I drink, I still feel thirsty. I drink a lot of water a day because that’s just how thirsty I am. Is all of this normal? Does anybody have any tips for any of this?",_admin_moderator,"Sat,08/15/2020-2:26pm",Welcome!,"Hi Lissafort, welcome to the forums, we are glad you are here!

113,Annet,07/19/2020,Feeling quite dissapointed,"Hi everyone, I recently had an appointment with my therapist and at the end of the session she said: ""When should I see you again? Within 3 weeks? Should we take a break? I felt like if she was trying to say ""I am done with you. This is the best I can help you be"". After the session, I felt pretty dissapointed like if full remediation for me was not possible. I am really reluctant to be just functional and still have an eating disorder. I have lived like that for years and it has been torturing. I want to achieve full recovery. I know I have improved a lot since I started to work with her (2 years ago). She was a good fit for me and I have progressed as ever. But now, her comment made me feel like I have gone a long way and I am at the best I could be. What should I do? I often doubt about ""full recovery"" being possible. I often dream of it but feel it as an impossible thing for me. However, I still want it. On the other hand, I feel quite ashamed of discussing the reaction I had to my therapist's comment with her. I understand therapy can not last forever but at the same time, I feel I am still not ready to quit. Any ideas as of how to handle this are welcome.

When I was 17, I was diagnosed with bulimia, but my emotional and eating symptoms were more like anorexia, but my doctor didn’t diagnose me with it because I wasn’t below the normal weight for my age and height. Throughout the past 3 years, I’ve had relapses and recoveries, I am now 20 and I think I might be relapsing again, but I don’t know. I’ve started intermittent fasting and I think that’s starting to trigger the restrictive behaviours, but I don’t want to stop because I just want to look the way I used to when I was going through the most severe part of my eating disorder. I’ve never been hospitalized or had a real treatment recovery plan, I kinda just took it on myself throughout the years, with it getting better and then relapsing again. I just started feeling like this yesterday and it’s scary and I don’t wanna tell anybody. I live with my partner currently and I don’t want to tell him because I feel like I want to hide it which I know isn’t right, but I don’t want anybody being concerned for me or trying to get me to eat or stop fasting.

Yet my sister is really huge into dieting and it's such a trigger for me, I cannot eat or even be in the same room with her when food is involved or I am immediately tempted to fall back in old habits. She is not aware of my ED, only my parents know, and when I see her engage in dieting behaviors I just feel like a failure for not 'competing' with her and not engaging in them, and since Im not engaging in them I am 'unhealthy'. Any advice for coping with diet talk and habits that you cannot avoid? I'd also like to mention while I'm at it, that I know recovery has alot of 'symptoms' when you start, I've semi-hurdled the bloating and constipation stage yet does anyone else still have discomfort in their chest? When I was at my worst I would constantly get chest pains and such, yet since I've been eating normally they have subsided, yet if I dont eat for a longer period of time I start to get out of breath and chest discomforts/throbs, is there a reason as to why this is happening?

Funnily enough, that seems easier and more instantly gratifying to me than just simply changing my diet.

Being in recovery during these unprecedented times has been so challenging for me. I feel guilty for the weight I've gained, and I also feel guilty for worrying about my weight when there are so many bigger issues currently going on in the world.

131,bunnyteaparty,06/10/2020,Doubts,"I've technically been recovering for about a year now, and I've started looking back at before going into recovery and seeking recovery. I keep feeling guilty and wrong for the fact that I sought out treatment myself rather than someone making me, and that it was for myself, when everyone at my old treatment center seemed to have been forced or going in for non-selfish reasons. I sought recovery because I discovered more about what eating dsorders were and got tired of suffering. It makes me feel like I wasn't sick enough, despite the fact that I was diagnosed with anorexia and food and weight really did take over my life for years. It makes me feel like I was just going through disordered eating and was being overdramatic. I felt so motivated in the beginning of my recovery, and while yes much of that motivation did go down after realizing how difficult recovery was overtime, it just makes me feel so guilty that right at the beginning, I did try to eat the meals they put in front of me without much pushback, while I felt scared, I also felt glad to eat. I know that's technically a good thing, but it just doesn't feel like the ""right"" thing a person with an eating disorder would do. Now I'm just in this weird ""partial recovery"" stage where I'm eating somewhat regularly, but I'm still scare to eat certain foods and still keep certain impulses. I just want to relapse, I feel so guilty anytime I give in to my hunger and eat, but with my hunger cues being back for so long at this point it can be difficult not to. Right now I feel so hungry, but I'm scared to eat because I know if I did eat I'd be failing. I just wish I could go back in time and tell myself to never go into recovery, to keep going to see how long somebody notices, or until it's too late to recover. Funny how when I was in the treatment center, I remember saying that I was scared of relasping in the future, now I'm scare of never relasping. Does anyone else have any similar doubts and feelings?

138,Floral_linen,05/28/2020,"I'm pretty sure I'm relapsing, I need help please.","Ive been going through some stress situations at home and for a few weeks I had random thoughts about not eating. Like in those instances, suddenly it was normal to think, ""No, I can't eat that, too many calories."" And then I'd stop and think, ""Wait, what?? I recovered years ago. Why did I just think that??!""Fast forward a week and I had an explosive fight at home where I went to bed without dinner. They told me to eat and I insisted I just want to go to bed. I was too upset and angry and lost to care about food. I just wanted to sleep and wake up and it be over. They kept telling me to eat, I kept saying no, until ultimately I just went to sleep. It's almost like that triggered something in me because I started fasting. Not out of want to fast, but I'm afraid to have solids. Suddenly I just didn't have interest in food. Then I had fear of it. I'm so afraid now and I don't know why! I don't think I'm fat, I'm fine with my body, but I can't lie that seeing my body get smaller these past 9 days feels good and motivates me even though I know it's water weight at this point, and the more days go by the stronger I feel. I feel so guilty saying that.Anyway, I need to figure out how to break this fast without getting badly constipated like I did in the past. Can anyone recommend what foods I should start to eat slowly, or how much I should eat when I do start? When I first recovered years ago from a 11yr go with anorexia I had absolute agonising pains because I started to eat again way too fast. I don't want that again I'm so scared.I don't even know when or if I can bring myself to start eating again, but it will make it easier, more potential and less scary if I at least know how to start.Thanks for any advice you can give!

I became anorexic at age 14, and continued not eating until about 3 years ago, when weight started flying off of me. As it turns out, I had developed pancreatitis, and it was more effective at causing me to lose weight than anything I could do to myself voluntarily.After diagnosis, I put a lot of effort into putting weight back on in order to qualify for surgery. I made it to X pounds by consuming about X calories per day. I nevertheless had zero muscle tone and had bedsores from my office chair.Now, after surgery I eat X calories per day and can't keep the weight from piling on. I have put on X pounds, and now weigh X pounds. It keeps climbing!! I am not diabetic and I am taking probiotics to curb any SIBO. I also take supplements to curb cravings. I eat a very well balanced diet and I walk a brisk pace each night. I am RAVENOUS.I just don't understand why my weight keeps going up instead of down and why I am so hungry. My digestive enzymes don't seem to impact my weight at all, plus or minus. I've been told that I am exiting starvation mode, but I don't know what to do with that information.

144,tryingtobebrave,05/11/2020,Ed thoughts ,"I had been doing really well in recovery for a while. But something recently triggered the ED voice in my head again and it’s been sticking around. Certain types of foods, mainly anything “sweet”, or making my favorite beverage sweet. I used to be really afraid of it but in recovery came to normalize it as its the only way I enjoy it. But I’ve been berating myself for it, and today forced myself to exercise and now this evening am excruciatingly reminded of the reason i haven’t been exercising until I get my surgery; the increase in my chronic pain is too much to bear from any type of exercise. I even talked about this with my dietitian and while I never fully made peace with it, it at least had not been consuming my thoughts because I know it’s temporary, I can get my body strong in a healthy way after I heal from surgery and my pain is under control.
But after seeing someone lose a drastic amount of weight, I’ve become ashamed of myself because so many people said she’s healthy now and her old body was unhealthy, and her old body is closer to how mine is now in recovery. Before recovery I looked similar to this persons weight loss. But being malnourished is not healthy. Having thoughts consuming your mind about food and weight and exercise is not healthy.

146,bensolossmile,05/03/2020,I think I am relapsing,"So, I have been in recovery, and even beyond weight restored for a few years now, and have had minimal issues, I have little episodes here and there where I delve back into old habits, but usually am able to get myself out if it. Recently, I have started antidepressants again, which I have taken before, after my EDNOS diagnosis, and didn't have this issue. But the past couple of weeks, my appetite has gone away completely. I have a hard time telling myself to eat, because the ED part of my brain that is still there, I guess, tells me to just go with it. Like, I know I need to eat, and I *do* feel hunger, but I get worried to eat because I am starting to feel guilt. I have gotten to where I go go 24hours or more with no food, and even then feel anxious to eat.

152,ouroboros,04/28/2020,Severe slip,"For the last year or so, I've felt better able to handle my recovery from the decade of anorexia and bulimia I've been slipping into and out of than ever before. Making choices that were good for my health weren't ever easy, but they were always options that, more often than not, I found myself taking. I was, finally, /proud/ of myself. Over the last few months, I began taking antidepressants that I heard would allow me to lose weight, as a by-product, so, triggered, I relapsed and ""used that opportunity"" to severely restrict again, somehow going back on all of the good habits I'd formed prior to then. Now, I've slipped into a bout of the ED as bad as it ever was. Every morning I think, this is the day I fix this, and minutes later, I spiral deeper in. I oscillate between wanting/having the energy to recover and apathy overcoming me, diving into EDs of new forms.

I am not saying that the eating is 100% better.  That I love my body at this size.  But I am saying that I am using a very powerful word, NO.  It is an important word in many ways.  YES is also a powerful word.  Two very small words with a lot of power.  I am thankful for these words and being able to apply them in my life.  Yes to life, no to death.

178,KateM04,04/06/2020,I don't know what to do,"Hi, I don't really know what the say, but I feel like I need to get this out because it's fusterating me inside! I have been in recovery for a little over 2 months and in my eyes I have gained a considerable amount of weight and I believe I am in a good place. I had an appointment with my dietian today, and they told me that I need to keep having all 3 of my supplements that I am meant to be having. I had an appointment with them 3 weeks ago, and they told me to add various things into my eating plan here and there, but I didn't do any of it because it really scared me what was going to happen to my body interms of weight gain if I did eat the extra food as well as the supplements, as my weight was already increasing without the extra food and I was feeling very uncomfortable even with the increase in weight with the original amount of food.
A couple of weeks ago, which was a week after the appointment I did my weekly weigh in at home and my weight had jumped up, which was really scary for me, and I felt like I couldn't bring myself to eating more food with this increase. I cut out all 3 of my supplements, but I followed my meal plan from when I weight myself till today. In those two weeks I felt happy and comfortable with what I was eating, and nothing seemed that bother me.
I am scared that my weight is going to jump up again, and I don't want to be big again, as that is something I am very insecure about. I just want to stay where I am where I am happy!
The dietitian also gave me a goal weight range today and it is not what I though it would be at all, and it is very close to the weight I was before I started restricting.This is triggering me to start restricting again, I don't know what to do. Even though my family say that I am skinny now, genuinely when I look at myself in the mirror I feel like I already am gaining weight!
Someone please help! I don't know what to do, I don't want to restrict again but I don't want to be the weight that the dietian thinks would be right for me, I am really self conscious now and get really anxious when I have my supplements because of fear of gaining weight. It like another 2 weeks before I see my dietian again, and nobody in my family seems to understand how hard it is for me to feel comfortable about gaining weight.
I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense and I kind of a ramble on... But I need some help, can anyone relate. I am really anxious and don't know what to do!

We are advised to know and avoid our triggers, but I am quarantined with my partner’s daughter and this is a massive trigger for me. So much so that I have relapsed after 18 months of recovery. She is tall and skinny, with the body of a supermodel (she is 14). I am short and a healthy size following weight restoration. I feel fine in my day to day life. Obviously there are good days and bad days but in general I feel relatively content. However being stuck inside the house next to my partners daughter, I feel like a complete and utter mess. I look so short and fat next to her and there’s nowhere I can escape to. Sitting in the confines of the home I feel like a completely different person detached from reality outside. My usual trick when I’m feeling down is to read some body positivity blogs or look at some pictures of celebrities with similar bodies to mine, but then as soon as I look up and see myself next to her all my positive thoughts disappear. I just can’t shake it.

Not too long, considering. I lost some weight, but have gained it back. Just this past couple of weeks, my dietitian, doctor and I had decided it was okay for myself to workout again, at a slow pace.I have been doing a variety of exercises and I am eating (from what I remember from before the ED) plenty to support even more than what I am doing, but it feels like my body is super irritated. I am trying to eat a lot more too. But regardless I feel really really swollen, especially in my gut. I am drinking plenty of water as well. I guess I am just worried that I am backtracking and halting the progress that I have made. My doctor said I was not, but maybe to cut back on the exercises.Regardless of the amount of targeted workouts I have been doing. I only seem to be gaining weight in my stomach, which is starting the anxiety again and leading to thoughts of dieting and working out excessively. Which I immediately put a stop to. Does anyone have any advice or experience in this part of recovery and starting to workout again? I am very active generally and hate that the effort I put into working out is not creating any results.Does anyone have a similar experience, with a potentially shorter eating disorder and recovery time?",_admin_moderator,"Wed,04/01/2020-7:20pm",annem,"Hi annem.

185,koolkat07,03/30/2020,Feeling alone,"I feel so helpless. I had been doing really well for a couple of months now and hadn’t purged or binged at all. I’d been maintaining a healthy, balanced relationship with food and then all of a sudden when I went on spring break 3 weeks ago I just lost complete and total control of my eating. Day one I began binging every day like crazy, unable to stop myself. I began gaining weight extremely fast and my confidence has just been at its lowest it’s ever been at. I found myself going back to my old habits of over exercising for hours a day and even making myself throw up again to try and minimize the weight gain but my hinges have been SO overwhelming that no possible amount of damage control has been able to keep the weight off. Every day I have tried to show myself grace and keep a positive mindset of “tomorrow is a new day to make better choices” and then I wake up and binge again and the cycle repeats. It’s taking a HUGE toll on my mental health and I just feel so hopeless and like I just would rather die than continue destroying my body and my health every day. I’ve tried to be as open as possible with my therapist and with my mom about my episodes and feel like I’ve done everything possible to stop the binges (removing trigger foods, planning out meals, keeping a food/feelings diary, staying out of the kitchen) and NOTHING is working. It has never ever been this bad before and I have no idea what’s going on with me I feel like I’m going crazy and I feel so bad for my mom because she can’t even keep any food in the house because of her monster of a daughter who will devour every scrap of food before she can even get a chance to eat any of it. I’ve even caught her trying to HIDE food from me! How sad is that! I’m such a burden on her and I bet she’d be so much happier without me in her life. I just wish i was normal. I don’t know what to do anymore. No matter how much I seem to eat my brain screams at me to eat and eat and eat and it’s literally like a tunnel vision, lost time situation where I will just eat one simple thing and then it just is unstoppable and I don’t even know what I’m doing until I’ve eaten everything in the cabinets.

I tried to explain that it’s not that I WONT handle the hearing and legal part to get the surgery, I /can’t/. With my ptsd, this stress pushes me way over the edge and I CAN’T. I don’t know how to explain it any better but my mind just can’t tolerate it without pushing me into crisis.
So now I feel belittled and looked down on from both of them, I don’t know if he’ll help or not, and I feel completely hopeless.

196,Steff,03/15/2020,How to eat?,"Hi everyone!
I've been doing well with my recovery for a few months but lately I was searching for a better and more intuitive style of eating.
For the last few years I've been maintaining pretty healthy diet and eating about X kcal a day. Lately I've came to the information that it's not enough for a woman and I should be eating at least X kcal. Even though my diet kept me satisfied I believed that because I still binge from time to time.
I have to mention that I don't starve myself and I eat every time I feel hungry. I am looking for a new way of eating because I am tired of controlling how much I eat and what time during the day. I'm also afraid that I may have slowed metabolism or even damaged.
I want to ask about your approach to eating during recovery. Do you give up all restrictions and eat whenever you want?

200,efo11,03/02/2020,Joint Hypermobility/pain,"So this probably a super weird question...but has anyone else had issues with their joints? I struggled with anorexia for about a year and a half before I began to recover. Ever since gaining weight, I have noticed how my joints are extremely mobile and I have back pain worse than ever before. When I was at my lowest weight I did not notice either of these issues, but now that I’ve gained some weight, I feel it a majority of the time. My major in college is athletic training so it is very body-involved, and requires quite a bit of strength. My joints pop all the time when doing normal motions or even placing moderate pressure on someone else. I also am extremely flexible to the point where my classmates think they are going to hurt me. I am assuming this is just due to a lack of muscle and stabilization of the joints? As for the back pain, its the same idea. I have gotten adjusted at a chiropractor but the pain returns quickly, I can't imagine it a muscle tightness issue considering I don't really have any right now, as I have not returned to exercising regularly.
