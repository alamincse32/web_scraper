0,fullsun,06/04/2021,i don't know whats wrong with me and i get triggered so easily,"pre quarantine ive always had a really good relationship with food and my body, i was the type who never really gave much thought into it and just ate what i wanted comfortably. once covid hit and we all had to stay home, and till now im with my family 24/7. i started getting into working out (which ive never done before), and with that i started becoming a little more conscious about my food intake. i noticed my older sister started restricting what she ate and i felt bad for eating as much as i did so i tried doing the same. things kept going until i developed a bad relationship with food and dropped down to an unhealthy weight. i told myself i would try to get better and eat more, and to this day im doing my best not to restrict because i know how damaging it is to me both mentally and physically, but whenever i see my sister eating really little i feel extremely anxious and panicky and upset at myself for eating as much as i do and i end up acting very mean/snappy to my sister. i feel so bad for even getting triggered in the first place. i feel like im becoming such a mean and controlling person and i want to change but i can't get away from what triggers me, how do i deal with it instead? :(",_admin_moderator,"Sat,06/05/2021-10:29am",Welcome!,"Hi fullsun, Welcome to the forums!

I've been doing really well and being really motivated in recovery (anorexia) but lost the sense of smell and taste two days ago and feel awful. I'm struggling to cope and struggling to keep eating, which I suspect is probably due to the virus although I don't have any other major symptom aside from headache and fatigue.

4,yoyokay,09/08/2020,Covid-19 has been an excuse for not getting better,"I do not know if anyone else will have similar experiences with these feelings, but here is what has been on my mind for quite some time now:
My ED seems to be using the Covid-19 Pandemic as an excuse for not recovering. It has made me want to ""put off"" getting healthy and gaining weight. A lot of my motivations for getting healthy again are irrelevant because of the pandemic. My brain thinks, ""What is the point of getting to a healthy weight? You still won't be able to get tattoos or travel for who knows how long."" I of course know that I would likely feel a lot better, be able to sleep, and be less stressed about food, but I have gotten so used to my typical routine of feeling like garbage and barely making it through the day, and without the opportunity to even do any of the things I had looked forward too before ED, it is so hard to find any motivation. I also have depression, which I have struggled with for years, so it just adds more hopelessness to my mindset. Another piece of this is that I kind of feel like my ED is invalidated because with shelter-in-place, no one has really seen how much weight I have lost. I know that I shouldn't have to ""prove"" my Anorexia and that EDs occur at any size, but still, in the back of my mind, I think I have to preserve this skinny body.

8,pursoul,08/06/2020,COVID & health issues triggering ED,"TL/DR - COVID has worsened my stress related health issues (some autoimmune) and the weight loss from one of them has triggered an ED crisis and strong urge to relapse.When COVID and shelter at home started, I unexpectedly lost weight, which I only noticed because my pants were looser than normal. I have digestive issues (IBD, IBS, and others) and I saw my gastroenterologist who had me make med changes in hopes of stopping the weight loss and other digestive health symptoms (sorry, trying to not be triggering or gross by listing them). But my weight loss has continued, though it's slowed. There's been several problems with this situation:
1) I don't own a scale as I get triggered by knowing exactly how much I weigh. But now I had to start being weighed. I tried to only have it happen at doctor's offices because I ask them to not tell me the number and let them monitor it. But that's less possible now with COVID and I've had to weigh myself and record the weight.
2) There's been too much discussion about my weight by everyone - doctors, friends, family, and it means I think about it more and more. Just 2 days ago, a friend expressed great concern with how I looked (too thin). (I am still in the healthy BMI range.)
3) With COVID, I'm anxious about going to stores unnecessarily and when I do my every other week grocery shopping, I refuse to buy the foods I used to binge on. I recovered from the restricting anorexia I had in my teens twenty years ago, but I never got over the disordered eating of binging unhealthy foods and then restricting after to prevent weight gain. I've been successful at maintaining a constant ""normal"" weight, so I've just left my recovery linger there. But now, when I want to emotionally eat, I can't unless I want to risk getting COVID for a food binge run. So I don't eat anything (I'm not saying I skipped a meal but that I don't eat the extra I normally do - I'm choosing to shut down and numb instead of eating my emotions). At first, I thought I was fine. At the start of COVID, I was at my sister's helping with my nephews (her and her husband are essential workers in healthcare) nearly everyday from mid-March through the end of May and they were feeding me, so I ate normally. But that's also when I lost the most weight, though it happened pretty rapidly right at the beginning, again when I was eating regular meals and not paying attention to amount or content because I was just having a nice family meal. But now, I'm home alone most times and I've grown to really like how much weight I lost. I also notice the loose skin and untoned arms, etc. I'm pretty sure I've started eating less, on top of not bingeing, so now I don't know if the continued weight loss is my health issue or my eating behaviors. I see my gastroenterologist on Monday, so I've been thinking about it a lot, but I wasn't concerned until my friend expressed so much concern about my weight and if I am truly honest with myself, my face looks gaunt, not healthy. I've noticed I've been exercising more, though it looks healthy because I'm walking my dog, but I'm choosing hilly areas and sometimes doubling the length of walks. But what's really concerned me is that I finally broke down and bought my favorite binge food to go with a food my sister made me from scratch. But, I'm barely eating it. Even when I'm emotional, I see how much I have a smug satisfaction that I'm not eating the binge food. When I have a very small serving, I find myself satisfied I had so much restraint. I see me sliding down a slope where I try to control COVID by controlling my weight and what I eat and how much and when. I am starting to worry about where this leads. I'm trying to figure out my next step. But I can say that I don't want to go back to my ""normal"" weight. I like how I look and I want control over wanting to eat and I feel good about life. But I'm also pretty sure there's a darker side because I don't want to say anything to my therapist or too much to my gastroenterologist or to reach out to my PCP. I want to see how much less I can eat and how much ""healthier"" I can eat and if I can lose even more weight. I feel like I'm at that fork in the road between health and relapse and I'm not sure I'm capable of picking the healthy path. It's not that I've never come close to or actually briefly relapsed, it's that I always had people around who were kind of silently keeping tabs and I had reasons to enjoy food and I wasn't so afraid of everything that's happening in the world and so very desperate for control over something. If I'm not going to binge and eat my emotions, then I feel I need to restrict to numb them, to control them. This time, it will be much much harder to choose to eat. It's always a choice, every time I eat, there's that evil voice in my head encouraging me to restrict, but everyday, nearly every meal, I've overcome it for years. But right now, I don't want to. It will be so much energy to overcome those thoughts. I don't know how to pick the better path right now. This seems like the perfect solution to all sorts of problems. I need support.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,08/07/2020-3:43pm",Dear pursoul,"Welcome to the forums!

9,pupper,05/20/2020,TFW you think you're 100% recovered but then BAM here comes quarantine!,"TLDR: Covid is bringing back old pre-recovery feels. Who else is feeling this? What healthy coping mechanisms do you use? I'd been considering myself ""officially recovered"" from my eating disorder for a couple years now, but like many others in this situation I feel like I'm starting to relapse thanks to covid19. I suffered from a combination of multiple disordered eating habits and over-exercising. I only talk to my therapist every other week now and stopped going to my dietitian because I didn't feel like I needed them (also my therapist is expensive and I'm a poor grad student haha!). But over the past month or two, as my work schedule was cut in half, going to the grocery store has become an anxiety-attack trap, and climbing gyms are closed (climbing and riding bikes are my activities of choice), I'm starting to feel like the lack of control is putting me back in that ED headspace of needing to control something, feeling discontent with my body, extremely paranoid that I'm gaining weight, etc. One thing I've been trying to do that I think would be helpful is limiting how much time I spend on social media (this has proven to be very difficult haha!). As a cyclist I follow a lot of fellow cyclists and cycling accounts, and I've found that exercise-heavy instagram accounts make me think more about how little I am exercising in comparison to them, and then I feel bad about myself (I know this is totally irrational since some of them are professionals, or racers, or whatever, and I'm not at that level nor do I want to be nor would it be healthy or realistic for me to be, but I still compare myself with them subconsciously). The weather has been pretty crappy too this spring so there've been many days when I don't even want to be outside. But even so, I feel this guilt on days when I don't exercise and then I start doing this very negative self-talk, accusing myself of things that I know deep down aren't true or real but that's all part of the disorder I suppose. I'm trying to do deep breathing exercises when I start getting freaked out, and I'm trying to talk to people who empathize with me. My partner is supportive too but since we are quarantined together I feel bad for constantly complaining about my ED to him all the time, especially since he really has no idea what it's like. I wish I could be totally content with my body and unconcerned about it like he is about his own. Today has been an especially rough day. I had planned this relatively long and strenuous ride to do today but due to mechanical issues with my bike wasn't able to do it after all, and felt real crappy about not riding on a day when I finally have a chance to. At work I sit in front of a computer all day and that lack of movement bothers me, and I've been driving there instead of riding my bike so that I can give a coworker a ride, and that makes me feel crappy too. Also in grad school, most of my classes are online (especially now) which requires a lot of sitting at my computer doing schoolwork. These things trigger this feeling of discontent and disgust at my body, feelings that I honestly have not felt in probably three or four years, and I feel like my recovery progress is being peeled back bit by bit. I just feel like this big dark cloud of doom is slowly gliding over toward me. This feeling is so familiar to me but I haven't felt it like this for a while. I feel unmotivated to do things that I normally enjoy and sometimes all I want to do is take a nap that lasts all dang day so I don't have to worry about stuff and can pass the time without having disordered thoughts. I've been tempted to buy a scale recently but I know that will not lead to anything good. I've even thought about borrowing a scale from my workplace but I keep having to tell myself that it will not do any good. I gotta keep reminding myself that it's not all that bad. There are some silver linings to this quarantine thing for me and I am grateful for them. Still, I have days when I feel like I'm slipping back down to that dark place and those feelings come back and haunt me.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,05/21/2020-2:24pm",Dear supper,Welcome to the forums!

10,AvatarKyoshiStyle,07/31/2020,Want to Talk with others with similar problems...? (Yes that's a q mark),"Hi.So I'm almost eighteen and I'm a little concerned about how I eat. I'm a healthy weight, but I've realized I focus a lot about my food. I started tracking what I eat around five years ago when my older friend got me into fitness and running. I became very restrictive, and sometimes would skip meals if they didn't suit my idea of healthy (My clubs often go until 8 or 9 and then it takes me an hour to bike home, but I wouldn't like the food so sometimes I'd just skip eating and then eat a lot at home). After I quit x country freshman year of highschool I put on X pounds and became sort of self conscious about it. Then when I went on vacation I got up to X lb which was a lot for me, I'm 5'2. After that I went on an X diet for a few weeks, then X to got X, but since then it just feels like I'm either putting on weight of dieting. I have a habit of eating really well and then not, and then eating a bunch of X and stuff, so I'll gain again and then drop it. I think I'd probably gain more but I can't drive so I bike everywhere. I wouldn't really describe myself usually as having any disordered type of eating, because I'm a healthy weight, but I'm always thinking about my food. I always make meals that are different from what the rest of my family eats. If I'm putting on weight I'm stressed and feeling kinda bad. I don't purge, and I wouldn't say that I exercise compusively, but I'm getting sorta nervous. I don't like the idea of being labeled with an eating disorder, especially because for the most part I think I'm in good health, but I feel self conscious about how I eat. I'm not sure that a lot of my friends track their food like I do, and worry about it so much. And if I'm honest I'm sort of sick of either being ill because I’ve eaten too much or too little. I'm not really sure what to do,and I just want to talk with people who maybe experience the same thing. I don't have the sort of personality where people think I'd struggle with this (whatever it is). People see me eat, watch me exercise, I'm very loud very energetic, very confident. I get that struggling with this sort of stuff is supposed to be normal, but I'm not comfortable enough to just bring it up to my friends.I guess that I'd just like to talk to people who I feel like won't be sort of scared of me if I say stuff like this. I just kinda want to be able to talk to others with something similar.
So I guess just comment? Or offer advice? Whatever the spirit compels?

11,dainna43,07/19/2020,Feel like giving in to the disorder,"This whole year has been a real struggle for me with my disorder. At the beginning of the year I uninentionally lost a substantial amount of weight at a festival, and being at this lower weight (and enjoying the compliments and self-satisfaction along with with it) drove me back into some really disordered eating habits. I managed to keep myself busy with work (40-50 hour weeks) to avoid binging, however I found myself mentally and physically exhausted, not prioritising my health and often falling into the cycle of binging and purging.After this happened, then covid happened, and I felt like I was in the worst headspace possible to go through this. I'm trying to adopt strategies to keep myself busy (to avoid binging), and I'm lucky to have a job in hospitality 3 days a week, however on my days off I feel like I am constantly thinking about food, and after every meal I feel bloated or fear of gaining weight. I've tried to properly recover during this time by implementing regular meals (like what they do in recovery after discharge) however, after a few days I feel overweight or unhappy with my body, and restrict and use disordered eating habits to return back to a weight that I am happy with.To add to things, we live in a small house, and I feel like I am constantly being watched by my parents. I went through recovery 6 years ago using family based therapy, and I achieved the 'goal weight' however my mental health has been pretty inconsistent and I've felt consumed by the disorder since my first round of recovery. I feel a sense of bitterness towards my parents as I feel that their approach to my recovery was quite disconnected (they just wanted me to get back to normal so their lives could get back to normal), and I had no real support during my recovery due to their inability to try to understand the severity of my disorder, or they tried to apply their own 'formula' to my recovery, without considering my feelings and emotions. Being with them 24/7 is triggering thoughts from my past whilst also making me feel quite isolated, with no one to confide in, or no way to let my thoughts out.Anyways, I bottled up these emotions for years and eventually I just let them all out during and argument with my parents. I told my parents about the binging, constant weighing and how my headspace is really unhealthy and painful almost all the time. They proceeded to say that you can't change the past (which I know is true), but completely disregarded my feelings once again, and I felt like it reopened the wound from six years ago, whilst also ignoring my current pain, making me feel more isolated than ever. So, I'm basically at this stage where Victoria is in lockdown for the next 6 weeks, and I'm stuck with my parents who have complete disregard for my emotional headspace, and entrapment within my own disordered cycle, but also I revealed all my disordered strategies to them, so now I have to be super secretive whilst weighing food and myself etc. I thought that telling them would help, but rather its left me feeling trapped and my disordered thoughts feel harder to fight than ever.Sorry about the rant but I felt like I needed to let it out, and hopefully make some of you guys feel less alone.

12,pilipinay,05/06/2020,Do I have an eating disorder or it's just me,"Hi i'm actually not from the states but I do have relatives there. In our country, eating disorders are not very much discussed but it is a toxic trait of our nationality that kids are getting teased when we get chubby. I was chubby in my teen years but I decided to lose some weight cause of all the aunties teasing me and as well my family...since then I have been very strict on what i eat and I feel guilty when i over indulge from my favorite foods.. I was thinking at some point "" why is it so easy for others to eat a lot and still look great? while i haven't reached my ideal weight and I get fat by just eating my favorite food??""until now in my adulthood, I've always continued my healthy lifestyle, but when i get to college i have times that i just can't eat healthy cause fast food are more convenient for me but I try to eat healthy at least once a day...Now in isolation, I have decided to set a goal for myself but cant complete my exercise or food goals and feel guilty.So to summarize: i've been having hard time in my eating psychology and sometimes it depresses if it's really an illness (cause i have not went to a doctor and seems like not lots of doctors sepcialize this condition here in our place) or is it just me overacting to what i want to look like?? heheh i think i just need someone to talk to :(",_admin_moderator,"Thu,05/07/2020-3:29pm",Dear pilipinay,"We are sorry to hear you are struggling.

13,BrokenBird14,07/11/2020,What do I do? ,"I have never been to a therapist. My family can't really afford one, so I've never gone. I feel guilty being in a place like this without an official diagnosis, and I'm still partially in denial that I have a problem. Spring semester of 2019, I was really bad off though. I was down to a very low weight, I was having urges to throw my food back up, I was over-exercising, restricting or skipping meals, and I was getting very thin. I didn't see that though. People would point out that I was getting thin, but I didn't see myself as too thin. When COVID hit, I was laid off from work, my classes were put off for a while, and the gym was closed. I do love food so I end up in these conflicts with myself cause I just want to eat, but then I feel so horrible for doing so. It'd take me ages to figure out what to make for a meal, cause in my head I'd be calculating all the nutrition and caloric info to see what would be the ""healthiest."" I gained back some weight over the quarantine, and I am a very small woman so it shows. Classes, work, and even the gym is back up and I can already feel myself starting to slide down that hole again. I eat and I feel sick, I end up binging cause I'm so hungry and I feel bad about it, but then I barely eat for a while cause I have no appetite. I look in the mirror and all I can seem to look at is where it's not perfect. All I see are flaws, and I feel like I need to punish myself for not doing better during quarantine, despite still exercising and eating fairly healthy. I want to feel beautiful. I am uncomfortable with the way I look, but I also don't want to end up down that rabbit hole again. I don't want to be dizzy, hungry, and obsessive. Those who have been through this and recovered, what did you do? How do you fight back those thoughts when you start gaining back weight? How do you ensure that you eat the right amount? Not too much not too little. I want comfort, to be told I'm going to be alright despite the world falling to pieces around me, and to be told I'm beautiful and believe it, which I know sounds stuck-up and silly. I also want to know what I can do to get better. I have a wonderful boyfriend, he doesn't know about what's going on since he lives in another country, but I want to take care of myself for him if not for myself. He means the world to me. I rambled a lot here, sorry about that, but please? I want to know what I can do...",_admin_moderator,"Sat,07/11/2020-2:22pm",Resources to Help,"Hi BrokenBird14, welcome to the forums!

14,girlwhenquiet,06/28/2020,Triggering Family,"I'm with my parents pretty consistently because I live at home. I'm 22. I feel that my father has an undiagnosed eating disorder himself, but he will not receive treatment or believe that he does, which is fine, I guess. I know many of us with EDs have parents who exhibit disordered behavior and thinking. But I currently weigh more than my father, and I am not able to handle his constant self-hatred. Oh, and when I asked politely for him to not comment on his NUMBERS in front of me, he and my mom both get irritated and defensive that I'm trying to ""control"" them, when I'd just like some peace in my own home. I'm trying to not relapse. But at this point I want to so badly that I don't see a point in doing anything. My mental health has declined so much that it is interfering with my work life even. I'm a disaster, and I feel as though I cannot safely go back to therapy due to COVID. I also feel that I cannot really get anything out of online therapy. I'm processing a lot of personal things right now, but I just don't know what to do. I'm exhausted and I guess I'm trying to vent instead of relapse. I don't know.

17,annie77,04/10/2020,I struggle while in quarantine,"Hi, I´m not quite sure what so say, because I feel like I´m making  everything up and nothing´s actually going on. Please excuse any grammar mistakes, english isn´t my mother language. I´ve struggled with an eating disorder, EDNOS, for over three years and for over the last eight months I was convinced I´m recovered. Recently I realised that I´m actully in quasi-recovery and I still keep so many habits from my ED. This situation doesn´t help at all, because I´m stuck at home where everyone is fighting, my step dad and I don´t have the best relationship and he caused a lot of relapses during my ED and later recovery. I don´t blame him, I know my brain made everything seem so much worse, but because of him I´m anxious, I want to restrict again and lately due to self isolation I feel a lot more insecure about the way I look. I´ve never lost huge amount of weight because of my ED, but I´ve always been skinny. Even now doctors say I´m slightly underweight (because of BMI). I don´t want to put any numbers in here, because I don´t want to trigger anyone, but the thing is I know I´m not fat. But I just want to be perfect and feel in control again. There´s not much I can do about the family situation, believe me, I tried. But nothing is ever good enough for him. I just want to be in charge again and having this little secret, my eating disorder, helps. It´s really hard, because I know it´s wrong and it won´t actually help, but I don´t have the energy to fight back. I don´t know...am I making any sense? I´m really scared to post this, but I keep telling myself that it´s okay to ask for help or even an advice. That´s something I still haven´t learnt.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,05/14/2020-3:47pm",Hi KellyGardner,"Thank you for offering your kindness and support on the forums.

21,slamond,05/08/2020,Struggling with eating,"So I've been in 'recovery' for a year and a half, kind of not trying my best and still holding onto small rules and rituals. I'm not proud of it and from an outsiders perspective, I seem pretty normal. I eat regular meals out, have many snacks and rarely do any type of exercise anymore. The only thing is is that I cannot physically stop myself from eating low-calorie option foods until I feel sick.
I live in an Asian household so we all share main dishes and take our own portions from the middle of the table.
It's just that I will get my portion, finish it before everyone else and then fill my plate up with another serving of a lower-calorie option and keep going until my stomach physically hurts.
I'm so sick of feeling so uncomfortable every single time I leave the dinner table and I hate it so much. Ever since recovery I have this mindset of 'oh there's only a little bit left might as well finish it' of my safe foods and then I take everything.
I really don't know what to do and I'm trying to remind myself that I shouldn't just fill up on that but I cannot stop myself

26,Mollydolly432,04/14/2020,Relapsing in isolation due to moving back with parents,"Hi I had an ED (Anorexia Nervosa) when I was 15 (now 23). I have struggled with body dysmorphia ever since (I never got therapy), but I controlled my eating habits well and didn't fall back into anorexia. I have been living out of home in a dorm since Feb last year. Life was good, I definitely did relapse a little bit but nothing severe. I tried to conform to normal mealtimes, I was restricting (but that's how I've lived since I was a child, I do not like eating breakfast as I have IBS and breakfast upsets my stomach a lot, I also don't wake up hungry), drinking decaf coffee, having other staff instead of real food as post-class but pre-dinner snacks, watched calories on things I bought, etc. It sounds disordered on one hand, but on the other hand it didn't really affect me. It was a long term change. I just learned to have lunch, dinner, and not buy sweets. Food wasn't as available as normal and I was more preoccupied living out of home, so even before I started restricting at all, I was eating a lot less and losing weight. This always happens during times that I am busy/happier, I shed weight as when I am happy and preoccupied I forget food being an existence (in fact, when I was a young child I didn't feel the need to eat at all, only because I felt it was a waste of time alongside more fun activities, and was taken to several docs about this). I should mention I didn't visit my parents as often as I could have since I didn't want to gain weight by going there. When I moved out of home I was on the low end of normal weight. Gradually my weight dropped and I stabilised around borderline underweight. My weight has not gone above this weight since I moved out. I obsessed about my weight a fair bit in the dorm, particularly as I didn't have a scale. I was worried I was constantly gaining weight, but at the same time, if we had parties etc., I would eat food unrestricted. But the food I chose for myself was always low fat, and I am not a picky eater so it didn't really affect me. I felt I was eating to live, eating was a nuisance amongst everything I needed to do.
I thought I would gain weight this year, as it is a stressful year of placement. Instead, I have been dropping weight and am now quite underweight. I thought I'd gain when I had to move back home when isolation started a month or so ago. Instead I dropped more. At this point I was actually trying to eat more and put on weight. My parents picked up on it a few days ago, and my dad got extremely angry at me (he has chronic severe anger issues), told me it was my fault etc., and is now monitoring me like a hawk and taking control of what I eat and when. He asks me what I ate all the time, he criticises what I am eating. I feel constantly judged.
This has unfortunately been extremely triggering. Now I can't stop thinking about food, my weight, I panic at the feeling of hunger, I don't eat even when I am hungry. My eating was disordered before but it wasn't this bad. My dad's attempts to help have stripped me of control and actually triggered me to go back to a mental state I avoided so well for so long. Yes I restricted food out of home, but I never felt panicked about it, usually it was just a ""Oh I am hungry I will just finish this and then go eat"" not a ""oh I am hungry this is terrible I better just hold it out and not eat because otherwise I will gain weight""... Essentially my dad has made me hyper-conscious of what I eat, which is the exact thing that I have worked so hard for the past 8 years to get rid of. I am terrified of binge eating disorder, I am terrified of gaining weight. This morning I read the weather was warm, I was afraid to wear shorts, afraid to walk around with a figure I assumed was fat due to being on a forced weight gain diet now. Weighed myself, gained a tiny bit, sure, but still very underweight. If I feel fat at this weight, how will I ever be fine with myself in a higher weight again. I will probably fall into a depression and a panic and overeat.
Anyone in this position right now?",_admin_moderator,"Tue,04/14/2020-12:43pm","Dear Mollydolly432, we would","Dear Mollydolly432, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove weight, BMI and height numbers as well as mentions of specific food items, which are not allowed on the forums.

On top of depression and ocd symptoms having been ramped up already, I feel so much shame and guilt for not going with my dad to visit her that often.

I haven’t called my best friend in over a week or reached out to anyone but I just can’t seem to stop this downslide. Even more so now.

(Morerators, I hope sharing this insta is ok as it is not my own and is a public resource.)",_admin_moderator,"Fri,04/03/2020-3:38pm",COVID-19 Support,"Hi AndiTutti,Thank you for sharing this resource (yes, it is very much okay).
