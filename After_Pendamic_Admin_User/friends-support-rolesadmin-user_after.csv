0,shawn7851,02/26/2021,Can I Get Some Advice ,"So I met this girl online and after a little while of talking to her she admitted to having an eating disorder to me, this is something new for me and while I did my best to support her as much as possible until the other day when I made a huge mistake, I did not know that her situation was currently as bad as it was in the past. But as we were talking she went to go eat breakfast and when she came back all she had was some nuts, later on in the day she was hungry so naturally I told her it was okay to go get some food, she refused and then insisted she wasn't hungry anymore, and then I said one of the worst things possible, I said ""the nuts didn't fill you up."" I realize I made a huge mistake and owned up to this and now after talking to her for about 8 months she wants nothing to do with me. For her this is a big deal because she's had negative comments from her friends and family before and I knew that. Is there anything I can do to help fix the situation or support her going forward. I feel terrible and I always had the best intentions but something I said as a joke ruined everything and I didn't even think about her eating disorder when I made this comment. If I had just thought about what I said before I said it, I wouldn't be in this situation. But I can't take back what I said and I own up to my actions. I just would like some advice if anybody has been in a situation like this or if you've been a victim of negative comments.",_admin_moderator,"Sat,02/27/2021-10:22am",Hi shawn7851!,"Hi shawn7851, Welcome to the forums.

2,anne91405,10/06/2020,How to help a friend support me and my ED recovery,"Today I told my best friend about my ED. I want her to be apart of my recovery and for her to be there for support. She also said she wants to support me but I know that she has no clue how. What do I do to help her support me? How do I educate her on my ED (anorexia)? I have also only been diagnosed and in recovery for less than two weeks. I was hospitalized for 6 days and then I have only been home for five. I've only had one FBT (Family Based Treatment) therapy session. I am nowhere near recovery, I have literally only just started.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,10/07/2020-11:16am",Welcome!,"Hi!

3,caliconcerned,09/14/2020,Adult hiding possible bulimia,"We are both women in our mid-late 30s and single, living alone. One of my good friends LOVES certain food, all the good food. Yet - I'm pretty sure she's puking it all up. She makes fun of people that ""just eat foods that are labeled as healthy"" and supports anyone eating what they want. On the outside, very body positive. On the inside, I know she struggles and gets pressure from her family. I've heard her puking on multiple occasions in the bathroom and have seen evidence in the toilet in other times. We've been friends for years but I've never said anything. I'm not sure how to tackle this. I know she has a therapist but also know that she's pretty secretive, so not sure if this even comes up in therapy. Is this something I should confront? I feel like it will hurt our friendship if I do. How can I let a friend know that I'm concerned and try and get her to confide in me?",_admin_moderator,"Tue,09/15/2020-10:09pm",Welcome!,"Hi.

4,Lucysky,07/13/2020,Advice For Friend ,"Hi,I have a friend that is interested in getting help but is scared to ask for it. She told me she went to a doctor’s appointment to look into a possible heath issue that was bothering her. She got blood work done too. All came back normal. She did get the courage to tell her doctor she dealt with restriction//bulimia in her past as she feared this may be related to her possible issue. The doctor had just responded with “did you do it everyday?”  She mentioned to her doctor she did.  The conversation had ended at that point.  She was unable to tell the full details of her past history as well as say she went back into it this past year and was too scared to ask for help now. What would be the best way for her to ask for help/ get help? I talked to her but she is still too scared to ask. She thinks because she is not underweight and her results were fine she won’t be taken seriously.  She feels embarrassed to book another appointment because her last appointment had ended with everything was dealt with. Her doctor did recommend she book an appointment with a nutritionist as a last resort with her health issue because everything came back normal. She did tell me she was going to book an appointment with a nutritionist but wasn’t sure if she should share her history with the nutritionist, both past and present or would even have the courage to do this.  Do you think she should try to start to share this with the nutritionist? I am proud of my friend for at least talking to me and want to help her anyway I can. I greatly appreciate any advice regarding this.Lucy",_admin_moderator,"Mon,07/13/2020-10:05pm",Welcome!,"Hi Lucy, we’re so glad you’re here.
