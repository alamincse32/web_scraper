1,Cath1,10/03/2021,Managing the stages of recovery and what to stay,"My daughter (20yrs)is on the recovery journey from anorexia. Following a hospital stay she is now home and has put on weight. She now has moments where in her words she binges and also feels she is always hungry. Apparently this can happen - can it??  She now really hates/ is utterly disgusted with how she looks and thinks she is overweight ( which she isn’t) She is so tired of trying to recover and it’s heartbreaking to see her so distressed and disgusted with herself. I understand this is another stage of recovery but whatever we try to do to encourage and support her to keep going just doesn’t resonate and she has a negative response to whatever we say. . She has a psychologist she meets once a week - I have encouraged her to have more sessions as I feel she needs more professional help to help her through this current stage. We also try distraction activities but she’s also  scathing about thisAny others tips/advice that we can use?

- they cannot stand up w/o permission
- no one talks in the groups
- she has not been given boxes and letters we’ve sent. I believe they are being held as incentives
- she has panic attacks and is ignoredI also found a Reddit entry by a past patient about this particular facility that says these things and more.

She is wasting away and completely convinced that she is eating ""healthily,"" and that I'm completely wrong about this. There are issues regarding our family:-she lives in my mother's house (not with me nor my husband)
-she is not motivated to look for a job or interact with anyone who can tell her that she looks visibly ill
-she does not trust me, my husband, nor my youngest daughter (who had an ED 7 years ago).My daughter and I do communicate and if there's something bothering her tremendously, she does ask for my opinion. But she is extremely stubborn and is convinced that she's always correct, and my mother reinforces that. The people around her enable her and COVID has made things much worse. She is completely isolated from any level-headed person who might give an objective opinion on this. She refuses to see a doctor. I have asked her many times to at least go and get a check-up or blood test, but she refuses. Her doctor does not understand EDs and will reinforce what she's doing as ""healthy"" as well, even if she would go and see him.My daughter looks like she is about to collapse at any second.

4,amandaleigh,09/11/2021,Nervously awaiting treatment for 9-yr-old restricting food intake--what can I do to help?,"My daughter turns 9 this month. She has been deeply depressed by isolation and changes during COVID. Over the last few months, she started expressing unhappiness with her body image. This past summer, she developed a habit of collecting saliva in her mouth and not swallowing. Her pediatrician suspected it was a medical issue. We went through an endoscopy and a hospital visit, and after we came home from the hospital it became clear that she was deliberately restricting her food intake. I'm awaiting her initial visit with a counselor. Until then, my fear is that she will get too weak and I will have to take her to an emergency room.

6,august41,06/25/2021,Adult Daughter Suffering From Food Avoidance ED,"My 24 year old daughter, who has lived in another state for the past four years, has returned home with a relapse of anorexia, taking the form of food avoidance and texture issues. In the past, she has been treated for anxiety and depression, with both medication and therapy. She left home to attend school, living with boyfriend. Her relationship (thankfully) ended and she lived on her own for some time, then quit attending school without informing us (she was in a cosmetology program), so all the money we had invested was gone. She began a new relationship, which seemed great, made a single semester stab at college, then moved to another state with boyfriend. The relapse with food issues began off/on last summer, after she had been prescribed a medication for depression/anxiety. She read this medication also can suppress your appetite, so she discontinued it and therapy. Things have gone downhill from there. Her relationship has deteriorated, not only due to her issues, but her boyfriend's controlling and verbally abusive behavior, which really intensified her eating problems. I finally told her to leave and come back to our home, as that was clearly a toxic environment for her. She's been here two weeks. She has always been on the slender size, but is currently less than her normal weight.. She does not NOT eat, but she says at times she'll spend a long time just trying to get herself to eat something. If I cook a meal, she'll eat it. She doesn't purge, she sees her body clearly as it is. We are looking at the best way to get her treatment now and residential seems out of reach financially, even with insurance. We're trying to find counselors to treat her, but she keeps rejecting everyone because she says (based on online info) that they don't have experience with her specific type of ED. On top of all this, she's floundering in terms of knowing what she wants to do with her life in terms of career, boyfriend will not leave her alone, she's conflicted about the relationship - basically, a ton of bricks. I'm unsure of how to move forward with her. She's welcome to stay in our home and receive treatment here, but past issues have made us impatient with her. In the past, she's gone through psychiatric treatment and therapy and didn't following through with it. The ED in the past seemed to be a component of anxiety problems and was helped by treatment for that. She was put into an involuntary psychiatric hold after cutting herself so badly it required a trip to hospital for treatment. That was a nightmare that did more harm than good. She no longer cuts. To add to this, I have a very elderly parent who is requiring more care, a husband who is on dialysis for kidney failure and another child with substance abuse issues. I am a little uninformed about this type of ED as it is not what I have heard about in the past and feel overwhelmed. My daughter is willing and anxious to get treatment, but her past behavior has made me expect she won't follow through with it. I'm overwhelmed and unsure how to find the right treatment that is affordable and accessible. Any advice is welcome.

8,Maare,03/05/2021,How long can she live on nutrition drinks?,"New here and first post. My 15 year old daughter was diagnosed with restrictive anorexia about a month ago. We knew things where going down hill at Christmas. She has been working out and getting in phenomenal shape since last spring. Eating healthy but always eating enough. She was counting calories but always maintained weight. She actually was counting calories so she could eat what she needed to build muscle. She is an amazing volley ball player and came into 9th grade strong as an ox. December came and she got mono. She lost weight because of it and it spiraled her very quickly into very restrictive eating. Long story short she just came out of children's hospital 2 days ago after a 13 day stay and a beginning of a re feeding program. The stay was brutal, but by the end she was eating most meals and came home on a high calorie meal plan. Yesterday she ate half of breakfast and half of lunch. Since then has refused all food. The rages and yelling have stopped, she just sits for the half an hour and just stares, doesn't eat anything, then I give her the supplement and she drinks it in a few minutes and goes back to the couch. doesn't speak to me or anyone unless its to tell me she hates me or i should burn in hell. How long should I let her just drink the supplement beverage? literally today she drank all her calories in beverage form. when do I push and say she can't have it and must eat? and if she refuses? I hate that its the weekend and I can't get a hold of her team at children's hospital.

My daughter has been suffering from bulimia and anorexia since about age 12 and is now 20-years-old.Throughout, she has binged and purged in her bedroom--I have most literally done everything I can to end this cycle and she has been through inpatient and IOP treatment for months at a time twice.When I find her behaviors, which is often, I confront her and tell her she needs to stop doing this. Sometimes she does and sometimes she doesn't. She won't. I won't go into all that I've done to try and change this behavior and get her to take being in recovery seriously, but it has been extensive and all-consuming (yes, I probably need to learn to let go and accept there is little I can do).Does anyone else have experience with this behavior?

She has been anorexic and obese and anorexic and obese.She also suffers from bipolar. She is very intelligent - law school graduate. What to do? She has admitted binge eating a whole cake. She never feels satieted. I am worried about her health. As a teen she asked for a personal trainer. We got her one. She started running and working out and dropped weight and looked very healthy, then the obsession kicked in and she became anorexic. A couple years later it was the other extreme with binging and excessive weight gain in a short period of time. She has lost her gall bladder as a result of the excessive overeating and quick weight loss. I am not sure if it is appropriate, but I want to order her some self-help books. At the risk of butting in, I feel that I need to offer something because I love her. She sees a psychiatrist for anxiety and bipolar but I don't think they even talk about the overeating. Any suggestions for workbooks/books? I have seen many, but not sure what works. There are CBT, DBT, and then specific books about eating disorders.

12,Dneill79,01/01/2021,Adult child won’t eat,"My daughter was a bottomless pit as a child. She ate everything in sight. She came home one summer after being at her father’s and said she wasn’t allowed to eat there—couldn’t have seconds, couldn’t help herself to the cupboards, etc.  Then when she was 15 she wanted to live with her dad. I let her, after so many struggles. She started fainting there. Then after a year, she went to live with my sister. My sister said she would hardly ever eat. She had to force her to eat. She fainted there, too. Then after a year, she went to live with her stepmom. She fainted there, too.  After a year, she came back to live with me. I cook, but not all the time. She’s very picky. If I make something she doesn’t want, she’ll storm in her room and say, “I guess I’ll starve.”  I have gone out of my way to buy food that she asks for. Usually, the food goes bad or just sits in the cupboard because she doesn’t “feel like eating that food anymore.”  The stress was getting to me. I was constantly worried I wouldn’t fix the food she wanted or worried that because we have leftovers, she won’t eat. So I had her stay at my dad’s house for a few days. He had a car he was going to give her  to motivate her to get a job. (She’s 18 and never had a job.) He wasn’t able to get it registered in her name, so she was in a bad mood when she came home. She said she was making a grocery list so she can have food she will actually eat, said grandpa had food she could eat. I asked what food. She told me and said “he actually cooked for us when we told him we were hungry. I’m tired of looking anorexic.”  I said, “you can’t blame me for you not eating.”  She said yes she can. My husband defended me and told her not to blame me for her choices. She got mad and went in her room, slammed the door, and called her friend to pick her up. She texted me and said she’s never coming back, said I’m a horrible mother for not doing things for her, for not cooking, etc.  Obviously I cook. I post new recipes I’ve tried on instagram all the time. I feel like there is a deeper issue here, but I don’t know what it is. Whatever I say to her, she twists my words and says completely the opposite of what the truth is.  I don’t know if she wants me to hand-feed her like a baby or what.",_admin_moderator,"Sat,01/02/2021-10:16am","Hi Dneill79, Welcome to the","Hi Dneill79, Welcome to the forums!

We are beginning treatment next week, but I feel like I am losing my mind when she eats so little. I have personally suffered from bulimia so I know that the disorder is screaming at her that she can't eat more and I also know that I can't force her to eat more because it will make her feel like she is ashamed or angry or whatever. But I spend nearly every waking moment feeling like I'm going to be sick because she is so thin and the amount she eats is barely enough to sustain life. If I leave her alone, she acts much like her normal self but it's eating me alive to stay back. How do you handle the emotions that are so overwhelming? Her siblings are angry with her because they blame her for making me cry so much. I've talked with them about how she isn't choosing to feel the way she does and that her mind is not well right now. They've definitely improved, but I want to stop myself from being so emotional all day long.

14,SDmom,11/11/2020,Daughter denying obvious,"Hello, I'm looking for any advice from people in recovery or from parents who have been where we are. My 15 yr old started binging and purging about a year ago after a summer of binging and gaining. We talked to her therapist and had been monitoring. I talked to her (after reading how to do that) about the signs and our concerns. She completely denied. As things continued, I approached her again, each time she grew increasingly angry and threatening (""you will give me a disorder""). Around August 2020, just after her yearly physical, she stopped eating and dropped significant weight within 3 months. When I brought it up she would get in a rage and tell me things like ""You want me to be sick, you have the problem, you are mean, you wouldn't say this if I was overweight, you are skinny-shaming me, you make me feel bad about myself."" I had to trick her into going to doctor for weight about 2 weeks ago, because she kept denying weight loss. She is medically stable, but now being monitored due to BMI. It's a total battle and she continues her tirade toward me. My husband and I sat her down a few day ago and, with the ammo of her recent weight loss, and expressed our concerns. She blamed the weight loss on depression--which I'm sure is intertwined--but she knows full well she has an ED. We got her back to dr. on Monday and her weight was same (2 wks later). We got her to agree to go back to her old therapist--who is not an ED specialist but a very experienced MFT, who has rapport with her. My daughter has ODD--so is extremely quick to anger, defiant, and impulsive. Our experience is that if you push her against her will, it backfires. For instance, when she was 13 she wanted to pierce her nose. We discussed and agreed she would wait until high school. One night she decided she wanted it right away. I told her we already discussed and she needed to wait, and I wasn't going to talk about it now because it's late (11 pm). I said goodnight, and she went straight into the bathroom and pierced her own nose with a safety pin. Questions:
How do we handle her showers after eating? She goes in the bathroom and turns music on loud. I have talked with her about this and how I think she is purging. She denies and says the showers help her relax. Do we force meals and snacks. Our family dinners have suffered as our kids (1 older brother) have become teens and involved in sports, working, etc. She usually only eats once a day when she eats. She won't eat with us. When do we tell her ""We know you have an ED whether you admit it or not and you need to start taking steps to help yourself or there will be consequences."" It is 100% clear she is not ready, does not want help, and will NOT admit to an ED. My greatest fear is pushing her and having her get worse or do something impulsive. Do we just see how the therapy goes and continue monitoring before taking the next step--forcing higher level of treatment and habits at home?Thank you so much for any suggestions or experience you can offer.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,11/12/2020-4:13pm",Dear SDmom,"We are so sorry to hear about the struggles your daughter and family are having.

15,purplerosehope,11/08/2020,Online Teen Peer Support,"Dear all,D17 was overweight and got herself to lose X pounds from March to September; luckily she never went below normal range in weight, but her restrictive eating got behaviorally out of control and she was hospitalized for first time two months ago due to low HR.  The indicators stabilized and she was released after 5 days in the hospital; the health indicators have remained stable on weekly check-ups ever since.  The last seven weeks at home have been very difficult for everyone but there has been full compliance with meals (even if they take too long), and psychological progress has been very slow but she is starting to make some strides with her therapist and us in terms of accepting the disorder and opening up leads on underlying causes.  Our treatment team is comprehensive (head of adolescent medicine and head psychologist at Children's hospital, both specialists in eating disorders, and highly specialized nutritionist and parent psychologist). They have been very responsive, especially those that are not hospital based; we even have a group chat.In the last two weeks, D17 has opened up quite a bit with therapist and us with underlying causes: years of what she perceives as broad, acute and persistent social rejection in school by peers (she thought caused by being overweight but now she realizes continuing despite weight loss, aggravated by increased academic demands and SAT/ACT testing stress of junior year (as usual, she is an A student across the board) in a pressure cooker top-national prep school and even greater isolation from March through October due to online school and lack of structured school EC activities (which had provided the best outlet for social interaction, and provided real/reliable stability for a few years).  We do not have a diagnosis yet of any co-morbidities, although strong rejection sensitivity, perfectionism, etc and the usual associated consequences around self-perceived failures are definitely present.While responsive, the treatment team does not seem to be aware of virtual alternatives to supplement regular outpatient treatment (two hours of psychotherapy/wk and 3-4 expertly supported meals) virtually with an online teen peer support zoom/videochat group short of a ""full-day"" intensive outpatient program.  Given the perceived underlying causes of the eating disorder, we were hoping to incorporate (ideally expert supervised) virtual/zoom peer group for her that would also ameliorate and help her work on interpersonal dynamics and strategies in parallel with acceptance and hope, which would still allow her to attend school in person during the day. Weekend and nights would probably be ideal.  Is anyone aware of such virtual groups or other similar real-time social/peer ED support alternatives?Thanks in advance!",_admin_moderator,"Sun,11/08/2020-10:48pm",purplerosehope,"Hi purplerosehope, welcome to the forums.

16,tcamilot,08/19/2020,Help with ORTHOREXIA,"Hi, my daughter suffers from orthorexia for more than a year, and because she eats really healthy is more difficult to understand her eating disorder, but she burn all her calories doing exercise, running and any kind of work out that. She now needs to gain X pounds and her body is starting to make her feel weak. She's obsessed with what she eats, everything has to be measured and has to be healthy but we need her to understand she needs to decrease her activity and eat more and be more flexible.

17,km92653,09/05/2020,Are there any good FBT apps? ,"I am looking for a good FBT-friendly app to help me track my 16-yo daughter's food intake so she can gain weight. Is there such a thing? Here's the back story: She developed atypical anorexia at age 14 and began FBT shortly after turning 15. At age 16, she seemed to be stable and doing well in recovery, even though she was a little short of the goal weight. Unfortunately, her anorexia has become a pro at fooling herself, us and her therapist. We just found out she's been hiding food and skipping breakfast for months. She's now losing weight again. The biggest roadblock in her recovery is our inability to help her gain weight, even while monitoring X meals, X snacks. We spent many months in active therapy and were hardly able to get her to gain any pounds. We measured our success in ounces. To complicate matters, she's hyper-metabolic with multiple food sensitivities. I'm so tired and frustrated and overwhelmed by this disorder. I fear what will happen if she can't fully recover by the time she turns 18. That's less than a year and a half away. We're going to run back into therapy ASAP, but I need a way to make sure I'm getting enough calories in her to help her gain weight. Any advice?",_admin_moderator,"Sat,09/05/2020-3:33pm",Welcome!,"Hi km92653, welcome to the forums! We’re sorry your daughter has been struggling, but we are so glad you’re here.

18,iwanttolive,03/02/2020,Brutus94,"Hi.  This is iwanttolive.  I just want to check in to see how things are going?  As for me, I am really doing very well.  I hit a snag a few months back but overall I am  doing the best that I have ever done.  The depression is going away but I always have a low level, dysthymia, I am unsure of the spelling, but it is a low grade depression that doesn't go away.  I struggle with this, but the major depression is gone.   As well as the severe anxiety, but I still take a low dose anti-anxiety med for that.  But I am truly living and happy and engaged with life.  I say this to encourage you that even after one who had been as deathly ill as myself and had been to as many hospitals and programs as I have been to there is Hope.  I know you believe in and have faith in Jesus.  Never give up Hope.  My parent's didn't.  I didn't even though life was so excruciatingly difficult and painful for me.  I am healing and finally found the right therapist to help me work through some of the trauma.  My sister continues to be quite ill.  She is back in the hospital and will be going to a different hospital tomorrow.  Out of state.  She has an extremely complicated condition and most doctors don't know how to help her.  Unless God does a miracle she won't make it.  Even then, our faith and trust is in God and we continue to Hope.  It is difficult to watch as any illness is for any family member.  But with the eating disorder, there is just something about it that makes it really troubling to deal with.  Guilt, anger, shame, sadness.  So many more adjectives.  I deal with guilt and fear and anger with my sister as she hasn't always made the best choices for her health when she could have and now she is so ill.  But as for me and my healing, my parent's get a lot of credit for their unfailing love and never giving up on me.  They tell me they don't know if they always made the correct choices, should they have allowed me to live with them while ""acting out""?  They don't know, they only know they did what they thought was best and what they felt God wanted them to do.  We are very close and more so after I moved out of their home after staying with them  for six months due to some difficulties I was having with my sister.  Since coming back to my house, the issues I was having with my father resolved themselves.  I know it is difficult but keep hoping, keep believing and keep taking care of yourselves as you journey this road.  True recovery is possible.  I am at a good weight and am not afraid to eat and have even stopped the overeating I was engaging in for a while.  It feels good to be doing so well.  And I want to encourage others that it is real and possible.  Take care.iwanttolive",_admin_moderator,"Mon,04/13/2020-1:48pm","Dear iwanttolive, We would","Dear iwanttolive, We would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove references to specific Youtube channels, which are not allowed on the forums.

19,mjherman0712,06/08/2020,New here-seeking advice,"Hi All-
I am new here and really struggling.  My 17 y/o daughter has not been medically diagnosed but we are just so distraught over what to do for her.  She has been to therapists who have not really helped.  She won't admit there is a problem to anyone and believes we are crazy for thinking there is!  Her ED seems complex to me.  She sometimes binges, sometimes just doesn't eat, drinks excessive amounts of water and exercises excessively. SO much of her day is spent around obsessing of caloric intake and exercise.   The quarantine has not helped at all.  She has never weighed less than she does now, and she has always been petite. We notice some physiological symptoms in addition to her behaviors.  She is always cold, sometimes gets that blueness in her lips and hands that goes away, some fine hair noted on her skin, periods on and off.  She had a grand mal seizure in January for the first and only time in her life.  All neuro testing and cardiac testing came back normal but part of me wonders if an ED had anything to do with it.  It was a terrifying experience and I am just so afraid of something happeneing to her.  She is athletic which makes things more difficult especially with the exercise component.  I've been looking into treatment programs and found one that has inpatient, PHP and IOP.  I can't find any substantial reviews on it.  She refuses help and sure as her parents, we can force her there but will it work if it is done under full protest? Like if she can't acknowledge there is an issue, will it help?  I'm not even sure what I am necessarily asking but needed to share with someone who might understand.

21,brokenhearted,03/18/2020, new challenges with coronavirus/ support,"In light of the coronavirus, I expect that there may be new challenges for those out there with an ED. For example, with gyms closing, my 23 year old daughter is finagling whatever she can to get her exercise addition fix. She did manage to find one that is still in operation. Shame on them. It's hard to believe that gyms are not required to close as the bars and restaurants have been required. I'm guessing the struggle is real for anyone with an addiction at this point; no casino for the gambling addicts, no gyms for the exercise addicts, no bars for the alcoholics, etc. Just thought if anyone wanted to share struggles they are presently experiencing with the onset of this virus, perhaps we could support one another....
