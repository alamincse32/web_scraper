1,2Healthy4me,10/18/2020," My Slew of Daily Vitamins, and by the way, … i Feel Flat as an Emory Board...","So I had a rather efficient breakfast, and a nice beverage after awakening. Weighed myself 1st thing after relieving my bladder this morning. Feeling upset that my weight is still rising. I am trying so hard to keep physical while @ work, as well as for my daily walking routines, not over eating, and usually Not snacking on Hi Cal foods or snacks.But according to the d--- scale my body weight is resisting my need to feel in control of obesity. Last week couldn't walk due to my fall on the stairs. Then the heat kept me from walking earlier and it seems to get dark outside even though the temperature is finally at the level which I allow myself to do outdoor exercise at.
So, even that is out of my control. I messed up on doing a rather complicated register transaction so now my new employer told me to Not do the same transaction again. In a way that is a relief, as most the people who I ever have to deal with in doing returns always seem somewhat disgruntled upon entering the store, or returning out of retaliation or something regarding their feelings towards the people working here.I experienced  another shoplifter run out of the store again. Another assistant  manager screamed and gave verbal command to call the police in lieu of just Quietly and Discreetly calling them themselves. These people are paid a lot more than the regular cashier and stock staff. So I feel that they need to go through a security training on how t use smart phone technology to use them as they witness an event causing them to feel the need to chase and scream loudly in the store, which is stressful for me to deal with.My last job in retail always have had at least 1 security guard that was at the front door checking baggage of customers exiting daily from the store. It's requires at least 1 trained guard. Cashiers having to take attention off the customer being served is really annoying, and should really be unnecessary. Really, at least the managing staff should be as well versed on how to discreetly use smart phones for asset protection as they are trained to look up the price or location of the stock on sales floor.It can all be done with 1 store smartphone, but requires an additional training in the use of dialing out police, as well as in how to take discreet security photos to acquire proof of their accusations for yelling and chasing these locals out of the store swiftly....Now on 1st of a few days off from work and feel like if I don't eat until I'm stuffed as a bell pepper and feel pain in stomach to remind my self that I am still alive, though totally quiet and isolated at home here in my doll house like apartment. I am still sheltering from covid,  and avoiding neighborhood pools, malls, driving somewhere else other than being here at home alone paying bills, and doing online, fantasy,  ""window shopping""....Or Not eat all day and continue to feel numb and isolated.....like,  a Bad boy on house arrest.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,11/22/2021-10:33am","Hi boylejake, we would like","Hi boylejake, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove the outside link as well as the mention of specific food items since they could be triggering to other users and any kind of advice is not allowed on the forums.

I went from being an athlete and fun stay at home mom to barely able to lift my toddler and unable to work. I've been diagnosed with multiple autoimmune diseases as well as mitochondrial disease. I know my body needs more food to supply healing but I feel sick when I don't eat and sick when I do. I have to be on a restricted diet because my levels were toxic. I eat super clean but I also moderate food groups. I can get in my calories for the day and even then I feel overfill and sick. I'm so bloated and uncomfortable all the time. That's just the tip of the iceberg. I'm honestly afraid to try any sort of food because of how I may react and I don't want to feel worse. I have done different diets and food groups for years as well. No one has any answers. I want to get better. But I feel like my fear of food is out of control.

8,Braviary18,10/09/2021,Simple meal ideas?,"This is my first time posting on a forum like this, I'm really nervous to submit this but I'd really appreciate some help or feedback or even some kind words.I struggled with bulimia for a couple years in college. It started with dieting and counting calories until it progressed to throwing up almost all day long, everyday. I was always hungry and the only thing I could think about was what food I was going to eat next and how I would purge. I tried stopping at various times, but could never quite fully pull myself out of the hole I dug around me. I dated a few guys in that time and each time they found out, they were really angry with me and the relationship would end shortly after. I felt like a ticking time bomb.One day I started dating the guy of my dreams, a guy I had a crush on since I was 14 and it turned out he liked me the whole time too. I decided to fully quit bulimia. Of course I had some slip-ups in the first week of trying, but eventually I stopped puking. I had to learn how to eat fast and sugary food again without feeling sick. I had to learn how much food was a normal amount because I hadn't felt full in years. The first time I felt full and let myself digest my food I cried because it had been so long since I felt 'normal'.I started recovery on my own, but after I felt confident eating and digesting food I eventually told my boyfriend and he was perfectly wonderful about it. I had to teach him my needs, but he never made me feel bad. By the way, he lives in Massachusetts and I live in Texas. He FaceTimed me for every meal and told me I was beautiful and perfect every single time I started worrying about my weight.Over the summer I got a job in Massachusetts and lived with him in a tiny room in a house he shared with 4 guys. It was hard at first and there was even a time I almost gave up because he didn't understand I needed to eat at the same time everyday because otherwise I wouldn't eat at all. We talked it out and developed a plan. It ended up working out and I got used to living with the perfect, most loving, caring person.Summer ended and I had to go back to Texas for my last semester of college. I'm doing well in my classes because I don't skip and I always get my work done, but I'm struggling with eating again. For some reason almost all food looks gross to me. I don't think I'm eating nearly as much as I should be even though I'm really trying. I was really happy with my weight, but now I'm almost back to my high school weigh. I've never really struggled with anorexia before, but that seems to be my new problem. I'm not sure if it's because I'm sad from missing my boyfriend or scared of food because of my past relationship with it, but something's definitely wrong. I used to always be hungry and now I never am. Yesterday I felt sick while sitting at my computer, so I stood up and my vision went black at the edges. I crumpled to the floor and dropped everything in my hands and waited on the floor in the fetus position for the feeling to go away. I ended up taking a nap and ordering food for dinner and then sleeping very early. I feel alright now, but a little shaken. I think I'll feel better if I get back into a routine of eating at the same times everyday, but I've never been a very good cook and usually just ate microwavable meals. The problem is that type of food just looks gross to me now. I was hoping some of you might have some simple, fresh meal ideas for a recovering bulimic/possible anorexic that I could make easily. The less complex the better. Thank you for reading, sorry it's long.",_admin_moderator,"Sat,10/09/2021-1:47pm",welcome to the forums ,"Hi braviary18, welcome to the forums.

I just feel so upset with myself knowing that I have belly fat now because of my recovery weight gain and that I used to have a flat stomach that he will never get to see, even know he met and fell in love with me with the body I have now.

12,djinniboo,10/07/2021,I really need help..,"Hey guys...
I am a 47 year old anorexic woman. I had anorexia in my teens, which I had to be hospitalized for. I am normal height and I got down to a very low weight. At age 17, I got help and started recovery. I was under the assumption that I had fully recovered because I was able to eat intuitively throughout most of my adult life. But there were a few periods where I fell back into anorexic behavior, so my trajectory should not be too surprising.
2 years ago I got out of an abusive marriage. Like many people who suffer from eating disorders, I have experienced trauma. My parents were alcoholics, I was sexually and verbally abused and I have endured 3 divorces, not to mention the 6 divorces my mother went through while I was growing up. Stability was in limited supply and, put mildly, I have been through hell.
So, after the domestic violence incident in 2019, I spiraled back down into anorexia. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to find my way back out of it. I have a daughter, so I worry what influence this might have on her. I am currently receiving counseling but can't seem to stop. I count calories obsessively, overexercise, cut up my food, consume caffeine all day... you guys know how it goes. But I am angry at myself because, while I know that what I am doing is harmful and desperately want to stop...I just can't seem to.
I need help. This is impacting my ability to function. The only part of my life that seems to be thriving is my family life (for which I am grateful), but I wonder what affect this is having on them?
Incidentally, I am a very thin (but not dangerously underweight) woman, so no one outside of my family or therapist would suspect I struggle with this. Truth be told, I am of two minds. On an emotional level, being thin is satisfying. Note the word FEEL. It makes me FEEL attractive and FEEL like my life is in control. However, I KNOW (logically) that the feelings of control are an illusion, I KNOW that I am probably more attractive when my skin has color and I'm healthy and I KNOW that this is destroying me from the inside out. So, if I know this, why can't I stop?! This obsessive cycle comes at the cost of hurting my family, not to mention MYSELF. I always feel cold, I've lost so much hair, I am unable to sleep or concentrate and I'm destroying my body from the inside out. No one should feel happy when they see their ribs and chest bones! This is really difficult. I want to have my life back. I miss eating food and feeling FREE and happy.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,10/08/2021-2:15pm",Welcome Djinniboo ,"Welcome to the forums!

13,2Healthy4me,07/10/2021,My OB-GYN exam left me in a Bad Space yesterday..............,"Firstly, I went to see my OB-GYN yesterday. We discussed my fibroids. Good news is that they are smaller then when evaluated a few yrs ago. Then , of course, like every OB-GYN exam, which is always so intimidating to me. I Never have adjusted to this invasive type of annual exam.Good news is the Dr said that everything LOOKS OK but if begin having a severe period or painful abdominal that I must race to the ER where they may do a spring cleaning of my old lady parts and then that shall be the end of that problem once and 4 ALL.....The bad news is that I have gained a lot of weight since she saw me last. I felt Very Ashamed sitting naively and having this bad news thrust upon my ears and then my stomach began to tighten and I thought that I would race out to the nearest bathroom and purge. Secondly, it felt like my restricting ED was triggered all over again from the bearer of this scary, truthful news about my issue of having become overweight in the last few yrs since she had seen me last.I last saw her when I was at the ER for severe pain in my stomach. My med chart states that I actually had a diverticulitis flare up and was internally toxic. I felt so bad, the EMT had to remove my IV so I could run and throw up in the nearest bathroom. This rude woman blocked my entrance to the toilet and held a plastic bag for me to throw up into. I couldn't speak OBVIOUSLY-duh, so I had to go around her rude road block. It actually felt like such a relief to rid myself of these acute toxins from my belly. That day was the 1st time the OB-GYN came in to discuss my other problem currently haunting my womanly organs. Well, I am just a little more aware of my weight as I have now heard the real news that I have gained a new pet donkey, and lost my feeling of self control and this feels scary to me. Lastly, I am actually feeling more goal oriented to be careful of what I place into my mouth  and I'm sure I will be relapsing into a full fledged case of restricting behavior. I'm sure I will feel much better when the local pools re-open, and when I find a gym to tone and sculpt my muscles which were in great form just a year and a half ago.Oh well for now. The bitter Truth is Not sweet 4 me. The truth about my Covid weight gain feels like a fulcrum in my attempt to get healthy. Once I get the Go Ahead from the recreational facilities in my local area, I will be exercising once again.I hope that you all are working on your plans for achieving a healthier YOU and keep up the great work....",_admin_moderator,"Mon,07/12/2021-2:43pm","Dear 2Healthy4me, we would","Dear 2Healthy4me, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove language that could be triggering to other users.

18,kechull,09/15/2021,No Idea where to go for help,"I began seeking help back in April and because I work night shift, the residential program they were going to send me to had a hard time contacting me and bumped me off the list after two missed calls 30 minutes apart. I finally got back into the loop and had to get all my tests redone, which only made me feel invalid since I had shifted from UW to only slightly UW from daily b/p. There has been little to no follow up since I got my tests done and i haven’t been able to get a therapist either. I just don’t even know if I care anymore but I can’t keep cycling between too unhealthy to do the bare minimum at work and spending $50 on binge food in a single sitting.
I don’t know. I just am not having a great time and don’t even know what steps to take to make anything better. Ive tried calling the NEDA helpline or other behavioural health services in the area but no one is ever on the line and when i do get someone, i get directed to someone that’s “in a meeting and can’t speak to me right now but if I leave a message they will definitely surely 100% get back to me right away and definitely not delete my message and move on. i’m just even close to calling the suicide line to get any semblance of resources for me to go to.

19,philodendron.pal,09/13/2021,I've never thought about recovery before,"I feel like instead of working towards recovery, I've just settled on learning how to manage my disordered eating. Since middle school and being introduced to the food pyramid and food tracking, it was a downhill spiral from there and I started purging  + severely restricting what I ate. That was over 8 years ago, and now I've stopped purging (and I have gotten over some of my fear foods!), but I still can't stop myself for having these destructive thoughts about eating/me deserving to eat that cause me to just completely throw out a meal in the middle of cooking it or cry over the fact that I bought one type of food instead of another. I acknowledge that I use restriction as a way of harm towards myself as well. I've been to therapy before about anxiety and other issues, but I never fully brought up my ED because I thought ""I need to get through my other problems first"" or because the therapists I've been to specialize in something else I was struggling with. I've also had super bad experiences with therapists lately where they seem frustrated with me, so I'm scared for a bit.The only reason I bring all this up now is because I know that my friend has been struggling with their body image, and I have no idea how to comfort them or the right things to say and I'm scared about making things worse or watching them spiral into an ED. I've talked about body neutrality with them, but I don't think that's helpful. I'm even scared just to tell them fully that I've struggle with an ED because I know for me, competition is a big driver (ex: ""they didn't eat today, so I shouldn't"") and I don't want to trigger them in anyway or shift focus away from them in any way. I also know how useless it can be to hear ""oh but you're beautiful!"" when talking about your body, cause our thoughts are so persistent.how can I help my friend + how can I help myself?

21,kcporter6,08/20/2021,dreading life without an ED,"Simple version: I want to want to recover. But I also want to stay sick. I've seen people say ""I don't want to shrink myself"" or ""I want to live my life"" and I want to feel like that but I don't. Did something change for them? or are they just faking it to make it?Long version: I have no idea how to WANT to recover. My family has pushed/forced me in the past, but ultimately I ignore them. People have told me that I have an eating disorder, but I stay seeking validation, looking for ""sick enough"". I don't want to burden the people around me with the bullshit that comes along with EDs, but I'd still rather be dying than recovering. I want to want to be better. I don't know how to recover with so little motivation or self-esteem (but not none). I don't have hopes or dreams to come back to, I don't want to face life without my eating disorder. Currently I'm using excuses. I'm not severely restricting like I was, it's not that bad, it's under control, it's just dieting, etc etc etc etc etc. I keep saying I am just fine with living with an eating disorder for the rest of my life, that nobody will be able to help because I don't even want to help myself. But a teeny, tiny part of me knows that long-term EDs are not ideal. They are the opposite of ideal. I don't want to be sick but it's the easiest thing I know. Additionally, a little bit unrelated, I was diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder a little while ago, and knowing it commonly co-occurs with eating disorders, I wanted to start a discussion. I feel like if I give up an eating disorder, I'll have to adopt a new self-destructive habit like alcohol abuse. It's like I don't know how to cope with my own life. If anyone has any advice or comments, I would so appreciate it!!

22,struggling_mom,08/02/2021,struggling w/ no family/support system,"Hello,
I truly appreciate the opportunity to be heard. I have had an eating disorder since age 14. I am now 27 with two young children. I was very very sick before I got pregnant with my first child. I had tried multiple eating disorder centers. even flying myself to other states because i didn't trust myself to stay. I'm a chronic bad patient, checking in and out depending on my emotions. It's so hard getting help as an adult, because when the eating disorder voice saying ""I don't want to be here"" kicks in, there's nothing to stop you from leaving treatment. I feel that most people have family support throughout their treatment. But I had no one pushing me to stay or get help. My fiance at the time watched my health decline and it got to the point where I knew no one was going to save me. I found a lovely counselor who specializes in eating disorders, I was able to get healthy. And almost immediately got pregnant once at a healthy weight.This is where I felt my eating disorder was ""cured""
when I was pregnant, I knew the babies health was too important to restrict. I finally had a good appetite, my pregnancy brain was protecting me from depression. I was looking forward to this new life.
Of course this was very naive. Now with my second child almost 2 years old. I'm falling back into old habits. using restricting as a coping skill to deal with the depression from lack of family support. my families Lack of concern about my health (mentally and physically). self destructing slowly and quietly. I was brought up in a family where you keep your problems quiet.
It makes me sad that this has happened before, and I still feel shame in asking for help. How could I be so selfish? why haven't I ""grown up"" yet?
I have panic attacks, extreme anxiety to the point I can't work. I've been denied disability, and I feel like caring for my children just isn't enough.
I'm currently in college, but still don't feel like i'm doing enough. What breaks my heart is my fear of losing control again. becoming so sick that I can't care for my children properly. I care about them more than I care about myself, which is probably part of the problem. my self worth has always been low. How do you get into recovery with noone supporting you? not even your significant other?
is it reasonable to expect him to help me when we're both dealing with working and caring for kids?
This was why I never succeeded in typical recovery centers. I don't want help from a rotating shift of strangers. I want people who actually care. but they just don't exist. its so depressing.how would I fit recovery into my busy mom schedule?
I'm afraid of the future after recovery, how am I going to wake up, get me and my kids ready and out the door, work an 8 hour shift, come home, cook dinner, get them ready for bed etc?
I've been in therapy for years but still feel I have no good coping skills. Nothing works for me.It all seems like too much. I love my children, but I feel like a horrible mother for having this problem.
I'm extremely resentful toward my family for making me feel like I need to suck it up and never complain.
I don't have the energy to do the things I want to do. I don't feel loved. I don't feel worthy of anything. I don't enjoy hobbies. My fear and obsession with food is consuming my life again. Id love to just have someone to talk to about this stuff, without judging or assuming I want attention (which is another fear i have about talking about it)Does anyone else feel like this? Am I the only adult who still feels like a child inside my body? forced to go through the motions but knowing everything might come crashing down at any moment.To whoever is reading this,
Thank you for thinking of me.

23,Immacoolgirl,09/06/2021,Tired of doing this to myself,"Please help me! So I’ve been bulimic since I was younger but I recently gained what I consider to be a lot of weight, and I told myself that I would lose the weight I gained by making myself throw up. I am obsessed with getting down to a specific weight and I have been doing this to myself for (maybe 9 months on and off) 40 days straight. At first the binges and purges were easy.. but now I feel my body struggling. I have chest pains during this, and just recently I have been urinating on myself every time I purge. I am frightened that this is still not enough to convince me to stop. I want help, but I’m also afraid of keeping food down for fear of gaining the weight I have lost back. I am so scared I have decided to reach out for help here. Why am I urinating on myself? What’s causing this chest pain? Is my body finally giving up because I mistreated it for so long?

25,seekingchange,08/31/2021,I don't know who to tell,"I was 8 when my sister was diagnosed with anorexia. My family life became a living hell and it genuinely ruined our lives for years and my family is still broken from the effects the illness had on my sister. She's now 23 (was diagnosed at 12) and is still suffering. I'm now in college and am pretty positive that I have anorexia. My sister was extremely skinny and I am not underweight so my family doesn't worry about my health. I don't want to tell my family because I am ashamed that after these years of my sister's suffering that now I've developed one too. And I don't want to tell my college friends because I don't want them to police my eating. But I worry about myself. I don't eat at all like I used to. I am scared of so much food and I try and eat as little as possible every day. But I came back to college after the summer having lost a lot of weight and I got so many compliments :(. Everyone is telling me I look so skinny and that my abs look so good and that I look so hot in my bikini. I don't know how I'm ever gonna be okay gaining weight. I just don't know who could possibly help me. I don't think I could ever tell my parents, who are still taking care of my sister, that I now need help too. And I don't want my college friends, who already are a bit concerned about me, because they personally are not okay with being around disordered eating as girls who have struggled with food themselves. When one of our friends started eating less and less, they expressed that it was hard for them to be around, and we aren't friends with her anymore, whether that's the reason I am not sure. I just feel trapped. There's really no one I can tell, and I love the way my body looks.

26,silverstars,08/29/2021,Out of treatment & struggling...,"I was in inpatient treatment for almost 6 weeks and got home just over a month ago.
I did really well there.I gained the weight.I didn't struggle there with my meals or snacks at all.I was really motivated and felt so strong.I did a lot of hard work in CBT and DBT.When I got home I set up an appointment with a private dietician (whom i can't really afford,nor can i afford her prescribed meal plan).I was supposed to have had an appointment with her on the 4th of September but have already abandoned that idea.I haven't been eating at all the way I learned to in treatment.They told me to keep weighing myself,that it would be important for my pyschiatrist and dietcian (Both of whom I only can have appointments over the phone with due to covid so can't be weighed in their offices.) to know my weight and important for ME to know my weight-
So I have been weighing myself twice a week on the same days as i was being weighed in treatment.To be honest,I haven't been at all triggered by the number,but I am triggered by the changes in my body.I haven't really been eating meals,just snacking or bineging.Part of the reason for this is ever since I got home my GAD and OCD have been overwhelming me,and anxiety tends to steal my appetite.Yesterday i had a very bad anxiety attack and really had to force myself to eat just a very little bit.This morning I have kept telling myself I need to eat breakfast but I haven't.And I found myself looking at the calories on an item without really meaning to.It also occurred to me to weigh myself,when I am not supposed to weigh myself until tomorrow.All in all getting into dangerous territory.Already.I am so ashamed of myself.I was just in the ER the other day with a very bad anxiety attack and suicidal ideation and my OCD was so intense but they would not help me.I also had called a crisis line that morning but the guy wasn't helpful at all either really.These experiences have made me hesitate to seek out help in the future.In the ER the pysch resident asked me how I was doing with my anorexia,and I told her I wasn't actively trying to lose weight-I'm not-(At least not yet) but that I have a voice in my head sometimes that tells me i am not allowed to eat.(Not an auditory hallucination,but,you know,that eating disorder ""voice."")I know I should be eating even when I don't feel hungry-I don't want to continue with the dietcian or her meal plan.It was both a very overwhelming and expensive meal plan.My GP arranged for me to have free supplements but I haven't even been drinking those.My weight has been going up and down over the past few weeks.I don't understand.i did so well in treatment.I came home on a ""high"" as my pyschiatrist said.Now I have fallen so far even though i am still,at least not conciously,trying to lose weight.In treatment i was told not to let more than four hours go by without eating.Well I quite frequently find I have done just that.At first this was truly anxiety driven but now i fear it has become a way of coping again.And a focus for my OCD apart from my other disturbing obsessions.I don't know what I am looking for here exactly.I really just needed to get this out somewhere.My pyschiatrist is also my therapist and i have been being honest with him about this but as of this week he doesn't know how bad it has gotten.Anyway...I am sorry,this has been way too long a post.Thank you for reading if you have.Oh I have so much shame over this...",_admin_moderator,"Mon,08/30/2021-11:05am",silverstars,"Hi silverstars, we are sorry to hear about this challenging time.

I was lucky enough to get a nutritionist and I had a good three weeks of bliss. I was eating enough, I wasn't fasting, and I was finally able to get back to the gym, fitness being a life-long passion for me. However, the stress of moving out and actually being in college seemed to be too much. I binged hardcore before coming, and I've binged hardcore since. I keep having thoughts telling me to fast for days at a time and have to actively have my mom call me to make sure I eat on the days I'm not binging. I find myself at my university's gym working for hours and hours trying to get any calories off. It's already causing me difficulty in my classes, I feel totally overwhelmed and like I'm drowning. I can't stop bodychecking and comparing myself to others. I have no idea how to bring myself out of this cycle. Is there anyone else who relapsed going to college? How did you get yourself out of it?

30,ariannag,08/10/2021,Trying to be healthy but keep getting triggered ,"Not to sound too grim or pessimistic but I feel pretty hopeless about ever recovering from my eating disorder(s). Over quarantine I actually lost some weight in a healthy manner (eating clean and working out), however over the past couple of months I’ve fallen off my “health kick wagon” due to what I believe is burnout. I have received help for BED in the past but I think I also live with orthorexia. This makes my idea of what’s healthy for me very confusing and although I don’t restrict calories in a highly restrictive way, I still feel urges to binge like I’m starving when I’m not that hungry. Sometimes I “allow” myself to/justify my binges as a way to challenge my orthorexia mentality but then this just enables my binge episodes. It’s a confusing way to live for me because my ultimate goal is food freedom, intuitive eating, and a strong body but lately I’m caught between eating clean to reach my health goals but also not eating clean so I don’t fall back into my severe orthorexia self. I’ve also tried to practice having “non-clean” food in small amounts throughout the week but it just leads me to throw in the towel and eat all the highly processed food until i get sick. I just feel exhausted with this constant mental battle I’m in and it doesn’t help that I don’t talk about these things with anybody ever so it’s always bottled up. It’s leaving me at a point of sadness and emptiness and while I don’t think I have depression, I am nervous this will eventually turn into it. I really hate that I am an indecisive chronic dieter who wants to have a very slim body but also loves to eat.

34,wheezing,07/27/2021,Actually trying to recover,"Okay so I'm seventeen and my family doesn't believe eating disorders exist so I don't actually know what I have-- but I know it's not nothing. Basically-- I don't eat. Most of the time it's not conscious-- like I don't think ""Don't eat that!"" I just... don't eat. But then I go into a funk-- usually triggered-- where I do it intentionally. Recently I got home from a month visiting family on the other side of the US and found out my mom's doing keto to lose weight. Honestly, it kinda got to me. Usually I would make dinner for the household when my dad's working but now she can't eat certain things so she has to make her own food-- and my siblings only eat chicken nuggets so I was on my own. So I consciously didn't eat. Between my mom and boyfriend both trying to lose weight it started to get me really bad-- and then my parents noticed I'm severely underweight. The past couple days it got real bad, I started compulsively weighing myself and meticulously counting my calories (something I've literally never done) and yesterday was just... horrible... I cut back my usual calories, completely ghosted my boyfriend, lied to literally everyone saying I already ate-- etc etc. I'm leaving out some things but you get the gist. I want to get better and actually better this time-- I want to be able to pick up my two year old brother without struggling or be able to run down the street without dying... My goal includes muscle of course, but I need help. I'm not sure where to go. I can't make myself eat that much without feeling like I'm gonna vomit. I've been pushing myself and I feel terrible. Any help or advice would be amazing!I can't go to a doctor or anything cause of my parents-- but I have a boyfriend and two best friends who may not get it but they really do try/",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/28/2021-2:34pm",welcome! ,"Welcome to the forums Wheezing!

38,Nishita ,07/17/2021,Lacking support,"am a seventeen year old girl from and Indian household. I am what I consider a pretty healthy weight but nevertheless, I am put on a diet recently along with vigorous exercise training. I love to eat food and I eat decently like under control but this diet doesn’t have a thing that I like and it’s very strict, my father made it himself. I want to get fitter and I am ready to work on it but I just hate the schedule, it’s like a third class weight loss plan. My father blackmails me saying that if I don’t follow it, he won’t take me to the gym. I love myself but they are so judgemental about everything that I eat and have always been. Even as a child below 10, I remember sneaking and keeping things in place so that I won’t be questioned even when I have never been overweight in my life. I have just stopped eating because of all this, I don’t want to eat anything like this, it’s better to eat nothing. I have a sweet tooth and I can’t eat sweets at all, I don’t have any problem with that but they should at least be considerate of my feelings and not eat them right in front of me while making tasty noises. Even before all this, whenever we got something that I liked, they said oh! Nishita doesn’t want to eat this which made all my appetite go down the drain. It’s okay to make fun but they did it every time which really hurt me and now because if the COVID situation here in India and all, I have been living with these monsters for 1.5 years. Even now where I don’t want to eat anything they first urge me to eat and then I deny so even if I grab something, they go you are not taking it to eat right, don’t eat anything. They are so heartless and emotionless. I don’t know how to help myself and I hate myself so much for that. #eatingdisorder",_admin_moderator,"Mon,07/19/2021-1:30am","Hi Nishita, welcome to the","Hi Nishita, welcome to the forums. We edited your post slightly to remove height and weight numbers and mentions of specific food items, which are not allowed on the forums – you can review our community guidelines here. We are sorry to hear about what is going on with your family.

40,hozi3r,07/16/2021,trying to overcome bulimia,"i've contemplated a lot on whether or not i should join an online forum, but i figured it might help seeing other individuals go through the same or at least, similar situations that i am currently in. i've struggled with bulimia ever since the pandemic started. in prior to that, i was actually anorexic at the age of 13. i started to get better two years after, but when the pandemic hit, my ED shifted to bulimia. im currently 16. my birthday was a couple months ago in january. my parents found out at the time that i have been vomitting out food and they took me to a psychiatrist. she asked for a quick internal scan of my organs and i found out that my ED was already damaging my liver, kidney and heart. i was in treatment for about a month, and somewhere during mid-february, i had breakfast with my mom and then i fainted and was hospitalized because of malnutrition. i've been in recovery for about 4-5 months, but i'm back at home now. i was unable to do any of my school work and exams due to the extreme lack of energy. i got better for a few weeks and now i'm back in a cycle of eating and purging and i don't have the courage to tell my parents because i know they will condemn me for it. they believe that treatment is really expensive and i feel guilty asking for help from my own parents. they're not the best support system to begin with and i don't really have any friends who can relate to this. in all honesty, i'm not quite sure if anyone will be able to help or to respond- but i figured sharing my experience anonymously might help lift the burden of secretly still struggling with bulimia.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,07/16/2021-2:07pm",Welcome! ,"Welcome Hozi3r to the forums!

41,kcporter6,07/16/2021,i hate therapy and i hate doctors,"Most of the time, I want to be sicker and I want my eating disorder to be worse. But sometimes I see what I am doing and I realize it won't last forever and I'm ruining my life. I decide I want to change and get better. And for the most part I've made progress, I eat relatively normally, my weight fluctuates but much less so. But my depression and anxiety are still so bad that I wish I could fade away. Commit slow, silent suicide. I know I have other problems but I can't bring myself to work on them. I was in therapy for six months but I didn't feel like I was getting anywhere and I quit. My therapist was 24 and brand new (I was her first client) and I'm still not sure if she wasn't experienced enough for me, or it was my lack of effort that hindered me. I started with an eating disorder dietician but I hate that, too. In order to use her services, I have to want to abandon my ED, and I don't want to. She also said something along the lines of ""It seems like you know everything you need to do"" which I have done some serious overthinking on. If I know everything, then why do I need her? My parents are paying for my therapy, but I'm an adult so I have to make my own decisions but they're heavily influenced. My mom says I need to stick with nutrition therapy before I quit again, but at the same time, was very frustrated a few months ago when I wasn't magically normal after a month or two of talk therapy. I'm stuck because I don't have anyone to talk to and the eating disorder just makes me feel less alone, but I can't or won't seek out help because it went poorly the first time. I recognize I have privilege to even have this problem, I know other people have to recover by themselves because they have no other option.

42,kcporter6,07/14/2021,choosing recovery for me,"I am having a really hard time working on my issues. I'm an adult so my therapists have told me I have to make my own decisions, but I'm also young and I'd rather have my mom do everything for me. I've lost a lot in the last 6 months of pseudo-recovery, including everyone who supported me because I have basically ghosted them. I quit regular therapy and I've been trying to quit nutrition therapy and now it is only more apparent that living in these conditions isn't sustainable. My nutrition therapist said at one point that I ""already know pretty much everything I need to do"" which I have definitely read too far into, but I can't stop thinking that I am causing all of my problems because I like being difficult. I regret quitting therapy because it was impulsive, but now I don't feel like I can go back because money is already an issue. I'm just at a loss because I am ok with living with a mild eating disorder, but my family isn't. At the same time, my family puts no effort into helping me recover, and my mom constantly refers to my mental health issues as a burden. At this point I have no one else in my life, I might as well recover to get them off my case, but I don't want to recover for myself. Do I go back to therapy even though I didn't make much progress before? Do I start over with a new therapist?

45,Pheonixfly28,07/06/2021,Starting recovery from anorexia help...,"I have just officially started recovery from anorexia, and I am having a very difficult time justifying my eating in my head. I personally find that when I allow myself to eat foods like when I'm on vacation, or out for dinner with friends or family etc. I can't stop eating and I have to mentally pull myself back. I also have these thoughts of not wanting to recover ""too fast"" I am unsure why this matters to me so much but it does. I also don't want to recover in summer as I want to be able to eat what I want during the holidays and my birthday which is in December. I'm terrified of gaining weight and gaining back all I lost and possibly more, and from what I've heard you gain weight faster in recovery because your metabolism is messed up and other reasons. I haven't even been sick for a year yet, but I am in treatment with a team, my doctor also tells me I'm sick, but I don't believe them almost? When I start to feel better about eating also all I want is junk food and I just want to eat heaps of it constantly, is this normal? Do I eat it? I am so lost and confused.

47,emma11207,07/04/2021,Feeling as if my ED is not valid or not valid enough,"hi all, i just recently created an account here and am really struggling. i find i feel as if i don't ""look"" like i am struggling with an eating disorder or i don't look like how the media portrays eating disorders, therefore, i feel like i should not seek out help and take it from others. i feel consumed by food and calories every single day and i don't know where to begin. im a competitive college athlete and working out is apart of my daily routine, but it is to the point of working towards exhaustion and i feel when I don't workout i am failing both my team and myself. i also feel as if the amount of calories i consume per day is dictated by the calories i burn through vigorous exercise. My weight is technically in a ""healthy"" zone, but i have acknowledged I have an issue with myself, but to others, I seem perfectly ""fine."" does anyone else struggle with this? i am so terrified of gaining weight but other days i give up and overeat to the point of feeling sick and the next day i eat too little and the next day I could eat too much and feel awful and the cycle continues on. I just want to feel healthy and happy again. thank you for reading.emma",_admin_moderator,"Mon,07/05/2021-11:03am",emma11207,"Hi emma11207, welcome to the forums!

48,healn,04/24/2021,early recovery,"the pant. when i was working hard, walking everywhere, nourishing my body and in a steady cycle of binge and purge, which i now call the old 'happy' hour, i got pants that fit my body then. now none of them fit. i feel frustrated, body shame and the drive to fit into them again and the urge to binge and purge out of anxiety over the button about to pop. top it off with chastising myself for subjecting myself to putting the pant on at all. i've gone to this 'unhappy' hour these past few months.my recovery self reframes and says, it's not that you don't fit into the pants, it's that the pants don't fit your body. and that's a-ok. or get new pants? so i got ones that fit, even love and wear them now. this small act of self-body loving does help me, which i know is big in recovery, for good reason, but more than that, i'm looking at my whole damn closet filled with emotional pants.i do not yet know what to do but i know for sure it is anxiety and perfectionism stacked high. it is not that wishing my body fit loosely into the pant again or making it my goal in itself is an eating disorder behavior. i start to see, it is ruminating on it. shaming myself into motivation. disciplining my body to a brink to get there. doing this feeds an insatiable anxiety. it's pants, but could just as well be another issue. i'm recovering from anxiety disorder, which happens to revolve around body/ food/ mood. right now all i need to do is name it. sit with my feelings. see myself and others. what have others experienced around clothes and what helps you?",_admin_moderator,"Mon,05/31/2021-8:16am",spider.web,"Hi spider.web, thanks for reaching out to the forums. We slightly edited portions of your comment to remove mentions of a specific medication name and the name of a specific video channel.

I don’t know if as I eat more that will go away but I always take it too far when exercising and eating fear food without working out is freaking me out and scaring me. U made new friends at church who are super supportive of my recovery but they’re wanting to bring some of the snacks I used to love before my ED to celebrate my 2 months in recovery and I don’t know how I’m gonna handle it because a lot of the food are fear foods.

It started about 15 months ago, when I decided (after a traumatic event) to eat myself to death. I started seeing a therapist in January, and that helped, but stopped going after I got Covid in March. But as I'm wondering to my self just why the hell I keep eating until I'm so full I'm miserable, or why I keep eating in a way that makes me gain even more weight when the Dr. just told me I'm pre-diabetic, it occurs to me that I'm back to square one. Eating to hurt myself. I'm not hungry. I'm never hungry. But I eat and eat and eat until it hurts. Do other people do this? Can I actually eat myself to death?

It really began at the start of quarantine and has kind of gone up and down since then. Some days I feel fine and then other days, eating is really a struggle. I go though periods where i feel normal, then other times i am consumed by urges to restrict my food, and then other times where i feel like i am out of control around it. When I am restricting, like right now, almost nothing seems ok to eat, no matter what it is. It feels like there is some overwhelming mental block. I pick up the food and feel like I just can’t do it. However, often times I still am able to force myself to eat eventually or the feeling goes away just enough that I am able to get myself to eat. So, physically, I appear healthy. However, I am actually really struggling.

Now two months later, I am back to a lower weight than my admission into php. My doctor wants to refer me to other programs but I just know that at the moment I want to do this on my own terms. Where i live there are 6+ month long waitlists for any programs which has made getting help really difficult. Does anyone have any tips of sustaining long term recovery.

56,Emoryann,06/07/2021,All Alone and Need Help,"Hi,
So I haven't ever been diagnosed with anything, but basically my deal is that I have an intense fear of eating in public, and I have ""safe people"" and ""safe places"" where I can eat, but they're pretty limited, and it's making me miserable. I also skip meals a lot, and I tried purging for a while, but it didn't go so well, so I don't do that anymore, but I restrict a lot, and I exercise. I'm also terrified of appearing “fat,” and for 2 1/2 years I wore really baggy and large clothing to hide. I'm working on that last one though, I got some crop tops that I like and I'm trying to work my way up to a bathing suit for summer, but I don't know if I'm ready yet. Anyways, the thing that really bothers me though is my mom (I'm 14) because I do all that stuff, and she doesn't notice a thing. I also harm myself in other ways (I'm working on that too) and she didn't notice that either. And it wouldn't bother me so much except she's constantly talking to me about my two little sisters, and she always worries about them and wether or not they have body issues, and it just makes me nuts because they are so confidant, and my middle sister rocks bikinis every year, (not to say she can't or doesn't have body issues, but that if she does, they aren't obvious) and I couldn't even put on a bathing suit last year, and she's still worried about them. And I know I should cut her some slack because she has mental health issues of her own, and she's really struggling right now, but I'm so tired of trying to support her, my sisters, and myself. Anyways, thats why I haven't gotten any help, because I can't talk about it, and she doesn't notice anything, and I don't know what to do.

65,yafashelli123,05/07/2021,"I want a diagnosis, but I don't want to tell my parents","I have been struggling for about eight months now, which doesn't feel real. I am technically at a healthy weight, which makes me think that I am not sick enough for anyone to believe me if I tell them. I just want the validation of a diagnosis, and I want some form of treatment to get me out of this mindset, yet the thought of treatment terrifies me, because I will have no control over anything anymore. All I want is a diagnosis to validate me, but if they diagnose me, will I be sent into treatment against my will? How do I even get a diagnosis without my parents knowing? I just want the diagnosis without my parents, and to move on and not go to treatment. Is that possible? Of course being recovered sounds like a dream, but nothing scares me more than the thought that I won't have any control. I have recovered from laxative abuse because a friend helped me to finally do it after months. I am grateful for that, but the fact that I did that makes me think I am not sick enough. Everything else I am going through STILL like with eating feels so illegitimate because of my weight. Even the one friend I told doesn't fully believe it's a problem because I ""look healthy"". It constantly makes me feel like I am not doing enough to be sick enough for this to be a valid problem. I always feel that I need the validation that this is real, but once this friend did suggest it might be a real problem, suddenly I was quick to shut them down because this isn't a big ENOUGh issue.

66,RoseyDanes,05/06/2021,Worried about the future,"I cannot afford treatment. My boyfriend is locked in another country because of Covid. We are trying to do everything long distance, he is my only support. I work for someone who won't pay me. Been in denial that things are quite bad. Last fall I called the eating disorder hotline after my boyfriend begged me to, and was advised to go to the emergency room. Though I was given a drip, they were unable to give me more care apart from emergency blood work that I still haven't been able to pay for. When referred to a doctor, they told me that without insurance, my only hope was to pay out of pocket for eating disorder treatment, which they could not refer me to because of lack of insurance. I was homeless, living out of my car at the time. There's more but I can't really get into it, mostly because this is crappy enough. I worry sometimes that I will maybe die soon from this.

For the last 3 years I have been eating complete meals and snacks but I know I’m not eating enough, and my resting metabolism is running very slow (had it measured)
I am a week in to going ‘All In’ as I read this can repair the metabolism. I am at a loss about how much I should eat though as the women in the stories I have read about began their recovery at a very low weight.
Does anyone know roughly what I should eat as someone who is already at a healthy weight?
I have spoken with a dietitian and they just said to eat without restriction but the thing is I’ve eaten so little for very long that if I didn’t pay attention to my eating I would probably still be under eating without realising.

I'm so tired of feeling this way, and really want to gain weight and start recovery again.
I don't want my ED to ruin my present and future anymore.
I've tried to recover several times now, but every time I end up getting nowhere.
It's so so frustrating. I feel like I am trapped in my own head.
I am getting help from professionals, and my parents at home are truly the best support I could wish for, I don't understand why I still feel this way.I don't know whether I should follow my meal plan again, which I have previously followed obsessively and I feel like has ruined my relationship with food even more, but it gave me the security I needed. 
I have mentally grown so much since my recovery (talking about feelings and so on), yet when it comes to food and weight, I am at the exact same place as before.
This is so frustrating, and I just feel lost.

76,fl0werfabi,04/15/2021,newbie:) just some questions/rant,"hi yall! im new here, ive been lurking for a few years but i never made an account until now. i dont know if i have an eating disorder or not. ive never been diagnosed with one, i have been to therapy but only briefly as i didnt like my therapist and he only barely focused on my social anxiety and nothing else.
just as a little info dump, ive always had a weird relationship with food. i think as a kid i showed many many symptoms of arfid but was never diagnosed, and now that's turned into another thing, whether or not its a disorder is unknown to me.
i always have such intrusive thoughts, mainly surrounding myself. from what i've deeply researched about eds, i check all the boxes, but im scared to tell anyone. no one in my family knows, but other people, including my boyfriend, tell me how they're concerned with my eating behaviors. i don't know what to do, and i dont know if this is something i need to worry about or not. i almost dont want to know if i should do something about it, its almost as if i dont want it to leave. its been with me for so many years, and as weird as it sounds, its so comforting to me because of how consistent its been there, even if it physically hurts my body.

79,f1utterbymo,04/14/2021,took an Rx I knew would make me sick to lose menopause weight,"I just got home from the emergency room. I was there for 4 hours.
I drove myself while on the phone trying not to freak out about
tightness in my chest that I knew was a bowel obstruction pushing
up on my diaphragm but my doctor was afraid it could be a heart event. they hooked me up to EKGs, took blood, X-rayed my chest, did a CT scan with
contrast while I told them, ""guys -- it's an intestinal blockage.
I can't go to the bathroom without extra help. I just need to know what to do now to fix it""2020 Gynocologist put me on medications because of miserable hot flashes and insomnia. it was so bad I was losing my voice from lack of sleep and I had to teach singing on Zoom for 6 hours a day and record virtually. He said it was the perfect cocktail, and with the pandemic lock down, it would keep me calm and focused. Then the magic words: ""This medication will keep you from gaining menopause weight"". I was  noticing I was gaining. Magic. So I took it. One month in -- IMPACTED. Please don't make me explain if you don't know what it is. You can google it. I got a rectocele and my vaginal wall started falling out of me. I was terrified. But I decided to take over the counter remedies so I could fight the constipation and stay on the medications. I ended up on the emergency room dehydrated and ketonic. I stopped the medication. And gained water weight and with swollen knees and ankles went back again to emergency because the veins in my legs were throbbing and swollen from edema. OMG -- I got back on the medication. Lost the weight. Great -- constipated again...it has been a horrible endless circle. But I not only have a history of bulimia, but 3 Crohn's disease surgeries behind me and intestinal damage from that. I KNOW BETTER. But all I can think about is losing weight and looking hot over 50 because I am a recording artist and former pinup model and I emcee shows with 1920s style burlesque dancers. I hate that I think I am overweight -- so feeling overweight is the worst. I'm so embarrassed and sad....I KNOW BETTER.

82,xellex1987,04/08/2021,Blood Monitoring,"Hi all,Firstly, I am so grateful to have found this forum. I am currently feeling extremely confused and anxious about the recovery process. I will try and explain as best I can and I apologise in advance for the wordiness but I will try and keep it as straight forward as possible.I have been receiving outpatient treatment for a few months now. From my first appointment, I was directed to aim for the obvious thing - to generally eat a lot more than I had been with a particular focus on increasing my carbohydrate intake. Despite under-eating and being restrictive with certain elements of my diet, I have always eaten at regular points throughout the day and have always eaten carbohydrates, albeit very small portions of them. I was told that it was okay for me to not have regular blood tests as I am extremely needle phobic and therefore even the mention of one raises my stress levels hugely.I had made a good start in increasing my intake but a few weeks into it, I changed my anti-depressant medication which caused some bad side effects and resulted in me ending up having to go to hospital to be checked over. They gave me a blood test there and told me that the only thing they could see was slightly out of range were my phosphate levels which were a little bit low, but nothing to worry about.Since then, my clinic have completely changed their approach with me. They have told me to continue taking phosphate supplements as well as refeeding supplements. One clinician I saw told me I should not increase my calories at all until I had had further blood tests, and to specifically make sure I did not increase my carbohydrate intake. For someone with a restrictive eating disorder, this did not feel like helpful advice, but I understood their concerns of refeeding syndrome (despite appearing to fall into the low risk category) so I followed their advice. I also agreed to continue having twice weekly blood tests during the first few weeks of taking the supplements and was told that once I had completed these blood tests and all was okay, I would not be required to have such regular monitoring.Throughout the last few weeks, I have been in a constant state of anxiety due to worrying about the blood tests. I have been surviving on a few hours broken sleep a night and my appetite is even worse than normal. I feel constantly sick and my heart is pounding 24/7. My personal GP has voiced his concerns about the regularity of these tests impacting me negatively in other ways. Since the blood tests commenced, I have actually lost weight, despite eating more (as supported by my mother).All of my blood tests have come back generally within range, with a few things being slightly out, but my GP has assured me that these are to be expected with the stress I am under and the process that my body is going through with eating more, and he has said it is nothing of high concern and everything should level out.HOWEVER! (thank you if you are still reading this!!) My clinic contacted me earlier and informed me that their GP would like me to continue having weekly blood tests, especially while I am taking phosphate supplements. Since Tuesday morning, when I was initially told it would be my last blood test, life has felt much easier - I have slept better, eaten better and do not feel my heart racing like it has been. But the second I heard I was expected to have more tests, all those horrible feelings came back.I do not want to undermine the GP at the clinic as I do appreciate their monitoring of me, but I also have a strong feeling that all of this is really hindering my progress with ED recovery right now and I don't see how I'm going to progress whilst having these continuous tests. My question is: does anyone have any knowledge of the importance of having such regular tests and the likelihood of things deteriorating to the point of being medically compromised to the point of danger? I understand this is similar to the question ""how long is a piece of string?"" but I suppose I am just looking for reassurance. I went for 9 years without any monitoring and nothing awful happened so I am inclined to refuse the blood tests. However, I do not want to reject the only external support I am currently receiving, but at the same time, it seems questionable whether to continue when all they seem to be doing is causing me insane amounts of stress and confusing right now with all the contradictory advice I am receiving (and also no explanation behind their advice!)Has anyone embarked upon recovery without regular medical monitoring? Or has anyone arranged their own monitoring to be carried out via their doctor on a more infrequent basis? Just to say also that as much as I wish I could, I know that I am mentally incapable of increasing by a huge amount of calories at the moment anyway, so it is not like I would tripling or even doubling my intake in one swift swoop. I am 33 years of age and have a good understanding of eating disorder complications (and also used to work in an eating disorder residential unit, ironically!) so I am also quite confident that I am not just being naive with the severity of a situation involving refeeding. I am simply trying to seek some reassurance that it should be fairly safe for me to embark on eating disorder recovery with less regular blood monitoring.Thank you in advance :)",_admin_moderator,"Mon,04/12/2021-1:51am",Welcome!,"Hi xellex1987, welcome to the forums.

I eat if am scheduled for work mainly for the energy that the Calories support me with until my later evening break at work.My weight has been climbing, like an Ivy climbs a fence, slow and steadily.I am having the same symptoms as when I had to take a strong rx after a way too heavy period. I'm supposed to be nearing menapause right now. A year of no periods will be evidence for a middle aged female like myself, that I am menapausal.As I have gotten older I have experienced missed or skipped periods for up to 4 months. Currently haven't had 1 in the last 3 months. I have suffered weight gain, weight fluctuations over short periods of time. Instead of increased appetite I have mostly lost my major appetite and only binge sometimes on certain foods....If I am nearing Menapause then I wonder what I need to keep me from continuously gaining weight. I work hard, and don't usually eat too much in meals. I walk an average of 4x per week. But am panicking over this steady weight gain. The last time I had this problem I was younger, like in my later 30's and early 40's. I had time and energy to swim tons of laps at the pool and then work out at the local gym in the evenings after a small dinner. I am not in the same boat any more. I  changed since lost both my parents. I began working 2 jobs. They were conducive to no gym workout but still lost weight. Now since stopped working both last 2 jobs, and my weight gain is really uncomfortable. It shifts from my abdominal area to my rib area. It feels like massive water retention. I am a powerless mess. I am using water pills and moderate exercise, and restrict food during the day. I eat 1 sensible meal at dinner, on days off from work. I am still gaining weight and don't know what to do. I have tons of jeans that I had purchased just last year when working at Macy's. Now they wont even zip up and this feels awful.It seems like the highlight of my day is when I feel pooped out and crawl into my futon to sleep at night. My dreams entertain me and I don't feel stressed or under pressure in my sleep.
I miss my old work, and I miss Not being able to exercise. I hate watching the evening news when they keep talking about Covid-19.  I feel like I caused it. I had total control over my body and was steadily losing weight before CV-19, and before losing my 2 jobs. I now feel anxious, and physically uncomfortable in my bloated body. I cant change my situation currently. Life feels like it's passing me by so quickly. It feels like I am the sand that is falling through the hour glass. I have experienced emotional traumas in my life earlier too. It seems harder for me to deal with my current situation just mentioned. The earlier traumas in my life are mostly involuntarily forgotten by dissipating clouded memories in my head. No nasty person's judging or comparing me to the Perfect Cinderella whom they meet while at church or on outings. No blackmailing me emotionally by doing the ""Good Guy Bad Guy"" thing w/ my head. I just gave up trusting either person in my past life of loneliness, rejection, and struggle. No one in my adult life taking me in under their wing and encouraging me to fly to the highest level of career or self actualization. Just promises used and wills made to feel like they were still better than my 1st FT job when back on my feet after a huge break in life w/ my former XBF. Mom would get upset  over something and snap at me and say in a manipulating way that if I am not doing something her way she would remove me from her will. Just out of the blue during an episode of her moodiness and needing to oppress her own daughter by ignoring or threatening blackmail on me for being myself.While residing with both my ex and then after returning back home again, I saw a pattern that I used to be my fail safe way of escaping during times of sharp, hurtful, and emotionally abusive times. I would bring myself to the Er and confess to feeling awful. Feeling like there was no tomorrow left for me. In order to be placed on a hold I would have to act upon my emotional  feelings of hurt. I would have to do things to myself to prove that I  was worthy of a ""51/50.""  Sometimes I even missed the hospital and old drama when I wasn't on a psych evaluation. It seems safer and nicer to be on a hold than feeling cold, and lonely, and that there was no where else to turn to. Loneliness is a very powerful emotion that would make me turn to last resorts in order to buff my fall from success and glory while young and naïve. Someday, if I have enough focus and energy, and not many relatives left around to act upset by my novella I may resort to writing a novella of my life and times of my joys, and darkest moments while growing up as a lonely and isolated ? human being....X-Girl vr Mini-Pausal Mary.....No, I will have to work on the actual subjects and the title of my future novella......",_admin_moderator,"Thu,04/08/2021-2:37pm",Hi 2Healthy4me ,"Hi 2Healthy4me!

86,junebug,04/06/2021,trying to be better,"hello. so its been a long time since i have been alright.
years.
and ive known that.
i ignore it and hope it ignores me, this thing that i cant even identify yet.
this problem that prohibits me from ever feeling comfortable with food.
im hoping to get a diagnosis, i just wanna know what is going on.
i want to know why i have such a terrible eating habit.
i want to know why i get sick every morning.
i dont want to do any more medical tests.
i dont want to feel sick every day.
i want to talk to someone and learn about why i react to food the way i do.
everyone around me is so worried and they want to help.
but they cant. they think its simple, of course.
they beg for me to fix myself, to take better care of myself.
but theyre not me. they dont feel the things i feel.
my dad called me crying because he was so worried.
my sister called me crying because she was so worried.
that made me feel so bad.
theyre giving me support, sure, but god, why does it have to be that way?
why does it feel like blame?
the hospital didnt even care that i get sick every day.
i went a few days ago.
I went. I took myself, and they just gave me fluids,
told me to see a GI, and sent me home a few hours later.
i was honest with them. they shouldnt have just brushed me off.
but they did. and it made me feel even worse.
i feel so weak.
every day i feel so weak and helpless.
im gonna try and fix that. not for others, but for myself.
i hate who i am. i hate who i am when no one is around.
i hate the way i treat myself.
i hope i will fix that.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,04/07/2021-1:57pm","Dear junebug, we are sorry to","Dear junebug, we are sorry to hear that you have been struggling.

90,Mcl1994,04/04/2021,Referred by GP - My Story - Can anyone relate? ,"Brief - I am 26 and Female.  I walk, run and exercise daily. Background - I've struggled with undiagnosed BED / Purging now for over 10 years. I grew up in an abusive household and due to unprocessed trauma I turned to eating as a safety / comfort. My weight fluctuated all through high school and I was 'the fat girl who wore baggy clothes' I was never comfortable eating in front of people so I would hide food throughout the day and sneak off to eat or I would get home and just lock myself in my room to eat.
I watched as families sat around their dinner tables eating normally curiously wondering how they aren't consumed by the food, it seemed more strange to me that people did have control over their eating than not.When I turned 18 I said ""enough is enough"" and I went on a mission to lose the weight. I reduced my food intake cutting out carbs, joined a gym and quickly watched weight fall off me although I was 'skinny' I was severely malnourished and I had become obsessed with reading the back of labels, sugars, grams everything. I worked in a health foods store at the time so that added even more pressure to me as I wanted to keep up with the image subconsciously. After  2 years I collapsed one day after work in a college class and was rushed to hospital. This wasn't healthy and my family found out I had been starving my self to try and get extra weight off of me.After the weight came off the habits of my binging were still there just replaced now with healthier foods. I still ate in large quantities and my mind was obsessed with food.  No one knew what was going on apart from a few family members and this went on for the next 6 years. Finally, I quit hiding and I called up my Doctor during the Covid-19 crisis and told her that I was scared for my health if I continued to ignore this. She told me that she would refer me to eating disorder specialists. I felt afraid to talk about this with someone because I had kept it such a secret for so long but I knew if I didn't get help this could carry on into my future marriage and children.2 weeks ago a letter came in the mail for an appointment with a psychiatrist I had been referred to this same Psychiatrist years ago and I do not like him or his practice, he was very unsympathetic and clinical pushing drugs instead of talking therapies etc. I want to make a request to see a female also but I don't know if they would allow it (I am thankful I've been referred at all) but I was confused as she said she was referring me to eating disorder specialists? Is this normal? I desperately want help",_admin_moderator,"Mon,04/05/2021-12:46am",Welcome!,"Hi Mcl1994, welcome to the forums. We just wanted to let you know we edited your post to remove numbers, as they could be triggering to other users.

99,silverstars,03/26/2021,Waiting For Assesment & Struggling...,"Hello,All.So in my recent general pysch inpatient stay the pyshciatrist referred me to a php program  three afternoons and evenings a week.I have been out of hospital about a month and have not had a proper meal since.Heavily restricting.I have refractory OCD which has really joyfully latched on to my eating disorder and I am constantly weighing myself,recording my BMI in my journal,and counting calories.My weight has dropped significantly since being in hospital and I have this strong feeling that they at the php program are going to refer me to a higher level of care.To be honest,I think realistically inpatient would be more ideal for me since in php i would be responsible for all my meals and snacks the rest of the week all on my own,and to tell the truth I really don't feel capable of doing that right now.My mood is low,my anxiety is high.I live up four flights of stairs with no elevator and I am weak and out of breath every time I have to climb them.Body image issues are terrible.The thing is,I am only on the waiting list for an assessment,not for acceptance into the program.I am so blessed to live in Canada without having to deal with insurance issues as so many of you so sadly have to deal with,but this also means much longer waiting lists.I am afraid I just cannot stop this without help.I do have my pyschiatrist who is also my therapist but really no other support.I struggle to eat even the least little bit of anything.I have this sick voice in my head telling me how important it is to be small and to not take up space.I had to buy new jeans as when I was doing better about 6 months ago I got rid of my""sick clothes.""Of course,I also have that all too familiar voice that tells me that I am ""Not sick enough.""
I know what I would tell somebody else in my position,but I just cannot seem to treat myself as I would treat a friend.I just do not feel worth it.So,as I await the call,well,I just-I just can't,you know?I am a revolving door patient and I feel too old for this.l need to find.somewhere within me some determination to fight this.A reason not to just give up already.Because I am just so tired.So very very tired...",_admin_moderator,"Sat,03/27/2021-10:41am",Resources,"Hi silverstars, We are sorry to hear that you are struggling right now.  We’re glad that you reached out to the forums.

102,OliviaMaxr,03/14/2021,I need help now. Please help me,"I first started to struggle with my weight in early 2019. I was a freshman to a new boarding school in fall 2018, and since I was not doing any sport, I gained some weight. The beginning of second semester, I began to try to loose weight, in a healthy way: I was not restricting too harshly, I just began to eat more veggies and to exercise more. And then at spring parents weekend, my mom came to see me. We were at lunch with about 6 of my other friends and their parents, and I had a plate that looked like a lot of food but was not very dense. My mom called me out asking why I was eating this much in front of everyone. I began to restrict and to try to loose weight faster. I lost my period that June, but I kept trying to loose weight. Thanksgiving that year, I began to binge. I ate until my stomach hurt and my back hurt. During Christmas, my mom took me to see doctor because my period had not come in 6 month, and I began to take pills. But after Christmas, I binged even more. I was stealing others’ food from the fridge in our dorm. Then COVID came in 2020, and I went home. I started try to loose weight, and, because my parents were at home also, I could not binge unless they went out. I binged far less at home, probably once every two or three weeks. Before at school, I binged four to five days out of a seven-day week. I once told my parents that I binged all those food, and my dad reacted with surprise and asked me “how could you even eat all these”. I felt ashamed. I lost weight by December 2020 and I wasn’t restricting at all. I ate deserts atet I wanted to, and I could stop afterwards without feeling shamed. I thought I was better. After Christmas, I returned to my boarding school January 2021. The first three weeks went fine. When February hit, I binged again. I am again stealing others’ leftover food in the fridge and taking food out of the trash can to eat, even though I am well aware that there’s COVID and that I can easily catch it through eating what others have bitten. My period still hasn’t come, after almost two years. I am too ashamed to talk to my parents and friends about my struggles, and I kept it from them. But I know that I need help. I don’t want to live like this forever. It has been two years, and I really want it to stop so that I can actually enjoy my food.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,03/15/2021-1:31am",OliviaMaxr,"Hi OliviaMaxr, welcome to the forums.

I know I probably sound stupid but seeing how there are other people a lot sicker than me I start to wonder if I even deserve this. Maybe I need to get sicker before I can deserve to recover or something. I just wanna be ok but my ED was my distraction from all the traumatic things that happened to me, even what happened to me just 6 months ago.. I never had to think about it when I had my ED but in recovery I do and I’m scared to face it.

This time I was watching the south park pandemic special in the bathroom.
It comes up every day.
Restriction. Then mom offers me food while she dumps her narcissism all over me.
I couldn’t climb at the gym. I was too tired from restriction the days before.
But I still hate my body.
I weighed myself at YYY – X pounds too heavy
Looked at my pictures from last year when I was YYY – a year ago today when the pandemic started.
Staring at the same v7s in the gym that I could climb a year ago but am too heavy nowShame Shame Shame These are the thoughts
‘couldn’t I have done something better with my life during COVID?’
‘I should be going to meetings, connecting with people virtually, I know the way out, I asked god this morning to take my compulsion’
‘my life this year is the worst I’ve ever been’
‘sometimes I think I might as well relapse on drugs because nobody’s watching and I have nothing to live for’
‘Princess Dianna using bulimia as a cry for help in the Royal Family – but I don’t have any issues like her’
‘Why can’t I just eat like a normal person’
'I was supposed to be an athlete this year after I lost my job'
‘I don’t deserve my wonderful boyfriend’
‘I hope my house ignites on fire right now and I die’
‘I don’t want to do anything anymore’
‘I just want the recess to come up, then I will be a good girl’I know it doesn’t work to get rid of the calories
It fuels the self-hate fire
Its punishment I deserve
It’s a moment of me regaining control after losing it
I hate myself
But I brush my teeth, wash my face and text my boyfriend goodnightI need help

105,Brianna7860,03/10/2021,Lost my closest sibling and don't know if I need to seek help due to health problems.,"Seeking help.
Since the beginning of December 2020. Its been a seriously rough road for me.
I lost my younger brother in December (completely shocking). He was my best friend my person. I struggle with chronic depression and tend to have a hard time functioning along with eating included when I'm severely depressed. It sent me down a dark hole that was a struggle to come somewhat out of. Still trying to pick my self up as there is qlot of questions to be awnsered. I got back to work thinking it was the best thing for me along with raising two kids. I couldn't eat for almost two weeks. Then went on to eating daily. Then I started to work everyday minimum of 12 hours a day for 6 days a week (sleep all day on sundays..)
I have gotten to the point I feel so hungry at points but I can only eat a few bites of something. And I get sick with in a hour. Now I eat something and within 20 mins I have this horrible stomach pain and have to go to the bathroom and feel extremely sick. But I have to sit there for about a half hour and I have just diarrhea. Everyday a customer mentions my significant weight loss. My vision gets blurry, can't sleep, Hardly drink anything, but gotta keep moving. Not intentionally doing this. I try to eat and drink but my body won't take it. I get really weak. I havnt weighed myself due to he fear of how much I loss. I dont know what to do or how serious its become but I wanted options. Dont know my weight but I can say in a couple weeks I've dropped pant sizes.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,03/11/2021-2:17pm",Hi Brianna7860,"Hi Brianna7860!

118,asdfghout201,03/01/2021,Rambling,"Hi everyone,
I've never posted on here before but figured maybe it'd help me to get out my thoughts. I don't even care if no one reads this or replies, I just need to rant. I've been struggling with binge eating disorder for about 3 years now. It is one of the hardest things I've ever gone through. Food and self image are almost always on my mind. I honestly don't even know what my body or even my face looks like, I view myself differently everyday and it's really draining. I know I shouldn't have, but I bought a scale the other day because it was on sale and in a random endcap of target. I hadn't weighed myself in a long time, or at least been able to see my weight (with a dietician she didn't show me my weight). I have a number in my mind that I've been fearing for years and if I ever get to that weight I genuinely don't know what I'll do. I'm very close to that weight and that scares me so much. I can't stand looking at myself naked in the mirror for too long, it will trigger me and I just absolutely hate the way I look. I'm most insecure about my stomach, I absolutely hate it. I literally feel pregnant and i just can't even explain how much I hate my stomach it makes me so insecure, more than any other part of my body. Well anyways, the good part, that I'm proud of myself for, is coming up. I weighed myself this morning, kind of triggered myself, because my weight had gone up in just a short time but I don't think that's possible? I hope it isn't at least. I haven't binged super hard in the last 3 days either, so I especially don't see how that's possible. I hope I'm not deluding myself. Anyways, I immediately felt extremely triggered like I said, and just sat on my bed for a while just thinking negative thoughts. I decided to look online for stories of people who've recovered from BED and just reading their stories and advice helped me. I was almost going to download a calorie counting app, but I decided, okay, I need to journal, I think that will help. I haven't done it yet, but someone said they've had so many epiphanies about food and why they binge while journaling and I think I need to try that. It's just hard with so much conflicting info out there about BED: it's an emotional response vs its just a bad habit, you shouldn't restrict foods vs you should keep trigger foods out of your house, you should track your foods vs you shouldn't. It's hard to decide which path to follow. I think, for me, not dealing with the issue head on would help, but not forever. I want to recover because I am tired of feeling uncomfortable with my weight and body. I try to calm myself and think about how when I recover, my body will naturally fluctuate to the weight I'm supposed to be at, and i know for sure this is not where I am supposed to be at, but I still can't help but be worried that I will gain even more weight. I just want to feel comfortable in my body. Although I am aware that losing weight doesn't necessarily change my self image, I still delude myself into thinking maybe it would. I've been working on trying to recover from more of an emotional standpoint, working on inner child, working thru my feelings, journaling, etc. I do think I've made some progress, for a long time (months and months) I just let my BED fully run the show everyday. I will say I'm proud of myself for at least trying to take the reigns. It's better than nothing, and that's something to be proud of. Any effort is better than none. Although sometimes I really do feel controlled physically and mentally by my ED I know at the end of the day i don't HAVE to listen to my urges. There's alot of things I'm urged to do everyday and I don't do them, so why shouldn't I apply the same logic to this? That makes me feel empowered, maybe not to some people, but for me it does. Like I am not a prisoner to this, even though it feels like it. I CAN get better, even if that means 1 less binge a week, or one less food eaten during a binge, that would still be so good for me. i don't have the confidence to say I'm confident I'll recover from this, but I do think i can at least make the binges less frequent. it is super super super hard when i want to binge to stop myself from doing it. it literally feels like nothing else I've ever experienced. It's just this like craving so bad and the angel and devil on my shoulder fighting it. it really does feel like withdrawls, like if someone quit smoking. I think I read somewhere that food addiction is as addicting as heroin. That is soo scary and I almost wish i didn't read that, because in what universe do I think I could recover from a heroin addiction???? None. ANother thing that's really hard for me is that I do have friends with ED but almost all have anorexia. I don't personally understand anorexia, just like they don't fully understand binge eating disorder. I wish more people took BED seriously like they did anorexia and bulimia. It feels embarrasing to say i have BED to people who have the exact opposite problem. We support each other when we can but I do almost feel a sense of jealously. I know that's horrible and I shouldn't think that, but it's the part of my brain that wants to feel more validated and supported, and wishes i could be in control more. I hope that doesn't invalidate anyone, i know anorexia and bulimia are just as serious and horrible. It's just one of those twisted ED thoughts in my brain if that makes sense. We all have thoughts we know we shouldn't have sometimes. I'm just trying to take it day by day at this point. I do think I have made some progress so far and I am proud of myself for that. I hope if I write again that I will have some good updates!",_admin_moderator,"Mon,03/01/2021-7:37pm",Welcome!,"Hi asdfghout201 - welcome to the forums! We’re glad you’re here.

Nothing seems to be helping me. I am really discouraged. I feel like I should just cancel my appointments.

121,thelittlemermaid,02/28/2021,Wondering,"Hey everyone..this is my first time on here and I was hesitant to come on but I hope I did the right choice. First of all, I haven't been diagnosed with any eating disorder, but I suspect I may have anorexia. However, sometimes I doubt if I'm really ill or sick enough to even suggest getting help. I eat normally, or to a degree (however, I don't eat as much as many people think I should, in my mind, I think I eat normally but I wouldn't know for sure). I am obsessed with how I look and hate the way I do even though everyone tells me I look fine; I just want to be beautiful and in my mind the only way to be beautiful is to be super super skinny. I don't eat dinner or lunch and fast a lot. I also don't eat certain food groups and two days ago when my parents forced me to eat dinner, I felt such anxiety and helplessness afterwards. I get lightheaded and it goes black when I stand up every time and my hair is falling out, however for the past two days it hasn't been that bad, not like when it would be falling everywhere. I feel so guilty after eating, but no one knows and I conceal it very well. I don't look emaciated and I know I'm not overweight and my BMI is lower but not clinically underweight either. I look healthy and athletic and that leads me to conclude that I am fine and in need of no help. Anyway, to keep it short, I don't know what I should do. I don't want to embarrass myself by asking for help for something that's not even wrong!",_admin_moderator,"Sun,02/28/2021-11:21pm",thelittlemermaid,"Hi thelittlemermaid. Welcome to the forums.

123,khappy,02/27/2021,"I need resources and help, asap.","I am going to try to shorten ""my story"" down as much as possible, but in order for me to get help, I have to start from the beginning. My situation is so unique... I am terrified I will never find help. Because so far, i havn't.
I was abused and neglected as a child, my parents withheld food as punishment, but would also force feed me my least favorite foods as punishment. Because of that, I have always been an EXTREMELY picky eater. Im super sensitive to taste and texture. I dont like most healthy foods.
Around the age of 14, my parents got divorced, and when that happened my life went from a world of no freedom and abuse, to a world with no parents at all. After they divorced, it was like they didn't have to be parents anymore. And suddenly I had no rules or anything. Around that time, I started to experience severe nausea almost constantly. I would get nauseous if I ate, but also if I didn't eat. It was horrible, but manageable.
At the age of 15 I got pregnant and of course the nausea increased immensely, I had severe Hyperemesis gravidarum my entire pregnancy, threw up constantly.
After my son was born, the sickness with food never went away. I struggled to eat, and would go days without eating despite being a breastfeeding mother.
After 2 months of this, I finally found something that helped, medical Marijuana. I have always been very against Marijuana, but it really did help, it was life changing, I could eat again! I never would take enough to get high, just enough to eat.
Fast forward 2 years, I am 18 now(19 in April lol)and I have now grown extremely dependent on Marijuana to eat. everytime I try to quit smoking, I end up being hospitalized from starving. The longest I went without smoking, I couldn't eat the entire time without throwing up.But I CANNOT keep smoking. I hate it, it makes me feel awful, despite how it helps me eat. I'm on day 2 of quitting now and I just cannot seem to make myself eat, im so sick and weak. The one thing I did eat, it instantly came back up despite trying SO hard to not throw it up.
I don't know what to do. I do not have enough money to see any of the ED specialists around me, and nobody around here accepts my insurance. There are VERY few ED specialists around here, so i like have no options it feels like.
I need to find someone who is able to help me fight off the mental fear I have of food, due to my parents. And I need someone who can maybe help me develop a diet plan based around the foods I like. I am not mentally ready to start combating the extreme picky eating yet, first I need to just focus on telling my brain and stomach to let me eat and keep it down.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,02/28/2021-11:22pm",khappy,"Hi khappy, welcome to the forums.

Haven't been here for quite some time but now I'm faced with a new eating disorder symptom, which really troubles me. So coming from a restrictive past, one of my greatest fears besides weight gain was/is developing binge eating disorder. I'm not as restrictive as in the past and allowing a number of foods that I forbade myself when I was anorexic but now I started stuffing my face with the most absurd and random things and don't swallow them. This really scares me. In these moments it seems I'm losing all control of my mind, body,.... I can't stop. Is this the first step into binge eating disorder? How do I stop this stupid behaviour? I have truly never before in my life been so ashamed of something. It makes me feel utterly disgusting, weak, scared... why can't I control myself anymore? Has anyone else experienced this?

I mainly binge eat in the evening so much that I make myself feel sick, I always say this will be the last time, I’ll get back on my diet tomorrow but it never is! I managed 4 weeks of no binge eating at the beginning of this year and lost weight and felt so much better in myself but I have slipped back to binge eating every day the last couple of weeks and I don’t know why. There are some food that are the worst and I managed to cut them out at the beginning of the year and that really helped but I just can’t seem to get a grip on it anymore.

Either that or they just refuse to acknowledge it. I was fool enough to believe that I’d beaten it a few years ago bc I actually wanted to eat and gain weight. Boy was I naive. Even though I’m no longer obsessed with being as thin as possible i still have crippling body image issues. I still feel worthless after every meal. I still starve myself when I’m stressed, anxious, or depressed. I have numerous digestive issues, some of which could be hereditary but I’ve convinced myself that I caused them. I finally went to see a doctor today about them. I told myself that this was it and I’d finally tell someone what was really going on. Then she, like every doctor before, complimented me on how thin i was and told me i was lucky to be thin w/o having to exercise. I smiled and said “thank you” as you do... but my heart broke.

I feel happy knowing that I have a job in spite of the covid crisis taking my last 2 meaningful jobs from me. I work in my community and we have many repeat customers, which is great as long as they behave.A few come in intoxicated, or just in a totally mindless state. I feel good seeing them gather their favorite items and rush up for me to ring them up.This entire week my left side has been aching. I use OTC Ibuprofen but I ache all day until I crashed at night. I eat snacks at night as a reward for my making it through an 8 hr shift, 4 days in a row.Some nights I just feel down about my life feeling in Limbo. No longer limber, cant even clip my own right side toenails. Want a newer used car but cant decide on 1. Feeling stressed out over what i shall do about a living situation from age 55 on ? I miss my crazy parents too....They were a crazy couple, like watching a sit com whenever I was around them. They were like the perfect couple, like Lucy and her Cuban, musician husband. Always happy and supporting of 1 another.My life and former love life was supposed to end like theirs, in a long, happy, trusting marriage to 1 loyal partner and yet I can't seem to find any single men who are like me   My last love fizzled out after we dated for 8 yrs +, and we went our separate ways...I Have agoraphobia so i cant just pull myself up by My Bootstraps and Keep on Going like The Eveready Bunny. I CAN'T. I'm SCARED of My Future. It's not like medications will ail me of this reality of Total Change.It seems easier to go to sleep and Never awaken to another day of Wondering, or Anxiety, or Hard Work and not enough pay , during the year that I had finally earned almost 50K. No, everything seems so frozen and unreal and I cant accomplish anything like i had in the past that seemed to have actually meant something to Me.No More Days of Looking Forward to Hope and Happiness, just free floating anxiety and red tape in planning out my future for a few tiny people in my life...It's like eating all grapes for now!!!My side hurts, all round my left ribs, and gotta get ready for my last night shift at the pharm store...Bye all.....",_admin_moderator,"Thu,02/11/2021-2:31pm",Support Options,"Hi 2Healthy4me!

139,alligatorob,02/06/2021,Looking for advice,"This is my first post here, hope I am in the right place.I am a 68 year old man who has been a binge eater all my life, my mother told me more or less since birth, certainly all of it I can remember.  I have been on lots of diets and gained and lost a lot of weight over the years.  My all time high was X pounds a number of years ago. Last year in the spring when I was at X pounds I started a very low calorie diet and exercise. In about a year I got down to X pounds and I have been maintaining the loss for the last 6 months. So success on the weight side of things. I am down a little over X pounds from my peak. I am quite lucky on the heath side, no real health problems... so far.However I do not believe I have cured my binge eating disorder, only held it in place with a combination of will power and finding very low calorie things to binge on.  Problem is as I struggle to maintain it feels harder and harder to hold the binges back.  I have urges every day, some days much of the time.  One thing I have been doing is eating a lot of low calorie foods most days... It feels like I am still bingeing, just doing it with things that don't cause weight gain. Not nearly so satisfying as bingeing on higher calorie foods, but it helps. I have to say I am not so happy with what the high mass does to my digestive system, but right now I prefer that to obesity...Problem is I still have the urge to eat high calorie things, often a strong urge, and it seems to be be getting worse.  When I was losing weight there was a real reinforcement value to seeing progress, but that is gone now, maintaining just doesn't feel as rewarding as losing.  This is the first time in my life I have had any success maintaining weight loss, I usually start regaining weight within days of ending a diet.  I sure do not want to regain the weight, and any advice or suggestions are welcome.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,02/07/2021-11:35pm",alligatorob,"Hi alligatorrob, welcome to the forums.

142,TripleA,02/07/2021,Not getting enough calories,ok so about my history in a nutshell from birth to age 7. I was underweight then had tonsils and adnoids removed and started to gain weight tried everything from eating right to exercising and at age 10 or 11 started to restrict and purge started therapy and still in therapy. I think my family and friends are naieve about the fact that i have an eating disorder because i'm currently overweight and they've never seen the warning signs and just thought o she ate something that didn't agree or typical teenage diet etc. Fast forward to current I'm an adult and only a handful of people know that I'm struggling with my eating such as my therapist and a few friends but the hardest part for me is getting enough calories per day and when I do then my mind automatically goes to how much exercise i need to do in order to burn off those calories. I don't fit the typical eating disorder criteria therefor i'm unable to recieve help from a treatment center. Just wondering how can I change my mindset so that food doesn't seem like a danger and not let my eating disorder kill me.,_admin_moderator,"Sun,02/07/2021-11:36pm",TripleA,"Hi TripleA, welcome to the forums.

145,JustMe23,02/03/2021,What do I do now .. ,"This is the first time I have ever posted to a forum or sought to discuss my eating problems with anyone. I'm not even certain I have an 'eating disorder' but I know my behaviour is unhealthy.. I just don't know how to stop.
I have had issues with food for about 15 years now - since I was a teenager, after being bullied at school and called fat - although I have never been over-weight medically speaking. Also the attitude within my family was always 'fat is bad'.
It started with controlling my food intake due to body image and self confidence issues. I exercise obsessively. Weight loss leads to compliments so I continue to eat less and exercise more. I eventually get so hungry I binge - then feel guilty and purge.
This is a cycle that just seem to go on and on.
As I have got older I have got very good at hiding my behaviour - my husband knows I have some body image issues but he has no idea how bad. My parents, friends etc know nothing.
I have always managed to stop just short of passing out, although being dizzy is an everyday feeling for me so I am just sort of used to it. My mum once asked me if I was anorexic after I lost a lot of weight in a month but she didn't question me any further after I said no.
My weight goes up and down a lot depending on my mental health - when I am not doing well I stop eating, so I lose weight and I receive compliments from friends and mums on the playground. This acts as a boost for my mental health so if I start to feel better, my eating normalises for a while. Then some weight goes back on and the compliments stop - which makes me stop eating again.
I get pains a lot, especially around my ribs, I think this may be down to purging.
If I do have an eating disorder, I have no idea what 'type' - I have never read about one that fits the description of how I am.
I'm honestly scared of getting help as I feel like recovery will end up with me gaining weight which is my worst nightmare. I just have no idea what to do now.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,02/04/2021-12:58pm","Dear JustMe23, welcome to the","Dear JustMe23, welcome to the NEDA Forums!

153,SLMaxwell,01/28/2021,I think I might be on the sort of path to an ED starting and don't know what to do,"[TW: Bad parents, mentions of eight and being insulted based on that, slight emetophobia warning]Hi...
I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to put this, but I don't know where to go and I'm scared.
I'm seventeen and most my life I've been underweight - I only really started being ""normal weight"" around the start of high school, and it was never anything I did, I was just born Small in all regards (e.x, I was always the shortest in elementary, and I'm still the shortest person I know).Anyways... My mom's been constantly being like ""you're going to get fat"", ""all you eat is junk"", ""do you even care about your body"", ""why don't you ever eat anything GOOD FOR YOU"", but... I'm autistic. She's been doing this a lot lately and I recently had final exams. I don't have much energy and she hasn't given me time to ""recharge"" so I just grab whatever I can eat without having to do much or any preparation because then I can eat but still have energy for more important things like school. (She also will not do this for me as she says I can't just ""have her do everything for [me] at seventeen"")But of course, she doesn't GET that. ...The other day I didn't eat dinner because just the idea of eating made me feel sick - I don't know why, there wasn't really a reason - and then when I was going to bed she lashed out at me for making her ""waste her time"" making dinner when I had told her I didn't eat because I felt sick to my stomach.
She blamed it on me eating a snack that afternoon - hours before she had even made dinner - and then went on a rant about ""how all [I] ever eat is a certain type of food! all [I] eat is junk you're going to gain weight like that do you want gain weight? i shouldn't let you eat that crap it's all junk""Next day I was too afraid of her lashing out to eat anything more than a piece of X. It didn't MATTER that I was in pain from how hungry it was. If I didn't eat, then she couldn't yell at me for eating the ""wrong"" or ""bad"" foods! My pain and hunger didn't matter. Nothing mattered.
Even when I got the One Piece Of X I kept asking her ""it's okay if I eat this? It's not bad if I eat this? I won't get in trouble, right?"" until she got mad at me for asking so many times.Jump to today. I didn't finish my dinner because it was too much. Then she got offended because ""what? you don't like my cooking?""
A few hours later I got some dessert because I didn't feel like garbage anymore and I was hungry. Then she said ""Oh, so you're too full to eat your meal but not enough to not eat dessert? You know when I was a kid if we didn't eat dinner we didn't GET desert.""...I used behaviors a few minutes later. After she said that the idea of eating has once again been making me nauseous. ....Even while writing this, I feel like purging in general. That way she can't talk about how I'm ""ruining my body"".
I'm considering restricting tomorrow, too.....I know it's bad and I know it's not healthy. But I don't know what to do...
I'm scared this will turn into an eating disorder. I don't know what to do and I'm scared... I can't see another option.
I feel like I'm being a bad person for, what? Eating??
Like, it's fine if SHE eats a lot in one night, but I eat One plate and suddenly I'm ""ruining my body"" and stuff. ...It feels like a double-standard. The rules don't apply to her, but they apply to me, I guess.I think I need help. ...Please, does someone, anyone have advice? I know I keep saying it but I don't know what to do... I'm scared about this.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,01/29/2021-3:19pm","Dear SLMaxwell, we would like","Dear SLMaxwell, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove mentions of food and details about disordered eating behaviors, since they can be triggering to other users.

The thing that is the hardest for me is my body changing. I know I looked unhealthily skinny before.  Now I just feel bloated all the time and I'm starting to hate my body like I did before my eating disorder. I know I'm still not even close to the weight I was before, but I feel like I am.

155,bluekitty,01/27/2021,"Feeling alone, would like to hear some feedback. ","Hi everyone. This is my first time doing this kind of thing, so I am quite sure what I should do, but I wanted to try and open up about this. I do not want to trigger anyone or exaggerate my situation, I just want to be honest as possible.I am 18 years old and a freshman girl in college. Late July of 2020 I weighed X, and looked my heaviest physically. I wanted to lose weight so I intentionally restricted for about 2 weeks. I decided to restrict, (I do not know what correct term to use, my apologies!) because its the easiest method for me. I have lost weight twice in the past, (unintentionally, I went through a break up and just loss the appetite to eat, my first time experiencing loss of appetite). So because of those past experiences I decided to restrict. So after those 2 weeks, I wanted to keep losing weight but knew this was not a sustainable method, so I decided to use another method. Fast forward to now, I have ended up in the cycle of restriction, calorie counting, and excessive exercising, and I do not think I can ever eat over the amount of calories my body needs to function. I know that I am in it, and its like half of me knows I need help, but at the same time, I dont know if I can really do it, or if I can allow myself too. I  never had a problem like this before and my mom has shown concern once or twice but I’ve always brushed it off so she thinks I just have a new healthy lifestyle now. This is just the gist of the past couple months. Longstory short, I really don’t know what to do, and I feel really alone. I am extremely depressed now and my only motivation is to keep losing weight, but at the same time I know I will regret it later. I don’t want to end up in a hospital. I would really appreciate some advice or feedback on what I should do. I want to do better for myself but at the same time, I really just want to ignore it and wait for something to happen that forces me to stop. I just cant imagine myself reaching out.

157,Victoria1992,01/25/2021,My story ,"So I have never spoken really about my eating disorder. I am nearly 27 and I have struggled on and off since I was about 15 with eating and food, it has just intensified in my mid 20s. Food for me is form of control, self harm and release. The only way I can describe an eating disorder is its like having another person in your head telling you your not good enough, no thin enough, to eat loads, to not eat anything, to purge, to get it out of your body in any way you can. There is a constant voice in your head making you doubt everything you do and always making you feel bad about yourself. There is no size or weight that is small enough.
I have gone through phases of being sick and then looking like I'm getting better. However only people who have an eating disorder wil know, you never get better, that voice is always there. I put on a bit of weight to please everyone around me, to make them leave me alone. Then slowing the feeling sinks in again, the voices, making you feel like you’re not enough. Will the voices ever go?
I feel like I'm always going to be this way and hiding it from people is getting harder and harder, if I don't want to eat I feel like I shouldnt have to. I have a major problem/addiction with laxatives. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't get comfy, I never knew when I was gong to need to go. I have tried weened myself off these and went cold turkey, but I found from alll the abuse I couldn't go at all. So I found myself in the vicious cycle again.
I feel like I have a really addictive personality and my biggest addiction is being thin and then food, I love food but I have so many conflicting views of it. I don't think people really realise how hard it is to have you addiction be one of the things you need to live.
I feel like no one understand me so I don't ever talk about anything and try and keep it to myself. Does anyone feel this way?

My realistic and obtainable goal is management of my disorder, to be comfortable physically and mentally with a life long food addiction affliction that plagues me. ""Been there, done that"", if you get my meaning. Good therapist right now. Will be speaking with her on the phone at 5pm today. Stuck in my home because of Covid which compounds the problem. Other health issues to deal with but not life threatening but life interfering. As long as it's not nasty out I walk on soft ground. Particularly enjoy across the street from my house the cemetery. Put some of my late husbands ashes at the base of the big beautiful tree at the far end, in-and-out-great variety of moving my legs walk. So I pretend he's there and talk to him. He was great, unique, everyone has their favorite story about him, many fun and happy. Being with him was a spontaneous adventure. Have another loving partner now, so don't feel sorry for me. One time when I was hospitalized my late hubby drove up with the kids to see me he said to them ""your mother's a little loony-tunes with the food right now"". The powerful gut urge to reach for food hit within 45 minutes after finishing my breakfast. Don't know if I can resist. Working on acquiring a powerful mental force to combat this. Know all the why's etc. Ineffectual when having to eat at least 3 times a day when that very thing alters the goals I work so hard to achieve. Just to get a break...a break.

168,sophief1123,01/05/2021,Is it actually a problem?,"I’ve been struggling with an eating disorder ever since my junior year of high school. I had anorexia and got down to a dangerously low weight, but was able to recover on my own and never went into treatment or therapy. My senior year of high school, I was able to maintain a healthy weight and enjoy life. However, when I went away to college I started to get disordered thoughts again and have been battling them ever since. Throughout my 4 years of college I have been dealing with disordered eating and over exercising, but I maintained the same weight. Now I’m graduated from college and I moved into an apartment with my boyfriend. I’m a very low weight (but not as low as I was in high school) and I’m noticing a lot of negative disordered thoughts. I was able to stop exercising as much, mainly because I don’t have the time since I work now, but I also eat very low calories. I know I don’t want to lose weight, but there is a fear of gaining weight that is making me control my eating. My boyfriend is nervous for me and is trying to micromanage my eating, but that just causes fights because I don’t like someone controlling what I eat or asking me every night what I ate all day. I know I need to gain weight, and I know I can fix it myself since I was able to fight anorexia in high school by myself. But I don’t know if I should seek help/treatment. There’s a part of me that wants to gain weight and eat more, but there’s also a part of me that doesn’t want to change and is afraid to gain weight. I don’t consider myself to be bad enough to get treatment but I don’t want to have these negative thoughts for my whole life.

While it isn’t anything monumental, it feels extremely invigorating to know that I’m actively trying to get better. I recently had a talk with my parents about the severity of my ED and they took it very seriously. They already had suspicions something was wrong, but after having the talk with them, they decided to contact more doctors to get a formal diagnosis. This felt like a huge step forward as in my past doctors appointments, it felt as if my condition wasn’t being taken seriously, but now I’m actually going to receive treatment. However, theres just one thing thats been a bit of a problem, and its the fact that my parents (divorced) have different ideas of what will help me get better. My mom thinks only the doctors will be of any help, but my dad wants to introduce me to appetite stimulants in order to increase my caloric intake. TBH I’m a bit lost as to which one to follow as I know if I continue on my current “diet” my health will only get worse as I wait for the doctors to introduce treatment (can take a few months). But with my dad’s solution, I know it could get out of hand quickly if I become too reliant on the stimulants. I’m not really sure which is best, but for now I’m just trying my best to take small steps to recovery.

170,rachelblauu,01/18/2021,Metabolism Q.A.,"I was diagnosed with anorexia at the age of 17. I was able to weight restore, and then quickly lost more weight once I entered college.
I am 22 now. After meeting with a nutritionist, she told me my inability to remain weight restored for a long period of time has greatly impacted my BMR. Essentially, she told me my body has been has been in starvation mood for too long, and has “outsmarted me” she said. In my mind, it seems my only options are to gain weight as guided by her, or gain weight as a result of my low BMR and be unable to control it in the future.
Feeling like my weight is out of my control has drastically increased my anxiety and depression. I cannot fathom it being out of my control. In addition, the fear of no matter what I do I will gain weight has also increased discorded behaviors (as I feel like this is my only option).
I feel completely paralyzed and had no previous knowledge of metabolism, BMR, etc. It is also especially difficult because I don't feel I am/ look ""sick enough"" to have to gain weight. In other words, I am not experiencing any of the negative physical side effects I once did when I was underweight before.

176,jndyat,01/16/2021,Recovering alone without getting any professional help,"It has been 2 years since I first started to think that this has to stop. Now I haven’t had any medical or professional help, my parents does know about what I’m going through (one day when I was at the lowest of my anorexia, I sent an article of anorexia and its symptoms to my sister for her to send to my parents- because I was a coward to send it to them directly). My parents did bring me to a doctor, but it was our family doctor, an old man who I really do like. But since I didn’t say anything to that doctor, he just dismissed it as me being in a diet as a teenager. So when I decided to stop restricting and start eating, I think my parents might’ve thought that ‘hey she’s better already’.
In the 2 years or my supposedly lonely ‘recovery’, my anorexia has evolved into going back and forward from binge eating and bulimia. My physical health might be getting better, I no longer have heart palpitations and my menstruation cycle is back to normal. But I’m pretty sure my mental health is not getting better. I still have the same mindset as I do 5 years ago. I’m still afraid of gaining weight, I still feel like if I’m not at this ‘certain’ weight then there’s no point in anything.
I know I should’ve asked for professional help, or a nutritionist to help plan the right meal plan for the recovery 2 years ago. But when my parents stop looking like they were worried, I can’t get myself to disappoint them again. And I guess with 2 years of procrastination, I just can’t find the right timing.Sorry for the long writing and grammar mistake, this is my first time writing here, and english is not my first language.",_admin_moderator,"Sat,01/16/2021-9:23am","Hi Jndyat,","Hi Jndyat, welcome to the forums; we are sorry to hear you are going through such a rough time.

184,2Healthy4me,12/31/2020,"First Time Biting Into Crisp, Chewy,Fresh Fruit since i 1st Had Braces age 9.","I bit into a fruit the other day, and was surprised that I could.I had braces at age 9 or 10. Since then had never bitten into one, only sliced pieces. When i bit into it,  the other day,  I was pleased to see that I could do so. During the week, I experienced some childhood memories, feelings of being extra tired, and anxious too. Around that age, I had experienced some childhood abuse....This was a year of personal improvement on my outsides but this is when my childhood ego, of an innocent girl, was also shattered.I had moved from my favorite city where raised since birth. Then suddenly at age 9 had moved w/ my family to a New City.This is the year i went from being, ""A Third Grade nothing"" to a young girl in transition.My body went from being seriously overweight to becoming very lean. I began training for many different sports all since just having moved where I did nothing as my younger bro had taken precedent since his birth. So training to become an athlete because the resources were provided for me to do so, and many New Friends parents had the time to chauffeur my friends and i to these various sports classes. They even had a fancy ice rink at the mall, and stores that catered to young athletes, and dancers. I would try on these leotards for my gymnastic, tumbling, and skating classes.Then I began working out harder and harder. My body became like a lean child athlete's body.I fit into the outfits that had failed to fit me just months previous to my new level of work outs.I loved the feeling of associating Hard Work, with control over a previously chubby child's body. I could not eat certain foods as had just been educated on the foods I could Not eat vr the foods OK to eat, or how to prepare my foods so I could eat them.That's where the fruit came into play. I could Not bite into them anymore after age 10. I developed good knifing skills from having to prepare fruits before i could eat them. Thus, the other day I tried biting into one to see what it felt like. I was surprised to experience the ability to do so w/o any special way to do so.That's when I began having strange dreams, childhood types, and became more quiet as w/ braces.So waking up this morning from very loud fireworks made me feel like a startled child at home all by herself on New Years Eve. I panicked, i felt so embarrassed that I woke up screaming and feeling like a burglar was breaking in on me, and in the room I was sleeping in...So this early morning I awakened to a panik attack involving me yelling out of fear of a noise triggered by noisy fireworks. I do avoid noisy things like those whenever possible so this panik attack upon awakening from the outside noise was just so strange that it was triggered by my anxiety, noise, and worst nightmare forming a trinity style panik attack.Happy New Year everyone 12AM=2021.....",_admin_moderator,"Thu,12/31/2020-5:32pm",Editing Note,"Hi, we edited part of your post as specific details can be triggering for other members of the forum.

188,Katarina123,01/02/2021,The constant feeling of sickness,"Hello everyone! I have a question. I have now been recovering from anorexia for over two months (I have increased my calorie intake drastically, I eat as much as I can) and I am suffering every single day because of how sick I am after a meal. I don’t listen to my body when it’s full and I force myself to eat the meal because my parent assure me it’s the right amount. But I can’t do this any more. I am constantly sick and this doesn’t feel natural or okay. I also get really hot when eating and my nose turns red and I get a horrible headache, but I don’t know if that’s still due to the stress that my guilty feelings bring me.
I'm afraid constantly feeling sick and nauseous is going to make me boulimic, because I keep having thoughts about how amazing it would be if I wouldn't have to eat or if I could just vomit out this food and feel good again. I hate this feeling of being too full because it reminds me of when I used to binge eat last year and the memories are traumatic for me. I used to constantly feel this unnaturaly full and I don't know if this is something I should be doing. Should I force myself to keep eating even after I'm full now that I'm recovering?
I’m just really concerned about whether or not I should force myself into eating so much that I feel THIS bad and if this is normal. I would be above grateful for an answer from someone who has dealt with a similar issue in the past.

195,crabqueen,12/27/2020,sought out help for the first time... overwhelmed,"I recently sought out help for my ED for the first time. I am overwhelmed with the thoughts that are constantly in my head. I've known I've had anorexia for years but never been diagnosed officially, until last week. It is not surprising but now that I know I have it for sure, I don't know where to go from here. I'm 21 and graduating college in May. I genuinely do not have the mental capacity to do the outpatient online therapy group that my therapist wants me to be a part of. I also have a new therapist, and I guess I'm just overwhelmed with the thought of actually working on getting better with a real live human... I feel like I lie to myself a LOT about my relationship with food. I've lost x pounds, which is kind of a lot for me. I like how I look but I miss having curves. But the thought of food always makes me nauseas, unless it's ""kid"" foods. I want to eat healthy and have a good body via a good diet and exercise, and cook more sophisticated foods. I am a smart and loved person, I have a great support system (family and friends) and I am lucky to be this aware of how my ED is affecting me. The problem is ACTUALLY doing something to help myself, rather than just sit here STILL STARVING MYSELF despite my rational efforts to eat. I know this illness is not rational, and that's probably the most frustrating part. My thoughts are telling me one thing, and my entire being believes the opposite of these thoughts...somehow the thoughts that I'll never be good enough, that the texture of foods will make me sick, that the feeling of it going down my throat is worse than death itself... These thoughts always seem to win. Then I smoke weed and become even more depressed, because it seems that's the only way I'm able to eat, but it interacts with dissociative side way too much, and I end up extremely suicidal.I hope this is not too much for this forum, and I thank anyone who reads this. Even support or knowledge that someone read this would be enough comfort for me.. I feel so alone and lost, and I have no idea how to talk to anyone about the position I'm in. I need to quit smoking for my mental health, but I can't eat enough calories without smoking... I just wish I could enjoy food like everyone in my life, and not reject it. I love food, and usually my ED the past few years has been manageable and not unsafe, but this past year during Covid my ED has kicked into full gear I think.I just needed to spew all this out and I'm glad I found this forum page.

It used to be that nighttime was worse, and it still is, but it has become an even stronger pull around the clock from the moment I wake up to when I fall asleep, if I fall asleep. I've gone to therapy for a solid two decades, going through grief and trauma healing; I'm constantly recommitting each day to take care of my body without restricting, without overly exercising, without binging and purging. I think this is the first time in my life I've started to say this is addiction and depression at work and no matter how much I reconcile my past trauma or cultivate habits good for my life, I have to get more help than do it alone because this is taking me over. If I really allow myself to feel the way I really feel, I feel angry. I have been telling myself that it's me who made bulimia in my life. Somehow blaming myself for it made it more easy to say I can change it as though I have total control. But part of me really feels addition and depression found its way into my life and body and I have to recover from it. I'm confused by how I even start this path of recovering.

201,goldfishinatank,12/14/2020,Tough Decisions,"Hey everyone, this is my first time posting on one of these but after having a really terrible day, I thought it might help. I’ve been aware of my disordered eating habits for a long time, longer than I’ll probably ever admit, but these past few months have been especially rough. Around 4 years ago I made the decision to adopt a specific diet (not for restriction purposes but for moral beliefs). About a year later I began to realize that I didn’t feel healthy on my diet and that I wasn’t getting proper nutrients, so after lots of thinking, I began a less restrictive diet. I’ve been on this diet for the past 3 years and as my ED has gotten worse, I’ve started to think about allowing myself to eat any food without restriction. The thing is, my diet never originated as a way to lose weight, but because I personally felt uncomfortable eating certain foods. Now, I’m struggling between my morals and my physical health and the question if I should allow my diet to include whatever food regardless of what it is. I’m trying my best to work towards recovery, and I know this would be a major step but for some reason I just can’t allow myself the option to eat whatever I want. Anyways, if anyone else has struggled with this while working towards ED recover, is there any advice you might have? Thank you.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,12/15/2020-9:09am","Hi Goldfishinatank,","Hi Goldfishinatank, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove details about your diets, which could be triggering to other members.

216,KatyaAismeer,11/26/2020,Recovery Symptoms,"Hi all, last Wednesday I learned that I have been severely undereating to the point that I've been consuming about half the calories I need per day, probably for two years. I'm sure this deficit was increased in July when I had an allergic reaction and cut out most of my snack foods because of it. I don't have the psychological component of anorexia, but I can't find anything else that matches my experience. From August to October, I got increasingly worrying symptoms seemingly out of nowhere: shortened and delayed periods, increased headaches, persistant fatigue and exhaustion, feelings of fainting, high heart rate, significant nausea in the mornings. I tanked two weeks ago and haven't felt any better since then. When I realised I had been eating below the minimum, I began to increase to the minimum for a 24yr old woman, and in the eight days since this realisation I've gotten up to what I should be eating per day. By day two, I was feeling very hungry and able to eat more; day 3 i was miserable and barely able to eat what I needed. I've been to the ER twice for an episode of orthostatic hypotension/feeling of passing out, and today because I have been having EXTREME persistent nausea, have had some leg pains, tingling, etc., and i chatted with the helpline today and they said that could be severe (i had been worried about potential refeeding syndrome). My phosphorous was *slightly* low, but everything looked good otherwise. I am at a total loss here because I can't find anything about extreme nausea in recovery. I have never had this much nausea before, but now I've had it for the week before I learned about and changed my diet, and now for over a week after even though I'm eating what I'm supposed to. The nausea is incredibly bad in the morning and usually feels better upon eating, but today it didnt.
It's completely debilitating and I haven't been able to work for two weeks because I can barely stand or hold my head up on days I like today where it's so extreme. Has anyone here experienced severe persistant nausea, especially in the mornings, at the beginning of recovery? Half of the time, I'm still hungry during the nausea! I read that the gut can feel full while the brain is still hungry. If you've experienced this severe nausea and exhaustion, when did it start to normalize for you? I feel so miserable and have no idea how to feel better.

217,Octopie,11/24/2020,Major ED Relapse,"Hi everyone I'm posting because Ive been keeping all this inside, and I just want to get it off my chest. TW!!!
A few years ago I lost weight through diet and exercise, right at the end it started to become unhealthy, with major restriction and binging (and purging). I knew it was too much so I stopped counting calories and just tried to eat healthy/ maintain exercise, which helped. I also went through therapy and intuitive eating, aiming to underpin the cause of my fear of weight gain (low self esteem, among other things).
Earlier this year, due to a hectic schedule I stopped being able to exercise and lost my progress, I haven't been able since to regain it. I also began comfort eating again but my problems only really restarted in the past month, when I moved back to live with my parents. My dad constantly buys chips, chocolate, popcorn, cheese and brings home different pastries and things to eat. I do treat myself to them, but I never have them lying around the house because I know it will make me binge and overeat. And I have been, in just the past few weeks I've gained almost 10lbs and the weight gain has made me start to purge. I am terrified of being ""fat"" and will ask anyone multiple times a day if I look different. I can feel myself very rapidly getting worse, sometimes purging multiple times per day.
My face is so swollen and disgusting, I can feel a double chin. I feel hyper aware of all the fat in my body and have only been wearing super loose clothes and still I'll randomly pinch and grab at my fat. I'll start a new day and plan to get back on track but have no motivation to exercise, or if I do I'll be constantly aware of the jiggle of my fat and my rolls. Even if I start the day off with a healthy meal, it won't be long till I binge on cake or chips etc. I feel disgusting. I have a boyfriend and I'm terrified of him seeing me. I want to break up with him because he deserves so much better. I haven't told him about the extent of what is going on with me because I'm terrified he will see the real me and want a break up.
Friends and family are quite active and have better self control than me, I feel so threatened and everytime I open social media and see ""weight loss"", it triggers the desire to purge in my brain. I am struggling more than I ever have, I currently am unable to go to therapy and honestly am just seeking any help at all.

221,MuchLikeFalling,11/21/2020,First time,"Hi everyone,This is my first time on a forum talking about my bulimia. I haven't really talked openly about this to anyone so here goes... Umm it's been about eight years since I first started and it's been pretty consistent. I was able to stop for almost a year a couple years ago, but I relapsed right before one year and have been binging/purging since. Sometimes I can go weeks without doing it, other times I find myself purging twice a day (although that's been more rare recently). I'm not sure what to do. I'm getting pretty fed up with myself, because I know I'm strong enough to get myself back on track but I don't. I relapse. Right now, I'm also worried that it's beginning to become more physical for me. I've had a constant runny nose for about a month and occasionally it'll have some blood. I get headaches, have a hazy brain most of the time, and I'm always tired. I'm 27 right now and I just want to be okay.

222,CASACERA,11/15/2020,There is no help for me,"Fine therapist who is sincerely trying but my compulsive overeating food addiction stays barricaded behind a powerful wall despite life long sensible efforts to at least push it back into the corner and give me a break. When I was in this state previously I'd leave my home where my eating disorder plagues me and go to a place of safety a residential  spa, center, hospital etc. Was going to start a group in one of my blessed periods of remission called ""Been there, done that"". But,remission now a memory. Covid 19 prevents my traveling etc. The other complication is a condition of chronic constipation stopping my going somewhere away from my home. I'm not alone, my husband is here and loves me but can only do so much to help. My out of control eating addiction finds a way. If this were a hard drug there is 24/7 support. But I wouldn't and have never touched the stuff or have had any other addiction behavior. Most people (friends. family etc.) dismiss my condition because I'm not obese. Could be very easily if I didn't try so hard to stay healthy and at a reasonably normal size for me.

226,cooky,11/18/2020,Trudging The Path of Recovery on My Own,"I have been recently trying to get treatment for my ED. I have been in such a bad funk lately that I have been eating significantly less and rarely getting out of bed. Covid-19 did not help with that and lead to my dad getting laid off twice and leaving my family as a whole struggling to make ends meet while I am trying to finish my senior year of college. This only has just added to my already poor eating.I have a lot of things that I really want to be able to accomplish, but my motivation to eat and get out of bed needs to be there so that I can do what I want to do. I want to get back into dancing and sword fighting and take up powerbuilding once I can finally go back to a gym. These all make me so happy and feel so free, but, I can't seem to get remotivated to eat what I need to at the moment.I tried to get a job so I could pay for treatment, but my mom would keep me from going to any interviews as she's terrified of everyone but me catching covid and doesn't want me putting everyone at risk because they're high risk. The only problem is that I'm also high risk and she doesn't like to mention that. She also thinks that my ED is an excuse so she has no idea that I was seeking treatment. My dad has been my support system in all of this, but I can't ask him to contribute to the cost so I wanted to pay for treatment myself. They already have such a financial burden just raising me and getting me to be a first generation college student. I don't want to put any more financial stress on them. I'm very frustrated that I have gone to 3 different local treatment centers and I was turned away from all 3 of them. I feel that it may have been because we're not insured. I just don't really know what to do to get myself back on the path of recovery since I don't know what triggers my ED deep down and I've never gotten treatment before. I really want to recover, but I just don't know what to do at this point. My body is giving up even though my brain says ""I should be doing this,"" but I just can't will my body to do anything. Any advice? If anything I at least want to get out of this funk so I can get myself eating a little more again.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,11/19/2020-3:04pm",Dear cooky,"We are sorry to hear you are struggling and having difficulty finding treatment options.

228,Finding_somethi...,11/15/2020,Hopelessness and pain in legs ,"Hi everyone. Short rundown, I had a pretty severe relapse in anorexia, losing about X pounds. I went to treatment in late July and have since gained all that back. I’m struggling listening to hunger that exists past my minimum meal plan because I already gained from those minimums. I went to res but insurance forced me to step down after a week. Then 2 for php. I’m in a different treatment center now and doing better but I feel like I need to go back to php. My treatment is already labelled by family as a disruption and “too time consuming”. Moving to PHP would be doubling it. I’m afraid I won’t be strong enough to maintain recovery with even more pushback, especially because I have to be at my parents for a month during winter break. I have trauma there and it’s especially bad in winter. I’m diagnosed with ptsd and it gets bad during November- January. I feel like it’s hopeless to try and recover during this time. I feel trapped and lost. As for the pain, if I stay on my feet for lounger than about an hour, I get this persistent aching pain from my hips down afterward. It usually goes away once I sleep for the night. But it’s not comfortable and I’m concerned it may be related to bone density (I’ve had my ED since I started puberty, it’s been 8 years, I’m 20 now). I’m afraid to ask doctors in case I get dismissed because I’m not thin. They always ask if I binge (I don’t) because I’m not the picture of anorexia and my body gains so fast when I start eating. I don’t have the emotional strength to challenge authority in my life, which is trauma related. I am exhausted, I’m sad, and I feel like my life will just be this cycle of relapse and attempts to recover. I feel like if I don’t lose more weight I’ll never be taken seriously enough by insurance or a recovery team to get the help I need.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,11/16/2020-8:40am",Finding_somethi...,"Hi Finding_somethi…, thank you for posting to the forums.

Now I feel extra anxious to walk to work. Last night I was crossing street in the dark to come home. As I made it to the mid road barrier, this huge White Ford 250 Bad A-- truck, came very quickly, towards the left turn lane.I felt a bit spooked. Not 1 car was on my side of the road. It was Totally safe and clear to cross. Then his truck had planned to do a quicky U-Turn, in mean spite and willfulness, regardless of his light being Red..., and turn me into 6PM-Road Pizza.I feel like he was being timely on purpose and that makes me feel very upset that there are these types of drivers on the road and they enjoy ruining a good persons feeling of safety....So now am getting ready to walk to work, and cross at the same darn intersection in about 45 minutes from now. I need my caffeine pill just to feel focused enough to get out the door, and feel like I have energy to get through work this afternoon.My hair is just so darn out of control, my control, and totally bulked up, chunked out, and voluminous.

235,zaffiedil,06/18/2020,New and uncomfy,"Hi all,
I am extremely new to do this and have never really openly talked about my issues with food. For starters, i have never been formally diagnosed with an eating disorder and im honestly not sure if I would like too. I dont know if what im experiencing is considered an eating disorder or something. However, within the past year I have had issues with eating, my weight and food in general and at this point its the only thing I really think about or care about. Growing up, I was always overweight and didn't eat right, which I acknowledge. However, I never actively tried to get healthy or to get to a healthy weight. My weight didn't really matter to me so I never thought about it. Though within this past year, I just felt so distressed about my appearance and so I turned to severe restricting and over excercising. I don't know honestly how I fell down the hole, it seemed to happen so quickly, but within 6 months I had lost almost half of my body weight and was continuing to lose. I was severly restricting, and over working my body in order to continue to lose weight and avoid food. My coworkers, family, and friends all noticed my rapid weight loss and several expressed concern over it, though I just played it off and said it was from me working so much (I was working 50+ hours a week in a restaurant). I eventually began to experience the negative impact of avoiding eating and I experienced a bunch of different medical issues, which are all still an issue and scare me. Calories and weight loss just consumed my life; I have tried to become better and work on my rituals and restrictions by myself though Ive gotten to the point where I know I cant do it alone. I think my family knows that theres something going on, though choose to not comment on it. I dont want to bring it up, or talk to them about it-- I get immense anxiety thinking about talking about my issues with them, and would rather avoid the entire experience all together. That being said, I would like to begin therapy and try to establish some form of recovery but I know I can't get away without my family knowing about it. I am just lost, and don't know who to turn to. I still am struggling with restricting and obssessing over my weight. Its my entire life now and I just dont know how to fix it.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,06/18/2020-2:41pm",Dear zaffiedil,"We are sorry to hear you are struggling and wanted to send some additional resources your direction.

242,Aimsley81,10/08/2020,"Abandoned, rejected and feel like a lost cause","I’m at an extremely low point in my life right now. In July/August I was receiving inpatient treatment for my ED then the hospital went into lockdown because of a new COVID-19 break out. My borderline personality disorder behaviours got so bad that they just let me go home. I’ve been out of hospital for just over a month now and my ED is at the worse it’s ever been. On Monday I started experiencing heart palpitations and was having major postural tachycardia. I went through the embarrassing ordeal of being taken to hospital by ambulance from a shopping centre I was at when the symptoms got worse. I got taken back to the same hospital I was at previously and the doctor in emergency said I was being admitted for the tachycardia. Then they checked my bloods and my potassium was also low. Because of that I had to have potassium via IV and was put on the ED protocol and had an NG tube inserted - which was not optional.  I was also told that I’d be staying in medical for 7 days to go through the re-feeding process (nil by mouth and Xml daily of water only).For some reason my potassium got lower even after the NG tube feeds had started and I had to have 4 more bags of potassium by IV. The second day was really boring. Had the dietitian see me to explain the protocol and when the feeding rates would be increased. Was reviewed by the medical team as well as psych. I told them that I was starting to feel ‘hungry’ and that was making me really anxious as I wanted to binge, so I got additional meds written up to help with that. Day 3 and I was reviewed by the medical team. I told them about my hunger issues. They left and a nurse came and increased the rate of my tube feeds from Xml to Xml. The nurse said they were now bypassing the protocol and putting me straight up to the highest rate. Then I had another review with psych who said that I had been cleared by the medical team and would be discharged that afternoon. I was so confused. I’d told them how low I was feeling, how poorly my eating was (non-existent) and how much I’d self-harmed.I’m at a complete and utter loss. I always thought that if I told them the truth and how badly I was struggling I would get the help that I so desperately needed, but I guess I’m not sick/thin enough to meet their criteria. My BPD did not handle this rejection well at all. I feel like a lost cause and untreatable. My psychologist called me that afternoon and I was just a mess. I reluctantly went and saw her today and told her that I’m done with all treatment and therapies. I told her that I just want to curl up and die and that if I get any symptoms like last time I’ll just let them get worse until i just collapse wherever I am. I don’t see the point in wasting more of anyone’s time seeing as I’m in the ‘too hard’ category.

248,lyssalou,10/14/2020,Freaking out a little,"Earlier this summer I was diagnosed with gastroparesis and it lead to an admittance that I struggle with bulimia. I've had disordered eating since I was in grade school after my family went on South Beach and I lost X lbs (that I needed to lose). I became obsessed with trying to keep the number on the scale down and would restrict certain food groups to lose a few pounds every few weeks. In college I struggled by seriously limiting what I would eat because I was so afraid of weight gain. Since I graduated, I have been gaining some weight because I'm not running competitively anymore. I've been trying to follow my nutritionist's goals for me to not skip meals, but I've gained like X more pounds and I'm freaking out that my metabolism is permanently damaged and I'm just going to keep gaining weight no matter what I do. I workout like X days a week because I enjoy it and for my mental health. I feel like I need to do something to lose some weight. I've dealt with this for so long now I'm afraid I can't even learn what normal eating is. My coworkers keep leaving a bunch of sweets out at work and I work third shift so I find myself eating in secret during work.

254,2Healthy4me,10/14/2020,Went Shopping and Purchased a Few Items NOT on My LIST,"So when I arrived home I had purchased at least 4 items, trigger foods, that were not on my list. My period has skipped a week and am having PMS cravings really badly. I binged on these naughty foods. I looked at the Cals after eating the snacks I purchased and was very surprised to see that they were much higher than I thought when I put them into my shopping cart. I ate rather quickly and at the time w/o remorse. Now my stomach is extra bloated and I'm feeling guilty for having a High Calorie Binge just few minutes ago. I usually do well on sticking to my shopping list but nervous of returning to work for another few days from 8-5 schedule. I hate early morning shifts. When I feel anxious or like its not in my choosing to do something, like work an early shift, I tend to feel extra mad at myself for feeling weak and thus extra anxious over a schedule which I can't predict. Then i get 3 days off from work. I was as good as an angel for the past 2 days. But tonight i work and this is the day of my Big Cal Binge B4 work tonight.....Hate feeling dizzy and weak when I am not eating much on days off from work. No energy to go out and even do anything fun on these days off from work. When I must work a day shift, this seems to be the only time I must eat regular meals. We take breaks at work about every 2.5 hrs. They always remind me of when my meal time is. So I have gotten use to eating during break times at work or shoppiung for items for my breaks such as Ice Cold Tea or band aids, etc...Worried that my period hasn't arrived this month on time, as last month it arrived and before that it had skipped a good 3 months. This is stressful for me too. I hate dealing w/ bloating and sweet cravings b4 my period. Then when it's delayed I crave foods like this for even more days than I should, and don't drop weight as no period = no end to my PMS bloating or cravings.

I am a former Bulimic and then Binge Eating Disorder and Night Eater.  I now still struggle with BED but not as much (my binges aren't as huge) but consistently struggle obsess with eating plans and changing my mind as to what to do with my food and exercise.  The silly thing I have noticed a lot of youtube or tiktok videos where people are recovering from eating disorders and they are saying things such as they do not restrict what they eat.  They eat 3 meals a day with a couple of snacks.  Is this the general eating plan for recovery?  Is there a book on this somewhere?  I have so many questions but this is where I'm starting.  I've never had counseling for an eating disorder but have handled this all myself for years.  Counseling sounds great but just expensive.,_admin_moderator,"Sun,10/11/2020-10:42pm",LuluBelle,"Hi LuluBelle – welcome to the forums!

260,2Healthy4me,10/03/2020,"I Experienced a ""Momentary Lapse of Reason"" and fell down.....","I was going to go for my usual evening, after dinner stroll. The smoke in the air was heavy and the climate felt hot and muggy. As I climbed down the stairs, as usual, I missed the last 3 steps and ended up on the base of the stairs on my bare knees. I felt so embarrassed and yet in so much pain with newly scraped and bloody knees. My feeling embarrassed got off my knees. Pulled my thigh muscles, getting up from a kneeling position, which is how fell on my knees. I limped into my apartment and had to scrub off my bloody knees and apply bandages. Thank God i had just an few good knee size, first aid band aids laying around the bathroom cabinet. This was like an act of God, as the muggy, hot, smoky air outside really wasn't conducive to my taking an evening walk anyhow. The ER wanted me to come in for a quick check but i had already taken my rx strength pain reliever, and was feeling very tired and just wanted to go to sleep, not travel to an ER, wait hours and then be seen and told that was all I needed anyhow. The weird thing is I don't recall losing my footing. I skipped 3 steps and all recall was getting up off my badly scraped up knees? I must be more careful I suppose, I had skipped dinner and was planning to eat after I had finished my walk. I do usually eat something substantial b4 a walk at night. Oh well, I must try and be more careful. I am NOT getting any younger, but thank God was raised by X drinking parents who didn't believe in Low-fat for children whose bones were still forming. (Thanks mom n dad). I went to work early the next day and gritted my teeth whenever I had to bend for something, and walking hurt. I bought first aid Band-Aids that were giant sized and New Skin spray for the fresh scrapes just below my knees.

264,Riivka,09/30/2020,Attempting Recovery - Hitting Setbacks,"Hi all. I started counting calories at 16 which spiraled into anorexia and then bulimia. I was recently diagnosed with OCD at 23 which has made recovery quite a challenge (my brain really likes to hold onto numbers). I'm seeking out RDs in my area, but I'm curious to see how those who are self-recovering are managing. I have tried mindful/intuitive eating, but it always stresses me out to relinquish control (I know, I know, that's the point of an ED). Counting calories makes me feel good for a week... and then it's back to square one with obsession. I had a REALLY bad binge/purge session last night and my brain is screaming at me to not eat today, but I know that will only exacerbate the problem. On the other hand, I'm afraid eating will trigger my OCD and I'll be stuck in an obsessive loop all day. I am getting help for the OCD, but it's still under new management, if you will.

268,ecdysis,09/25/2020,Moderation or abstinence?? Please help!,"Hey everyone!This is my first post on this website. I hope this doesn't trigger anyone, I've just been driving myself crazy recently and desperately need to hear some other perspectives.I have dealt with anorexia/binge eating/compulsive eating for years now. Although things are better than they used to be, they are certainly not 'normal' and seem to be getting worse the longer I ruminate on this topic. I have researched eating disorders exhaustively and have come to see how they mimic addiction; many books suggest that it is certain compounds in foods that make them so addictive and cause cravings etc. etc. and, therefore, should be abstained from in a similar manner to which an alcoholic would completely avoid alcohol. I have tried this method and had some luck. However, more recently I have started a relationship and suddenly I have to consider someone else's interests and desires; though abstinence may be possible on an individual level, it seems impossible to have a relationship whereby I cannot attend family dinners/restaurants/go on holidays abroad and enjoy new foods due to my abstinence. I feel as though I am going insane and the pressure is starting to build as I feel increasingly guilty about avoiding dinners at his family home and increasingly worried about the prospect of eating abroad. Moreover, this whole scenario is increasing my obsession surrounding food! I am currently completely lost and feel as though I don't know which direction to go in: should I try to ease my rules around food instead in the hope that I will become less obsessed that way, or create tighter rules so that I don't have to worry about attempting (and potentially failing) at moderation. Please help!Surely this is a problem that someone has dealt with and can offer some advice towards?? Perhaps someone who has strictly adhered to a keto/atkins/paleo diet?? TLDR; think it is in my best interest to give up these foods completely but not sure how to deal with dinner at friends' house/restaurant meals/eating out on holiday. Am unsure as to whether attempting moderation of certain foods would ease obsession or whether it would increase food anxiety further.",_admin_moderator,"Sat,09/26/2020-2:14pm",Welcome!,"Hi ecdysis, welcome to the forums!

275,Aimsley81,09/22/2020,Feeling abandoned....,"Hi there,I’m a new member and just wanted to reach out and get some thoughts, opinions or advice from anyone willing to offer it. So where do I start? I’m 38 and I’ve been living with an eating disorder for the past 8 years. It has changed over time but my current diagnosis is anorexia - binge/purge subtype. I also have borderline personality disorder. My behaviours were becoming so unbearable and at the beginning of the year I reached out to my GP for some treatment. My last lot of treatment was over 7 years ago and it was a terrible experience and I was terrified about the thought of having to go through all of that again. But I decided that I needed to try. I got referred to see someone at a local hospital as an outpatient who could then refer me on to the appropriate program I needed. I only had two appointments with him but we talked a lot about my history and agreed that going for inpatient treatment would be a much better option due to my declining health. So I went on the waiting list and I finally got the call back in July that a bed had become available and I needed to go to the emergency department to be processed and then transferred to the mental health unit. Unfortunately my body decided that was not to be the case and I needed to stay in the medical ward for 10 days due to low potassium. I had the very unpleasant experience of having my first NG tube - which was not negotiable. When I was finally medically cleared to be transferred I had to wait for another bed to become available, delaying the process even further. To cut a long story short, I spent a total of 5 weeks on the mental health ward getting inpatient treatment for my ED. It was a really good program. There was 5 of us ED patients and I had a great team of nurses, doctors, social worker, psychologist, dietitian, registrar and psychiatrist. We had supportive meal therapy 6 times a day, one-on-ones with each of the team, team reviews twice a week and music therapy. They also had a ‘leave’ program that you made your way through as you progressed in treatment. In 4 weeks I had finally made it to level 2 where I would be allowed 2 hours of leave off of hospital grounds and had to have a meal or snack in that time. It was not to be as we had our second outbreak of COVID-19 and the hospital went into full lock down - no leave and no visitors. My last week in hospital I was in full self-destruct mode and my BPD was in full swing. To my huge surprise they gave me weekend leave and I got to go home. I was so happy to be going home but that was not without its challenges as I’m living with my parents and they’ve been so unsupportive for my recovery. I was home less than 24 hours when I completely relapsed after one of the comments my mother made to me. I have now been home for 3 weeks and my ED behaviours are worse than ever. As I’m on a Treatment Authority I’ve attended every one of my outpatient appointments and have been completely honest with my team about everything that’s been happening.  Even after telling them all this, the psychiatrist still discharged me. I’m just at a complete and utter loss. I feel really cheated out of this opportunity of a really good inpatient program and just feel completely abandoned. I should have been inpatient for 3 months, working my way through the leave program and participating in eating challenges but instead I got sent home with no support, no therapy and basically no hope. Thoughts, feelings and behaviours have gotten extremely bad - in all areas. And I have told all of this to my GP, psychologist, psychiatrist and occupational therapist. I’m also so disappointed in myself for not being stronger and letting the comments my parents have made to me get to me. I’m also waiting on a medical clearance before I can return to work so my days are long and boring and I’m not able to get out much due to an injury in my left ankle that’s causing significant pain. I’m just feeling so down about my current situation and feel so trapped. Sorry this post was so long.

Currently, I have a therapist online, X. Sometimes it is helping, and sometimes, it wasn't helping. Right now, I wasn't happy with that. I felt like I want to give up like X that, I don't want to get help anymore. I'm struggling because everything is changing when CODVID-19 hits. My anxiety is increasing because I fear I gain the weight, I'm scared that my family will sabotage my diet(my comfort zone) because I'm not ready to out of my comfort zone of food. It is difficult for me. Feelings took me down, and I don't want to deal with it anymore. I want to get better health, but at the same time, I want to lose weight more. I don't know how to change.

277,alaynaofavalor,09/17/2020,I feel like I have a unique situation any advice would mean the world ,"havent been diagnosed professionally, but i as far as i know i was having anorexic tendencies for about 6 months.
in the beginning of quarantine i wanted to lose some fat and i began excercising everyday and eating at a deficit. when i first noticed it working i became infatuated with it i was working out. i am an athlete, so my body was never very thin to begin with, i had more muscle mass across my body than fat and i was getting by my whole life on over X calories a day. when i reduced my calories at first i was very hungry but i refused to eat past the limit I gave myself. id notice that if i did, id gain weight immediately the morning after and so i kept it strict to X and so on. this continued about 5 months and it wasnt until I had some weird symptoms that i realized i had a problem. i would also body check everyday, constantly measure myself and i would refuse to eat certain foods. id check every ingredient of what i ate and track my calories everyday and making sure my diet was filled with “whole” foods. i think orthorexia is what they call it but i dont want to diagnoss myself. and actually thinking about this, these arent normal behaviors ive realized that now. my diet was actually very horrible my whole life and until quarantine id never gained any weight until soccer stopped and i wasnt active. id never worked out before until then and looking back i wasnt even “fat” i was actually very slim and i just couldnt see it. i just want to get out of this mindset and idk how. i asked my mom to take me for my physical but told her it was just for soccer coming up since we need to be passed in the last 6 months beforehand. my doctor said i was at a healthy weight for my height and i tried explaining to her my worries about my symptoms and so on i gave her a summary of what was happening to me but she basically just dismissed it as “oh it’s normal for someone your age” and giving me all the doctor talk not helping me at all. ive tried confiiding in my sister as well but she is self obsessed didnt really seem to actually care and basically continues to make everything in the family about her. i tried even hinting to my mom and she closed me down. i didnt know what to do but i didnt want to feel unhealthy and unenergized anymore and at the time i was ready to accept the fact id gain weight to get better. i decided to try to help myself and im now doing the best i can to gather the correct information on getting better and its been very hard. i keep seeing that when people start to eat more they will gain weight but as time goes on it will be evenly distributed and somewhat youll fill in in all the right places with time, but does that go for me as well? since im at a healthy weight and i was never considered unhealthily skinny before? i have been starting to eat when im hungry and listening to my body, and ive tracked my calories judt to see about how much that is, and it seems my body is satisfied at around X per day. ive stopped all excercise except for soccer practice X days a week. ive already noticed water retention and weight gain only X days in and i keep trying to stay positive telling myself itll all work out but since my situation is different it feels like the weight i gain wont redistribute after all. i feel horrible when i eat everyday physically, i bloat A LOT and it makes me feel worse so ive been trying to eat low fiber which is denying my of some of my favorite foods, since i like eating healthily i cant eat these without bloating up immensely and makes the weight gain seem worse. i was just wondering if you have any advice for me because i truly dont know what i should do. i feel as though im on the verge of starting up bad habits again and i want to get through this.
that was an email id try to get in contact with someone with a blog that sums up my situation. its been about a month since i took things into my own hands now. i want to get professional help but i dont want to cause a commotion in my family, (especially with money) or for my mom who works 24/7 as a single mom with 3 kids. ive taken the time to assess myself and im subtly restricting myself monitoring my calories and subconsciously not wanting to go X. ive also started soccer for X days a week now. the first 2 weeks were hell. i felt horrible everyday my only comforting thought was knowing i wasnt alone and other people go through this too. the bloating went down to a manageable level, the weight gain seemed to be proving a good thing, until almost overnight it seemed like i gained a ton more. ive been desperately trying to think positively and trying not to start excercising and restricting. school isnt helping either, i barely have enough motivation to do homework. any advice would help.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,09/18/2020-3:50pm",Dear alaynaofavalor,"We are sorry to hear you are struggling and wanted to encourage you to reach out to our confidential NEDA Helpline at 800.931.2237.

I couldn’t tell the doctor everything because I ended up crying too much, but she referred me to a psychologist in a hospital but said it could take 2-3 or more months cause of corona. Also now I’m underweight and I’ve lost my period, and the doctor said I have to gain more weight to get it back. Which is killing me, I check the scale A LOT and panic if I gain too much I really don’t know how to do it without getting even more depressed than I am now. Also I check the mirror an unhealthy amount so it’s gonna be even harder seeing my self gain weight, which is the opposite of what I want.

283,TryingToBeOkay,09/13/2020,Trying To Understand,"Right now I do not have a confirmed diagnosis but I realized a month ago I may need help. I have struggled with mental illness since my early teens and I think it took precedent over my physical health. During quarantine I have had a lot of time to think and it made me realize I need help. My breaking food was when I looked at the pantry when I was hungry I put myself in a shame spiral and sat on the floor and cried in my pantry for an hour for thinking about eating. My dad came home and found me and I couldn't move. I didn't know how to tell him that I thought I had an eating disorder. My parents still didn't even believe my diagnosis when the therapist had me come in for 3 years until I was at a breaking point.  Later that day when everyone had gone to sleep I binged on everything I wanted to eat and felt the guilt afterwards and got so upset I threw everything back up. This made me take a look at my life. I want to happy and healthy in my body but I when I went to the doctor and found out I had gained X pounds it made me never want to eat again. I was so confused at how this could happen because my body type never changed until 3 years ago. Growing up people would call me chicken legs and run away from my and say things like I could snap you in half. So I went into sports and tried to eat more and then people said I looked healthy and I thought I was okay. And now, this weight makes me not want to leave the house.I don't want to be around my friends who say I look fine when I can't even see a pudge in their stomach. Now people are saying it is in my head and that it is just skin. I feel like I am loosing my mind every time I look at food. I guess what I am saying is I am confused. I feel as though there is no one in my life who thinks this is real and I feel as though if I keep going like this it won't ever stop. I think this is my first step to asking for help and I would appreciate any I could get.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,09/13/2020-10:55pm",TryingToBeOkay,"Hi TryingToBeOkay, welcome to the forums!

In addition to feeling sick and being in a constant state of physical discomfort, I feel so completely empty and drained and not present with my body. I am operating on such a basic functioning auto pilot. At my job, I am an office assistant. I have administrative tasks as well as receptionist/phone duties. I feel so weird every time that I pick up the phone because the energy I have to use to sound polite and professional is so forced and I am not even fully conscious of what I am saying and being told. Even simple things are hard for me to be mentally engaged in, like watching movies or reading. Every day it seems like my brain is running at slow speeds or like I am disconnected from my body. I have had a much longer work commute because due to wildfire warnings, I was not able to be at my own home and have been staying with my mom. During these 1 hour and 15 minute drives, my head feels woozy and I feel like I am floating. I am trying to ignore thinking about gaining weight and just think about all of the ways in which I will feel better if I start eating more and get healthy. I have been so afraid of weight gain that I have not made any effort to eat enough to gain any pounds, but I am really tired of feeling like this and not being able to really do anything with my life because I am constantly tired and can’t think straight.

286,Fiona_the_human,09/06/2020,Questions about anorexia,"I believe that I have an undereating disorder, really only relating to anorexia. I don't focus on calories, but really on my weight. Nearly my entire life revolves around food. I just have a few questions because I don't completely understand everything.1) does anyone with anorexia not feel hunger anymore? I can't remember the last time I actually felt hungry and I was wondering if anyone else is going through this.2) does anyone else somehow always think of food, but always forget to eat?3) do you feel as if your sense of smell gets in the way of eating? If so, have you been able to work on getting past that. Personally, I have an extreme heightened sense of smell. If I smell food from a distance, I feel fine and like I could eat it. But as soon as I get close to food and smell ithe up close, it feels like a punch in the stomach and nose and I start feeling extremely sick. I then don't eat out of fear of throwing up. 4) as a followup to the last question, would going on a bland, scentless, diet help me eat more?Thank you for any responses or help.I appreciate any information I can get.

288,Seven,09/08/2020,Relapse - guilt ,"TW - Anorexia restricting/purging behaviours Also sorry this will be super long I hope one of you has the courage to read...Hi, this is my first time posting but I think I really need to get this out there, for once. A traumatic event triggered my anorexia about 2/3 years ago, and I truly hit rock bottom and it got to the point where I truly feared for my life. Since then it’s been fluctuating a lot, until I met my boyfriend, then I started being better. Like, really better. I wouldn’t stress about not being to able to purge after a getting lunch with my friends, I wouldn’t think about how much weight I’d gain from eating X. For the first time in years. But then I moved away for school and lived alone for the first time. By that I mean, I was already living alone in my hometown but not a day would go by that I didn’t see my sister, or boyfriend, or anyone else really. And being here just gives me too much time to obsess about food, to restrict, to purge. I’ve been staring at the X wondering if I can really get that X.
My doctor told me about a patient of hers that moved in with someone and immediately got better. I know for a fact that living with someone inhibits my ED.
My boyfriend and I would like to move in together but he works in our hometown and it’s complicated. His contract ends in a little over a week, but they’re offering a permanent contract. He wants to try to find another job closer to me but COVID might get in the way of that I guess, and regardless, what if he finds one but it’s not as good? I can’t possibly ask him to give up a job where he gets to see his friends everyday and make decent money, just for me. I haven’t told him how bad this “episode” is. I need support so badly, but I don’t want him to feel like I’m guilting him into moving in with me. On the other hand, I can’t do that anymore, I just need someone to be here so I avoid the purging/restricting cycle altogether. I’m considering moving in with flatmates but I have a big dog, and I love my flat, I live in an area where it’s super rare to get such a good deal on an apartment.
I want to talk to him but I’m so ashamed and afraid that he’ll be disgusted with me or wind up resenting me for being sick. I seemed like such a healthy person when we started dating and I just feel like I’m deceiving him by being a little bit broken. I just can’t stand being anything less than perfect, and perfectly happy. Right now, I’m a version of me that I thought I’d buried forever, and I never ever thought could be me again. I see it, and I just really don’t want him to see it too.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,09/08/2020-4:31pm",Dear Seven,Welcome to the forums!

289,Duchessofdork,09/07/2020,Is it possible to recover w/out specialized help?,"I have recently been diagnosed with anorexia and since I'm underweight and a tad malnourished, my psychiatrist who specializes in eating disorders would very much like me to check into a residential program. I'm not totally, totally opposed to it but because I have Medicare, she could only find one treatment center on the other side of the country. My business has been hit pretty hard since Covid so money is extremely tight so I'm not even sure if it's feasible. I'm motivated to get better because I'm actually moving in a great direction in my life and am very excited about it but am struggling to do it on my own.

290,2Healthy4me,09/06/2020,Extreme Weather Conditions Induce high Anxiety 4 Me,"The weather here in No Cal, USA is too hot 4 me to deal with. My lil pad is almost 100 degrees and its only 12:40. Extreme weather makes me feel extra anxious. Today I feel extra anxious. I need to p/u a few groceries today on my Blessed day off from work today. I feel anxious about even going outdoors but need to p/u my safe healthy snack foods for the next few days when i will be busy working. Still not working a FT schedule yet. The few scheduled days i do have off I need to use to run errands for the week. I miss my old pay scale since Corona was The Big Career Quake of my life, so far?????Working a retail job,which was my 2nd job before CV-19, is scary. I need to earn more and am still searching on my 1 or 2 days off during the week for a better paying primary job and the retail job would be my secondary job, like it was b4 CV-19.My appetite feels frozen today. I ate a healthy small breakfast, took my diet supplements, daily vitamins, and have no comfort food around for this hot weather.I am at a higher body weight currently.Not working 2 jobs has also increased my body weight,  and tone.It is not as it was when super busy running round w/ 2 jobs.This transition is not easy; everything feels up in the air for me.It's too darn hot for me to even think straight this afternoon.

292,PxmpkinSpice,07/30/2020,Struggling,"In my last post I talked about wanting to tell my parents about my anorexia. Last Friday, the 24th, I told my mom. She told me that she didn’t believe me because I ate, but she reluctantly agreed to get me a therapist. I have yet to hear an update on that. Just because I eat doesn’t mean I eat enough or at all when am I am by myself. I have always been a picky eater, and I’ve always eaten around friends and family to hide my eating disorder, so it hurts to see her not support me and also not believe me. Along with this, since I’m picky, when I refuse to try or eat something my mom now says “this is why you don’t eat,” publicly in front of the rest of my family. I now feel like in order to show her I’m not lying to her, I need to lose a tremendous amount of weight again, and I’m struggling with how to cope. I lost my appetite even more especially since I just recently experienced a breakup and am depressed.

I do not want to be naked on the phone with my boyfriend, or when I have to lotion, or when I am getting dressed to leave out... anything really. I am feeling lonely on this journey.

294,xomiyuh,08/23/2020,seeking help,"I have never done this before, so I am a bit nervous. I have suffered from eating disorders for as long as I can remember. Always feeling fat even at a healthy weight, not having an idea what my body actually looks like, going on every diet in the book, starving myself, working off twice as many calories as I’ve consumed, taking laxatives etc. Ive always felt different, fatter, uglier than most people when everyone seems to tell me differently. I am currently going through an episode of dysphagia for the past month which has caused me to drop in weight. Based on doctors visits X pounds and counting, but I am still considered a healthy weight. For me, even with me not eating I feel like I am just gaining weight. I kind of hoped it was medical related, but deep down knew it wasn’t. After going to different clinics, ER’s and doctors and running every lab under the book everything was normal. The only thing keeping me running was a bottle of nutrition drink and some water. I’m severely dehydrated and starving, but still won’t eat. I know I need help, but I feel like I won’t be taken seriously because I don’t look like I have an eating disorder. I just don’t want to feel this way anymore.

I'm Racing w/ the clock, i feel, and need to find a better paying job,  w/ PM shift, or decent regular day shift.I may have a 2nd interview. I would work 30 hours per week. ( Dracula hours).Now checking emails on 2 emails ED.Last I worked @ this job when aged 33-35, I almost enlisted in the Marines.Then I was told by the Recruiter that I was over the Acceptable Weight cut off.So then I retired from my retail job at age 35. I took a bunch of college classes in Health. I enrolled in swim classes 2 classes meeting 4 days a week.I joined a gym.I saw a Dietitian.They started me out on herbal energy medicine and weekly B-12 shots.I kind of became Totally Obsessed w/ Exercising, and dropping weight. I was 2 old to enlist after age 35, though had already passed the ASVAB pre enlistment exam of very Basic logic, basic math, English,  and mechanical questions(which i didn't have a clue about).I was so obsessed w/ my weight and exercising that i 4got why i was trying to lose weight.I was able to fit into a swim suit so felt great about that.When i realized that I was now past 35, I felt so navy blue. I felt guilty for my original body weight.I am back at Point A again, same retail store job, only 20 yrs later. I feel like a run in a nylon.I look in the mirror and just see how much weight gained since March when CV-19 kept me inside and sheltered, until the beginning of July. Now my clothes fit snug and I feel ashamed after dropping weight and not exercising after to maintain my weight loss.I feel like I'm anemic, can't eat large meals, or at a table in front of others, or in a formal setting.My eyes are dry.They feel brittle and like their gonna shatter.I look at the # on the scale in the morning and this sets the pace of my eating style for the rest of my day.I tried to see how many berries i could eat off a tree this evening, had a few, and nothing has happened yet.My New pillows are Not my New best friend.I use my old pillow under my neck because...when I woke up the 1st  morning after using a firm overly Stuffed pillow,    I felt dizzy.The new pillows are now my leg rest pillows, and have resorted back to familiar, soft, low fill pillows, definitely Not Overstuffed.

297,whiteblossom05,08/19/2020,I'm new and overwhelmed,"I've been reading a lot of the past few threads and feel horrible. I've been struggling with binging for only a few months and I'm losing hope quickly. A lot of people mentioned struggling with their ED's for a long time and I'm so scared. I want to get better so badly, and I'm really really trying.      I read a few articles online telling me that your eating disorder might go away but the little voices/thoughts in your head promoting your ED stays (like wondering how many calories are in something, or restriting, etc.). Reading that genuinely scared me and made me wonder if I'll truly always be like this?      I've been working towards recovery with the help of my parents. My mom has been cooking meals for me and took away all of my food scales and measuring tools. With this change I was determined I was getting better and allowed myself to have what I wanted in a pretty giving moderation but still ended up binging today.     I think I'm honestly just looking for some encouragement and comfort, sorry. I just need to know that it'll get better.

298,BuNnY1216,08/20/2020,Feel Ignored,"I think I have anorexia and depression and I am here because I don't know what else to do. This is my first post so here goes:
I told my parents about how I was struggling and that I want/need help, but they think it is just a phase. They are being very supportive but they don't see that this is an actual problem. They said that I was being ""sensitive"" and that everyone goes through this and that I'm just not able to handle it. I've recently started thinking that this is too hard and I wish everything would just stop. My hair keeps falling out and I haven't had my period in 7 months. I keep looking in the mirror and feeling so fat and I have literal folders full of names of food and I don't know why but I can't stop. Everyday is crying and even I know that sometimes I have emotional outbursts. I feel really bad and feel really selfish because I know my parents are trying their hardest and sometimes I think maybe I am just sensitive and I should be able to deal with this alone. Lately, I've been trying to get better and eat more food/less exercise and conquer certain fear foods without having a ""cheat day"" and beating myself up the next day but it is so hard sometimes because my whole family is now becoming super diet-conscious and THEY are decreasing their portions and exercising more . It makes me happy that they are being healthier but at the same time it makes recovery really hard for me and also sometimes makes me think that it all my fault. I really want to be happy and normal again but I feel like everyone has given up and I have emotionally drained them. I also feel really emotionally drained and have just kind of given up on everything too. I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense, as I'm not that good at putting my thoughts into words.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,08/20/2020-1:13pm",Welcome!,"Hi! Thank you for posting.

299,walker94,08/17/2020,8 years in,"First time saying this outloud in a while...Started when I was 17 to lose weight — healthy eating and purging. My craving binges became more extreme when I saw that I could control the fact that it wouldn’t affect my weight. Friends and family caught on, but I convinced them I had stopped.18-23, I purged daily. Sometimes once, sometimes full cycles of binge purge. My teeth lost all enamel and I had to get them fixed. I had always grinded my teeth so I was able to blame it on that. Also, I didn’t look bulimic anymore. I binged so heavy, stopped working out and binge drank on the weekend and gained more weight than felt healthy. That’s one of the hardest things to think about.24-25, now almost 26, I have a better control on it. I have a great boyfriend, a great job, I purchased a home... but I still sneak to purge. Typically only meals out or dinners at home in which I feel like I over indulged. I can’t go a whole week and I don’t know why. I’m working out more than I ever have, I “look” great, and doctors who don’t know I’m sick think that I’m in amazing shape and my bloodwork is perfect. I’m an activist in my community and I’m a loving supportive friend.I have this big secret that I forget is a secret, because it’s all I know. I can’t even cry about it because I don’t hate myself. I really don’t. If anything, I can be too confident in myself and my outward accomplishments. I’m in my best place yet and I think this is my time to get to recovery. I don’t have much auxiliary income for therapy but I’m ready to take steps. I don’t want to look at the love of my life, feel so happy, and think how I’m gonna escape to the bathroom at the restaurant. Not to mention, I know have extreme guilt for the food I’ve wasted over the years when people can’t afford to eat or don’t have access to meals. I don’t want to get sick when I’m older or have my teeth fall out or lumps in my throat. I’m not ashamed. I will talk about disorder to my friends and family, they just think it stopped when I was 18.

301,swamprosemallow,08/06/2020,Just want to feel better,"I've been struggling with disordered eating for about 3 years and it started out as just starving myself but for the past year I have been binging and it's only got worse since the pandemic. I am striving towards a career in dance so I have always been very focused on how my body looks which is probably a reason why I started unhealthy habits in the first place. Because I am so focused on eating healthy and being thin, its hard for me to tell how serious my disorder is and if I can recover without help. I may not be binging as often or as much as other struggling with the same disorder but the way I feel after a binge is very real and very scary. When I only starved myself I never wanted to seek help of tell anyone because it is what many dancers do. Now I want to get better and have a healthy relationship with food and my body. Some days I hate my body so much. I want to get more serious about trying to recover from this but I do not know what to do.
I opened up to my mom about it once when I was at a very low point but whenever she talks to me about it again I cannot speak, I feel like I just shut down. I am so ashamed of my behaviors I cannot share what I do or how I feel about it to my own mom. Often after I binge I become depressed for days and I feel very bad because my mom says things like ""I'm the worst mom, I can't help my own daughter, she won't talk to me"" which makes me more upset because its not about her and I don't want to make her feel guilty. I end up keeping everything inside so I don't make anyone feel bad. I feel like all my problems are weighing me down and I want to get better, I really do. I just can't see how I could open up to a stranger when I feel anxiety talking to someone so close to me.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,08/07/2020-3:53pm",Dear swamprosemallow,Welcome to the forums!

304,joyjoyjoy,08/14/2020,scared and don’t know what to do. ,"I’ve been dealing with body problems for about 3 years. I've tried purging and exercising just so i don’t gain. i never thought or considered having an eating disorder till a few weeks ago when i realized that i wasn’t in control of my life anymore. i thought i had fixed everything, but my mindset has never been in the right place. i worked out with a sprained ankle, after getting my wisdom teeth out, and when i was sick. I have tried different diets and i cannot find a way to enjoy eating. i’ve only told two people what my problems are. and i feel like i should tell my parents, but i don’t know how they will react. i’ve never felt alone with my body, and i just want freedom to live how i want. but i know i will never have it. i have been constantly working out for 3 years. I lost X in one summer, and at some point i gained it back, but now i’m X again. i weigh myself weekly, and whatever the scale tells me will either make me happy for crush me. when it gets lower and lower i get happy. i feel like i need to be thin to finally be happy with myself and who i am. i miss certain foods. i can’t bring myself to eat them or else my mind will make me feel like i just gained. ive been called out by people for sucking in my gut to look smaller, and i just feel so much shame. I dislike my body, and no matter what i’ve done, it’s not enough ever. but i’ve never felt like i had anyone on my side. i tell everyone that body confidence is key when i have none. i can’t wear bikinis or tank tops when i just want to feel great. and i could cry looking at pictures of myself cause some days i just feel that bad. i want to find help. i want to finally live. 3 years of my life have been taken. and i know if i keep going like this more will be taken. i was so stressed by my school and work schedule trying to slip in a workout in between, so i can keep up my figure and not lose it. i mean i can’t even find any rest. i will pace around the house to burn excess calories so i can feel good enough to eat another meal. i’ve skipped family meals cause i didn’t want to eat anymore calories. i hate how i live. but i can’t stop. help.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,08/14/2020-3:59pm",Dear joyjoyjoy,"We are sorry to hear you are struggling and wanted to encourage you to reach out to our confidential NEDA Helpline at 800.931.2237 M-Th 11am-9pm ET and F 11am-5pm ET for more resources and support.

306,deg96,08/13/2020,Struggling to accept recovery,"A few months ago my ED got a lot worse. I started purging after every dinner I ate and began binging a lot in the day with the intent to purge. I have lost a lot of weight over the past few months and now I struggle to eat a meal without feeling the impulse to purge. None of my clothes fit me and a lot of people are noticing my weight loss but I'm ashamed to tell people that I have an ED. I have stomach pains whenever I eat, I'm dizzy a lot, I'm tired a lot, I sleep really badly and have headaches all the time. I was trying to do better by exercising and trying to get myself to eat three meals a day but the pain my body feels when I eat and the overwhelming fear of gaining weight that I have is setting me back. I know that physically I am hurting myself but it's like I can't control it. I don't have the ability to go to a clinic or get a therapist so I feel really stuck.

307,kick1224,08/13/2020,New and Unsure. Advice needed,"Honestly, I am writing this because I genuinely do not know if I have an eating disorder. I don't have a lot of the ""signs"", but I think I may have a few. I don't want to make a big deal of something or try to make it look like I want attention if this is nothing to be concerned about, but I recently have been worrying myself a little.  Back story: I am a collegiate athlete, and have been an athlete my entire life. I have always had a very fast metabolism and have been a ""thin"" girl. About a year ago, I suffered from a very serious injury that caused me to be completely on crutches for 6 weeks, slowly moving off crutches for 4 more weeks, and then no running for 3 months after that. Well, my stomach still thought I was doing as much activity as I was used to, but obviously I wasn't. I was always hungry, but I knew I didn't need the calories, and I could tell I was. This was the start of my issues. I had absolutely never had any problems, or anxiety, or even thought twice about what I was eating previous to this. However, I was in a spot where I couldn't help myself from eating, but I couldn't work it off. So, I started making myself purge. It wasn't every time- it wasn't even every day. Sometimes, I would just have a big meal, and decide to purge.
I feel like my problem wasn't even the purging, it was the fact that I couldn't get myself to stop eating. I would see a X, and know that I didn't need/want it, but I literally could not help myself. Flash forward to now. I don't really purge anymore (I still do occasionally, but it is rare. maybe about twice a month?). I am recovered from my injury, and am back to my usual (very extraneous) activity. My issue has now kind of morphed into just not eating. But it's so strange. I don't experience the extreme anxiety, or the calorie counting, or the dieting that so many people say they do. And I definitely do eat- especially in crowds. If I go to dinner with friends, I will get a meal and eat normally. It's when I am at home, and it's lunch/dinner time, and there is food on the counter or food in the fridge, and I will be doing something, and say in my head that I need to eat, but never make the effort to eat. I can't tell you how many times I make it to 4/5 pm and realize I haven't eaten anything. And I thought well ""you know I'm busy"" or ""there is nothing to eat"" and that's why I didn't eat. But I'm starting to notice that I do this even when there is food already prepped and I have nothing to do. I have gained weight throughout college, and I especially notice it in my face. I will go back and compare my pictures now with picture from when I was a freshman. But I don't know.. I guess I just don't know what's stopping me from getting up and eating. Cause even when I don't get up to go eat, I'm not consciously thinking ""I don't want to eat because I want to get skinnier"". I just don't eat. So I don't know if that's happening subconsciously or maybe I am over thinking all of this.I know this is really long, but some guidance or knowledge on eating disorders would be so helpful. Are these signs of a disorder even though they are not typical? Please help, and thank you.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,08/13/2020-3:33pm",Dear kick1224,We understand you have some questions and would like to encourage you to reach out to our confidential NEDA Helpline at 800.931.2237  M-Th 11am-9pm ET and F 11am-5pm ET for additional resources and support.

308,kieruns,08/09/2020,I Want Professional Help,"Five years ago, as a 7th grader and competitive runner and soccer player, I developed anorexia. As a child I was always a little overweight, and was very self conscious about that. After naturally shedding this weight my 6th grade year and finally feeling confident in my body, I committed myself to eating more healthy. This eventually spiraled into a full disorder- I lost X pounds over around 6 months. I was sent to a nutritionist and regained more normal eating habits, but I never went to therapy to recover from the mental aspect of my disorder. Fast forward to today and I still struggle so much with my body image- I still see myself as that child athlete who is overweight. I am going into my senior year of high school now. I have fluctuating periods of feeling decent about myself and having hope in physical (as well as mental) progress towards the body I want, followed by periods of crushing hopelessness where I am constantly bingeing until I no longer want to go out with friends, do my homework, exercise, etc, essentially developing a negative feedback loop for myself that lasts for a while. I have been more open with my mom about my issues now and in the past, which was a major barrier for me to overcome in the first place. I was naive, however, to think that this would solve my issues. I want to see a therapist so bad, but feel immensely guilty over the prospect of doing so. Eating has been the center stressor of my life for a long time!

310,SamIsTrying,08/08/2020,TikTok & EDs,"I didn't set out looking for ED tiktoks but I was scrolling thru my feed and their algorithm contributes to it because the more you like, the more suggested videos you get. I've been dealing with on and off again php and residential treatments for the past 3 years. I go thru periods of somewhat maintaince with periods of relapse. I don't know how I feel about ED tiktok yet. Like it's definitely better than the dark social media world I was into before my first treatment placement. I'm afraid to bring up looking at ED tiktok to my therapist. I'm curious if the ED recovery community sees it as a good thing or as unhealthy social media? I've had a few setbacks lately. Like a family member made me upset when eating dinner. I already had food thoughts making me upset and something happened at dinner. Instead of being able to express my feelings properly, I threw it and exploded it on the floor making a huge mess. After I cleaned it up I made excuses why I couldn't eat. Then I caught myself calming down watching ED tiktok. Kinda the same way I use to do with ED Tumblr. It's nice seeing other people talk about relatable things but idk if I can handle it.

311,bedathlete,08/04/2020,Fell off recovery plan and feel horrible,"Hi all, I'm new to the forum, and generally new to accepting I have an eating disorder - Binge Eating Disorder. In hindsight, I've had an eating disorder since I was probably 5 or 6 as part of emotional abuse from a parent. However, through childhood and early adulthood, I, an others around me, failed to acknowledge any issue due to the fact I was a competitive athlete. I went on to college athletics and eventually turned pro. The signs were there, but since I was exercising and practicing my sport for X hours a day, X days a week, I didn't gain weight, and actually lost it. I was eating a lot, and not healthily a lot of the time. I overate comfort food with little impacts since I was burning it off as quickly as I was eating it. After semi-retiring and dropping to semi-pro in my sport and starting law school, the ED started to snowball. At the same time, I was hiding who I was as a LGBTQ person, adding to my stress. I stopped exercising altogether except for sports practice. I started to eat comfort food every day, hiding it from my mother who I had moved back in with and eating what she cooked in addition to add to my charade. I drank a lot of X to numb my pain and anxiety from school, hiding my identity, and my body that was starting to fall apart. I was an angry person and the only thing that made me feel better was food. After I graduated law school, I couldn't find a job. My ED and depression simply got worse. A therapist put me on anti-depressants, which made me want to eat more. This went on for almost two years. I finally found a job and came out to my family with who I was, which helped my depression considerably. Yet, I was still battling my ED, that I still hadn't acknowledged as an ED. Symbolically, on January 1, 2019, I decided to do something about my body that truly was well on its way to falling apart. My back, hips, and knees ached. I had developed a heart condition. I stepped on the scale for the first time in 5 years. I am a female. When I was a pro athlete, I weighed X lbs. On that day, I weighed X lbs. with a dangerous BMI X. I went for a run. I could barely finish X minutes. I had been a pro athlete, and now I was out of breath. This was it, I was done with the way I had been living. I started running every day, X minutes at first. Between January 2019 and July 2020, I lost X lbs. and got up to running X days a week for more than X. More importantly, I admitted to myself I had an eating disorder. I drastically changed my eating habits. After going a year and a half with this new outlook, I really thought I was pretty much cured. I felt good and free. In early July, I relocated to a new country for a job. I started to slip off my strict regime. I stopped running every day and started running maybe X days a week and for less time. More worryingly, I started to feel the compulsion to eat again like I had. I binged for the first time in 18 months. I felt incredibly guilty after, but have done it probably X times over the last month. I stopped measuring out what I was eating. I know I've gained weight, but not sure how much since I don't have a scale.. I'm still running, but the eating is worrying me. I realize that maybe my plan I was on for the last 18 months wasn't exactly sustainable, but I need balance of some kind that lets me eat healthily without binging and without putting on weight. Anyways, this lapse has made me way more anxious and angry than I have been and everything feels lost. I feel like I'm back at square one,, though I know that's not possible. I'm terrified of going back to that. I'm having the compulsion to eat still and it's driving me insane. If any of you have had a similar experience and/or have any resources or tips to help me get a grip on how to get back to my disciplined recovery and figure out balance.

317,yoyokay,08/04/2020,Facing side effects of ED,"I have been on the fence of recovery for a while now, not actively trying to lose weight anymore, but still afraid to gain it. Eating a lot more calories than I was when I was restricting severely, but it still isn't enough to gain weight.

Anyway, I am feeling physically and mentally terrible, dealing with the consequences of my eating disorder. I still don't know how to fully convince myself to jump all the way into recovery. I am just so scared of gaining any fat mass because I hated how I looked before my ED. I know that I am not healthy and I am even scared that I might die if I don't get a hold of this.

320,Joemama,08/01/2020,Tips and advice please ,"Hello, I’ve been with an Ed for 8 months now. How do I get to recovery? I honestly feel like I shouldn’t have all the problems I’m dealing and I should just suck it up. But at the same time I don’t want to lose anymore weight. I have a disease where I need to take medication daily and have to eat for it to work, and not eating will be very bad for my health and I’m scared. But I’m also so terrified of seeking help. I don’t know how to do it. Right now it’s hard for me to type all this. I’ve asked my mom (she doesn’t know about this) about a therapist and she said sure but I don’t know if I can do it. For the past week I’ve been going back and forth on wether I should try it or not. Also, any tips on trying to recover on your own? The past week I’ve been trying to gain a little bit of weight this week. If I did not have this disease I’d keep going to get skinnier. I’ve been trying so hard to eat more but I can’t. I’m just so scared of going out of control and get back to the weight I started this with. I can’t eat what I used to and I desperately need it.

323,msnobody,06/25/2020,"Binge Eating, Food Addiction, Looking For Support","Hello, forgive me if this topic has been shared or discussed.  I am new and didn't find an option to search for previous topics.  I have been suffering from binge eating/food addiction for about 3-5 that I have recognized I needed help but probably longer before I realized what was going on.  I am food obsessed and will eat until I become almost sick.  I was able to get it under control for about a year, I got healthy, got to a healthy weight in a healthy way and then something happened where “I fell off the wagon”.  My trigger is fast food, it’s all I think about until I get it, I eat it until I can’t and then I sit around waiting until I no longer feel full and make another trip to another drive threw.  When I had stopped I felt like food no longer controlled me and it was the greatest feeling I had felt in a very long time.  I want to feel that way again but don’t know how to get back to that spot and more importantly once I get there I don't know how to stay that way.  I was seeing a therapist for about a year but made little progress specifically on binge eating.  I can no longer afford to see someone professionally for help.  I feel like if I had more support, something more like addiction help with people I could reach out to when I get the urge to or begin to binge, people that understood me that could help a lot.I am interested in meeting others with binge eating disorders and interested to hear about their received help or how they are working towards recovery.  I would love to hear any kind of information about what brought you to binge eating to maybe try to find some insight into myself (though I realize everyone is different).

Instead the driver thought he was KOOL or Someting?!?! He went into his Left turn lane, only to head Right like a upside down 5 pattern, into my car which was turning left at the arrow. Anyhow, my car stopped on a DIME, saving both my classic Japanese car and myself. I am Not driving round the hood to profit from the next upcoming car collision. I love my old car parents handed down to me after my own car exploded as I was driving up the entryway to Jack London Square parking garage around 1995 or so. This felt like a REPEAT of another car trauma... I Have been struggling to eat later in the day. I Haven't had a period until the car near miss Drama....Then I suffered cramping and light spotting. Beginning 4 months ago I was supposed to be in early Menopause, according to my female Dr and she hasn't seen me since the Covid-19 began.... Is this what being Labile feels like???? I Haven't been sleeping most nights either. Exercise routine has increased, as appetite has decreased. I feel like I'm Controlling something which I am able to Control. Just got Hired at a new retail Job as well. Now working hours end 1.5 hrs later than my clothing store job at the mall, which I was placed on a FT Furlough and had to Shelter in Place until this New Job came along to get me back into the swing of working again. Feeling Anxious as I am learning new transactions at work, new rules about ages which are allowed to purchase specific products. Other job Never even made me think twice over sales like this new Rule at New Job. Am feeling like am Extra Self Conscious over my body's lack of tone compared to a few yrs ago. I need to swim and Can't until things return to Normal and Indoor Exercise becomes a Lifestyle instead of A New Thing of The Past..... I feel Horrible being Controlled and Life feel like a type of ""LaLa Land"" to me. I see some interesting types of jobs where i could work for huge social connection agency in The Big City in 1 of the Newest and Tallest Buildings I have ever seen. I am terrified of commuting on Public Transit currently as I haven't since a few yrs ago. Bart would stop just few blocks away from this agency, but now cant seem to set up an Interview Time( An Apple-like NY, An Interview, A Job Interview, that is..4Me). I wish this could ALL work out 4 me. In the mean time my eating pattern is out of whack, sleeping is barely happening 4 me at night after work.. Binging is occurring while I am Not even aware that I am Eating then feeling Extra Nervous about finding the Time to work out. The bladder's on Maximum overdrive as is the Anxiety Induced Insomnia. And so i feel Bloated and Somewhat Spirited Away too... I have lost weight in ALL of this Nervousness too. and that ALL seems paradoxical, as The Appetite is currently Insatiable, sleep is Off, and Nerves are feeling like a bunch of my dry split ends of the hair on my head... Anyone else's life disrupted by Covid-19 and feeling transitional stress over not Having a Current Work Schedule and Nothing to do as if we were enjoying The Summer Vacation which was Meant to Bee.

326,butterflygirl27,07/16/2020,so sick of feeling like this,"I’ve been going through short periods of having ed-centered thoughts and minor behaviors since I was 12 (5 years ago), but they always ended fairly quickly and only came back maybe once a year for a few weeks. But this time it’s worse. I’ve been losing weight since January and what started as healthy weight loss (eating healthy, working out frequently, building muscle, and eating in a slight deficit) turned into an obsession in March. It slowly got worse. I’ve reached all my goal weighs (I kept making them lower and lower) and now have a BMI of X but now I’m more obsessed than ever and all I think about all day everyday is losing weight. I count all my calories in and out and punish myself when I don’t and get anxious because I’m so upset that I didn’t meet my goals. If I overeat or am craving something I need to make up for it. I always go to sleep with a growling stomach but I never let myself eat anything since it’ll mess with my calorie count. I exercise as a way to give myself permission to eat and though I don’t binge I feel like I have no control over my eating and I have to do this exercise to compensate in order to lose more weight. Lately, I’ve been feeling anxious if I don’t exercise everyday and I exercise an average of X hours a day. I’ve attempted to purge after eating over my calorie allowance (I couldn’t so I exercised instead) and have tried other things a few  times but I really don’t like it and don’t really plan on doing it again. Recently I’ve just been feeling so much worse. I just feel mentally drained and sad all the time. I feel in control and out of control at the same time. I’ve also been feeling some minor physical effects which are new. I’m exhausted all the time and have been getting dizzy sometimes when I stand up. I’ve also been bruising more easily and sometimes my leg muscles just feel exhausted from all the exercise. It hasn’t even been very long (only like 4 months) but I am so tired of feeling this way. That in itself makes me feel weak because I know lots of other people have been struggling for years with much worse symptoms and I can’t even take this. I’m also scared to reach out for help because I feel so invalid and like my disorder isn’t real since in my mind it’s not super bad. I feel like I want recovery from a disease that I don’t even have.

327,disordered_sprout,07/16/2020,Want to recover,"So, I've been thinking about how the last few months have gone, and it's made me think pretty seriously about my ED. Ever since quarantine, it's all been downhill. I'm either binging (and sometimes purging) or restricting, and quite frankly, I'm sick of it. It's been three years, and I want to properly enjoy food again. For the longest time, I considered putting off recovery until I was eighteen and out of the house (my mom is.... less than supportive), or until I'm sicker, etc. But now I'm worried that by then, it'll be too late.So! Here's where I run into some problems. It's not as simple as ""Just eat"", because whenever I attempt to eat like a normal person, I feel out of control, and go into this whatever mode and binge. My ED behaviors make me feel superior, in a messed up way, and I don't want to lose that because I feel like it's all I have. Plus, I'm not sure where to start, or how to broach the subject with my parents. As I said, my mom is not very supportive and acts like I'm choosing to have an eating disorder. I had to stop seeing my therapist because we couldn't afford it, and I haven't seen my nutritionist since February because of corona. And if it turns out that I need residential, I'm not sure if my parents will be able to afford it. Anybody got any advice?

330,notaneatingdisorder,07/15/2020,I Keep Losing Weight,"Genuinely asking for help here. I’ve always struggled with fluctuations in weight, and the really huge changes usually happen during huge life upheavals (which I know is not abnormal in the slightest). I gained a lot of weight in my first year of college because I was finally able to eat what I wanted without criticism, which unfortunately resulted in me feeding my sugar addiction and binge eating insane amounts of food. I ran out of food money very quickly my first semester and had to change that habit very quickly. I wasn’t able to drop back to a lower weight until my last year of college. Now I have been out of school for a year. I have finally decided what I want to do, am volunteering at an organization where I am doing fulfilling work, looking for a paying position, getting huge offers that I can’t take, and moving into a house with two of my good friends yet in an inaccessible area. Needless to say, I’ve been very stressed, and it doesn’t help that I have been regressing back into maladaptive coping strategies and mindsets after a year of being in a house with my emotionally abusive father. I first noticed my weight beginning to drop precipitously in March, but I just attributed that to stress about COVID-19 and monitored my symptoms (I may have had it at some point, not sure). At the beginning of the year, I was not exactly healthy but was at a lower weight. I had been healthfully and sustainably working out and eating decently in my last year of college, but that all stopped when I moved back home. Just to be clear, I have not been working out and do not have a history of obsessively working out. Quite the opposite, actually - I am frequently depressed, haven’t been on birth control in over a year which is making my PMDD mood swings AWFUL, may have ADHD which messes up my ability to make and stick to schedules, and my anxiety cripples all of that more. I also have hypersomnolence, which is essentially excessive daytime sleepiness. All of these things have compounded to cause me to stay in bed for much longer than I want. I sometimes only eat if I have had time to go to the grocery store in the prior week to get snacks to keep next to my bed, and when I downstairs for dinner. This also means that I don’t always take the medication I do have on time (not related to eating).I have lost a lot of weight in less than five months. It’s gotten to the point where I can actually feel the physical effects this is having on me. I do not have the option to stop working, get back into exercising, or to eat the way I want (though I certainly can eat better). I live with my parents, who had always commented on my weight when I was larger, but only my mother shows concern about how little I eat, and even then she has not mentioned my weight loss. My dad has complimented my body more frequently now than he ever has (which is creepy as hell either way). I have never experienced something this severe related to eating before. I’m not even putting everything I’m experiencing down, and this is already really long. I am used to depression-type symptoms that line up with these, but I have not actually had any episodes in the last couple of months unrelated to my period. I’ve actually had an amazing beginning to the month, work-wise. I am experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety, and I know many of these symptoms are related to my anxiety, but I am very concerned about my well-being. This weight loss does correlate with my discovery that I have PTSD, but I do not think it can be entirely attributed to that. I do NOT want to bring this up to my family. My best friend has made some comments lately that make me want to get help, but I can’t get a doctor now when I’m moving across the state next month. What do I do? None of these hotlines seem helpful, since I don’t think I can exactly attribute this to an eating disorder when it’s symptomatic to other things. I don’t think I’m ugly, I like eating food, I don’t obsess about my weight (in the sense that I think I need to be a certain weight), and though this weight loss has definitely come with me feeling more confident about my body. I experience only very very little body dysmorphia, and some of that honestly has to do with my changing eyesight. I honestly believe that, other than my eating habits, I have a healthy relationship with food. I do not feel resentful towards it, I don’t obsess about “bad foods” or want to go on a restrictive diet, and I have a good understanding of what makes up a balanced, sustainable, healthy diet. I want to be fit and healthy. None of the resources out there I can find that are online and/or deaf-friendly really seem to cater to disordered eating in particular and especially not to non-food obsessive disorderliness. Does anyone have a nutrition plan I can follow to slowly work myself back up to eating more than one meal a day and binging on junk food? Sometimes I forget that I even have it there and don’t eat or drink (hello, ADHD). Should I get tested for COVID? I don’t think I have it, but should I? I definitely plan on getting back into my workouts when I move out, but eating and meal-planning has always been a struggle with me because people verbally criticize and badger me about my eating habits. Not all of it is mean-spirited, but it stops me from learning about what my body wants me to eat. Exercising is also not going to have a great effect on me if I can’t give myself energy through proper food & am working with a weakened body. Any advice? I’m kinda sensitive to some things & have some sensory hang-ups but I am not allergic to any foodstuffs.Please direct me somewhere or give me non-judgmental advice. I just mainly need a meal plan & can’t afford a nutritionist, from which my dad stopped me from even trying to see when I was in high school.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/15/2020-2:09pm",Support,"Hi notaneatingdisorder, welcome to the forums!

332,yoyokay,07/07/2020,How to accept weight gain after working so hard to lose it in the first place?,"I have worked so hard to lose weight and though I honestly look very thin, I enjoy being skinny. I have disliked my body for so long (my whole life). When I finally committed to actually putting in the effort to lose weight, I worked so hard. Choosing recovery in the form of weight gain seems like all of that hard work, a lot of time exercising and denying my hunger was for nothing. I have had constant anxiety and dislike of my body, embarrassment of being photographed, and never wanting to be in social situations. I hate these thoughts because they make me feel like such a bad person. I would never think this way of anyone else and have always been really body positive… except when it comes to myself.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/08/2020-4:20pm",Editing Note,"Hi, yoyokay!

334,nangels,07/01/2020,I hate myself for doing this,"Hi, I’m Natalia, I just had a huge relapse and I found this forum, and I’m gonna tell you my story.
Two year ago I was overweight (not so much) and the only thing that was always on my mind was that I was fat, but also I had a huge aperture and I was thinking of food 24/7. I was so depressed and I didn’t like the way I look. Then I started to take some birth control pill and that just control my appetite I don’t know why, but food wasn’t one of my priorities, I just ate whenever I feel hungry and stop whenever I felt satisfied and my weight was lower, I was happy, I didn’t exercise but I felt good. With this pandemic I must stayed home and I started to exercise a lot and I was happy cause I was seeing so good results, I was getting toned but now I’m in a huge binge eating problem and I have bulimia my weight is even lower although I’m feeling not good about it, I’m always thinking in food, my appetite is insane, I’m counting calories all the time and I’m not happy. I just had a relapse and I can’t stop eating until I feel physically ill and not able to put more food into my body, I feel horrible, I have no control over myself and I just purge and the worst thing is that the only thing that makes me feel even worse is that I’m not purging enough, I would want to be able to vomit more, I know, I’m disgusting but I just want to stop this cycle, and be in my old times when I didn’t care about food, now is the only thing that matters which makes me feel miserable.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/01/2020-1:18pm",Welcome,"Dear Nangels, welcome to the forums!

335,libra.04,07/03/2020,a few questions about a possible ed:,"hello everyone!! i’m pretty new to this, but basically for the last couple months, my mental relationship with food has been pretty bad. i have gotten preoccupied with calorie counting, am self conscious eating in front of others, and i’m scared of gaining weight. i don’t think i have an eating disorder, because i still eat a normal/healthy amount of food, so i feel like it doesn’t count?? i haven’t told anyone about this, because i’m scared they’ll invalidate it, but i also don’t want to accidentally “promote” my habits to anyone. my friends don’t know i’m struggling, so they often make triggering comments about food, and are always reading nutrition labels, etc which makes it worse and just makes the voices in my head louder. i guess i’m just feeling lost and confused, and want to recover except i don’t even know if i have an ed? so i feel like i don’t “deserve” to get better since it never got bad in the first place? anyway, sorry for the long post, but any advice would be really appreciated! thanks soooo much<3",_admin_moderator,"Fri,07/03/2020-2:32pm",Dear libra.04,"We are sorry to hear you are struggling and are concerned for your health and wellbeing.

336,Chlolouh,06/28/2020,I don’t think there is help for me ,"Hi so I’ll start off I’m a 24 year old single mum.I think my eating disorder began in high school. Usual wanting to be skinny as the other girls, not eating because I was saving lunch money for the weekend, then snacking on junk at night times. Looking back at pictures of those days I WAS skinny. I’ve always naturally been a size X when I had my son and went onto the hormonal implant I gained weight, but I lost it, I didn’t “diet” but I hit the gyms. Now I’m not overly bothered about my weight no more than any other person I mean we’d all like to change something right? My problem is just my overall attitude with food. Since my teens till now so around 10 years, I physically cannot finish whatever I am eating, I always have to leave something. I cannot eat socially ESPECIALLY at buffet type functions I feel all eyes are on me!? I just can’t do it! Even family bbqs I’ll keep myself busy so no one notices I’m not actually eating. Now I’m becoming more aware I can go days and days on end without eating. And when I do it’s always very minimal and that will be that for a few days the thought of finishing it makes me feel physically sick. So it’s not me consciously doing it, it’s subconscious.
I landed in hospital earlier this year with collapsing but I was threatened with social services if I didn’t get my diet back on track. Now I have tried the whole small and often etc tried food diaries they just don’t work. So I’m wondering if I do call the GP can they actually help? It’s like I want to beat these mental barriers I have but I really don’t see how I will be able to do that? Like it’s became so normal to be hungry to be weak that this is how I’m going to be forever there’s no turning back to a healthy relationship.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,06/28/2020-11:03pm",Edited your post,"Hi Chlolouh – welcome to the forums.

338,orangescrunchy,06/22/2020,Am I okay?,"Hi
I've been showing some symptoms of an ed recently and I was hoping for advice.
I count my calories everyday and if I go over my limit I work the extra calories off. I eat an unhealthily low amount of calories. I feel bad when I have a big meal, and if I know I'm going to be in a situation where I eat a lot (like a party) I don't eat a lot before hand. I weigh myself and have a 'perfect' weight in mind. I feel scared and sad when my weight goes up and happy when it goes down. I workout multiple times a day.
But somethings I do make it seem like I don't have one; I would never and have never purged, I don't feel uncomfortable about the size of my body, I don't wear baggy clothing, I don't fast, I can eat around other people, I have a healthy weight, I can eat junk food...
I'm wondering if I have a potential ed or just an unhealthy relationship with food...
I don't really know who else to ask, I don't want to tell my family or friends. I did the screening test but I want some more advice please, thanks.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,06/22/2020-9:56pm",Welcome!,"Hi OrangeScrunchy - welcome to the forums. Your post had to be edited to comply with our Community Guidelines: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/forums/community-guidelines.

I even lost my period and this had going on for a few months. Now that I have realized what I was doing I have tried to creating complete meals for myself to eat but in the past three days I have just grabbed everything I could eat in my kitchen and just ate everything without even thinking. I did this for three days so far and the first two days it  was to the point of uncomfortableness and the third day was just enough to keep me full. I'm scared that I am starting to binge on everything but I can't tell if it's just because my body hasn't been getting enough to eat. I'm still scared about what I'm eating but I don't want to be.

343,untiedshoes,05/30/2020,I thought I had a problem but... did I make it up? Or do I actually have BED?,"So..
I’ve struggled with body image for a long as I can possibly remember.  There were little things I’d do to try and eat less or lose weight since I was 11 or 12 and those behaviours definitely increased significantly over time. The first time I purged I was 17, but I always just thought it was me being dramatic or a cool trick or a phase.
After leaving an abusive relationship and getting sober and moving to a new city I started making a bunch of rules to prevent myself from gaining weight - not even to lose, just not to gain.  Slowly I cut entire food groups out one by one.  I stopped taking medications because I thought they might make me gain weight (the medication is for Ulcerative Colitis so also part of me wouldn’t mind the symptoms as I lost a lot of weight from that when it was active..) I also stopped taking vitamins because I was afraid they’d impact my weight.
Then the binges started. And I hated myself.  I’d purge for hours.  When I didn’t feel like that was enough I’d take a lot of laxatives. And then I’d go back to restricting telling myself not to binge ever again, avoid food at all costs except X.My weight was technically pretty low according to the scale, but no one ever really said anything and I didn’t think I looked much different than when I started “editing” my diet to begin with.My health declined -I couldn’t think or speak straight, could barely muster up the strength to walk across the room, I was dizzy and my vision would black out and my heart felt like there were butterflies trapped inside of it.
Then my body turned on me and I just kept binging until I decided I couldn’t do it anymore, I had to try and start eating again to avoid the binges. At first it was working but now... I’m just constantly hungry. And I feel out of control. And confused and scared... did I make it all up? Is it actually BED that I need to address? It’s been two weeks and I’m still so hungry all the time, even when I’m full sometimes I just can’t stop myself. I have an appointment with a nutritionist in a couple weeks but until then... I really don’t want to go back to purging. Wtf is happening hahaha HELP",_admin_moderator,"Sun,05/31/2020-11:12pm",Edited your post ,"Hi untiedshoes.

The diagnosis alone has not made the situation more challenging, but the ""stay home, stay safe"" order has. The result has been a maelstrom of emotional and verbal abuse that is wearing me down and depressing me. I am doing some reading on the topic and trying to take steps to protect myself from it, but it is immensely challenging. I can honestly say that it is making recovery more difficult than it already is.

353,FireflyGhost,05/12/2020,My First Time,"I am not quite sure how to start this, as I’ve never actually put into words what I’m going through. What I have gone through since I was in junior high, close to 15 years ago. It scares me to even share these words with an online group of anonymous strangers, but I figured I had to start somewhere, and this seems like a good place to do that.
I am bulimic, and I have been for the majority of my life.
I still remember the first few times I made myself purge after I ate too many after school snacks. I was afraid of all the new weight my body was gaining once I hit puberty. I was always the skinniest girl I knew, but then I started to get hips and my butt was getting “chunky,” and I was afraid of the way my thighs grew closer together. I ate a box of snacks I found in the kitchen and then purged it.
Now I am 27 years old. I just got home from a food run and I am filled with shame and fear. I am scared that my whole life will be absorbed by this demon. Food is all I think about. I wake up thinking about the hunger, the fear of that hunger, and the shame from the hunger I fed the day before. I am either obsessing about food, bingeing, or purging. Then I just wait to start the cycle over again. I feel isolated, too ashamed to even seek help. I am a master’s prepared nurse, I should know better than to let the very thing that is meant to keep us healthy and strong destroy me. I spent all night googling treatment options, but I am currently still more afraid of being exposed as a bulimic than I am of suffering through this hell for the rest of my life. It has already taken my adolescence, my college years, my early 20s. I used to binge and purge out of hunger and fear of gaining weight, but over the years it has evolved. I am an emotional eater, and will eat to the point of physical pain when I am stressed, sad, or just plain bored of sitting with my own thoughts any longer. Then I purge to release the discomfort, and the fear of hating my body.
So here I am, putting these words out into the universe for the first time. I know this will not cure me, but it’s time I start somewhere. I admire all of you for being so brave. You are stronger than you even know, because you have gotten further in this journey than I have in the past decade and a half. I don’t really know what I am expecting from this. Maybe to feel less alone in my disorder, to feel a sense of unity, or possibly some wisdom from survivors. All I know is I need a change.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,05/12/2020-4:02pm",Dear FireflyGhost,"Welcome to the forums, we are happy to have you here!

354,marmi26,05/16/2020,Realizing there’s a problem,"So I’ve been suffering from disorganized eating for years, since I was 8 years old. Most of it stems from childhood depression that i still carry with me. I was getting overweight this past winter, and i am typically a very athletic person. I enjoy working out and eating fairly clean when i can, but when i go unchecked i tend to control everything from my intake to multiple workouts for hours, to even controlling others diets and workouts. I try to never let it get to the point to where im controlling others habits anymore but it has happened multiple times before. I know this is a problem and i usually just work on it by myself and get back to a place eventually where i can somewhat eat normally but then i feel guilt. Eventually I start thinking that i am overweight again and then the cycle begins again. Since Ive obviously been pushing down the issues and not actually working on them, i think its time to ask for help. Last night was really what made me realize. I binge ate so much crap, my younger brother was hanging out in the living room and he noticed i was gonna throw up so he helped me. He held my hair, brought me water, even took me to bed after. For reference, I am 21 (soon to be 22) and he is 12. I should not be having a child take care of me like that, its unfair and irresponsible. So i need to work on actually recovering.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,05/17/2020-11:50pm",marmi26,"Hi marmi26 – welcome to the forums. We hope they can be of help to you.

355,Seekingchange28,05/27/2020,Not sure what to do,"Hi,
I haven’t been struggling with an eating disorder as long as some people on here. So maybe some of you guys can help me to stop it before it fully consumes me. It sorta has already which is why I’m here. I have been suffering with bulimia for about 8 months now. It started after a significant relationship in my life ended and I think other stressors in my life fully surfaced. At the time when this happened I was actually cutting weight because I am a fitness enthusiast. But with the stress I began to look at my body as not good enough and instead of sticking to the healthy eating that I had accomplished I began to focus more on the scale and I also missed eating “unhealthy” foods. It began small with me eating something I wasn’t technically supposed to and then I would make myself purge so it “didn’t count”. It progressed as the months passed and now I eat so much until I feel like I am going to throw up just sitting there. I did not think it was going to last this long and I told myself I would stop but I was only fooling myself until the next day when I would do it all over again. Honestly, I do this almost every day. Sometimes even twice a day. I hate myself so much for it and no one knows I suffer from this because everyone thinks I am the most confident person. And I used to be which is the sad part. Now I just hate myself. Anytime I eat something I feel bad about it.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,05/28/2020-2:40pm",Dear Seekingchange28,"Welcome to the forums and thank you for sharing your story.

357,sam21,05/25/2020,confused/need help,"So i'm new to all of this and just really confused and need help.  I've never thought of myself of having an eating disorder, i've just always been obsessed with everything i eat and working out and trying to be happy with my body.  Basically, after we went into quarantine I had all this time at home so I started working out as much as i could since i had so much time.  I was working out pretty close to all day, basically as much as my family would let me yet i was eating way way less than normally, trying to lose weight while stuck at home.  I ended up losing weight pretty quickly even though i've been at a technically low-healthy weight to begin with.  My family and people started commenting i started looking to skinny but i still felt disgusting when i looked in the mirror.  A couple weeks ago i started experiencing chronic constipation and basically can't go to the bathroom without some type of laxative now.  i didn't go for 8 days and felt extremely bloated, gross and sick.  I've always eaten super healthy and had a healthy digestive system if you know what i mean so i've never experienced this before.  After trying just about everything possible  I gave up on eating healthy and just ate all of the things i've been holding back on.  Basically I ended up gaining all the weight i had lost back super quickly and felt disgusted with myself so for the past week now i've been eating as little calories as i can possible manage.  I still can't go to the bathroom and now i'm eating so little i feel like i could pass out anytime i stand up but i still am forcing myself to work out.  I am so terrified of gaining weight again but every time i eat, even the tiniest snack possible kills my stomach and i just feel like i'm in this never ending cycle. I've read a lot online that anorexia can cause chronic constipation and i'm wondering if that is it since the only changes i've made have been excessively working out and eating a lot less.

358,Mochi7500,05/24/2020,Purging more,"hi,
ever since quarantine i feel like i cannot get a grip on my eating. I wake up every day thinking about food and at night I go to bed forcing myself not to go downstairs and eat. Im also purging way more now. Before all of this i was only purging once in a while, probably one to two times a week, now I feel like I cannot go a day without purging something. I feel like i must have messed up my digestion system or something because I cant eat without feeling  extremely bloated which just makes the desire to purge go up. My CBT therapist told me she was going to try to look into more intensive treatment for me, but she cant find any due to everything going on. i cant find any sort of balance and im scared of how bad its getting. I cant tell my parents because my mom doesnt think eating disorders are real and she will just shame me for it instead of helping. She doesnt mean to but she just doesnt get it. I feel really stuck and scared. Any advice is welcome.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,05/24/2020-11:26pm",Mochi7500,"Hi Mochi7500 – welcome to the forums.

359,amandanicole1996,05/15/2020,First Step,"They say the first step to fixing a problem is realizing that there is one. I have always struggled with my self image. As a child I was always eating X calorie snack packs rather than the tasty lunches that my friends would eat at the lunch table, and bringing salads rather than a sandwich. While in college I let myself go father than I ever had and I struggled to maintain a weight that I was comfortable with. From binge eating to not eating much at all, I went through all of it. I have tried every diet and fad diet under the sun hoping to lose weight. After trying every fad diet possible I joined another diet where I found ""success"" and lost X pounds. I tracked my food and felt like I was doing something good for myself. After graduating I found myself struggling with my self image again and I have been stuck in this same hole for the past two years. Even though I am at at a healthy weight I just look at myself and know that it is not as perfect as my mind wants it to be. I am ashamed to even admit this. I can't get away from the scale and even a small change will make me not want to enjoy with my family. I decided to start working out every morning as a way to hopefully boost weight loss and it has got to a point where I don't even enjoy working out. The number on the scale is my biggest fear and I am looking for suggests on how to get away from that. I can't get myself to stop. Any suggestions will help, I just want to be able to feel comfortable in my own skin and enjoy life without being afraid of a number and my self image.",_admin_moderator,"Sat,05/16/2020-8:51am",Dear amandanicole1996,"Welcome to the forums!

360,hearthurt,05/16/2020,Food is my relationship,"I'm a relatively good looking and sociable X lb woman who began overeating when my mom died (I was fifteen.) I slowly put on weight until 20 years later I weighed Y, at which time my boyfriend of 14 years left me for a thinner, younger woman right as we had decided to have kids (which did not happen.) Sorrow and grief initiated a large weight loss in about 2-3 months; I was barely eating and running 5 miles a day. I slowly recovered and found a desk job with a long commute, and began gaining weight back. I was diagnosed with Bipolar II two years ago, and over the past six years have gained the weight back and more. I eat huge amounts of calories all in one sitting at night after barely eating during the day. I am lonely as heck, but have not been able to pursue any romantic relationships due to extreme body shame. I feel like my moms death, lack of support from my family afterwards, and the trauma of losing my partner to someone thinner have combined to make this huge hole in my heart, which I can only fill with food. I know recovering from this is going to be a mental health journey and not just a behavioral one - I am wondering if anyone here has experienced this sort of thing after suffering abandonment or death of a parent?Wishing you all love and support as we get through this thing together <3",_admin_moderator,"Sun,05/17/2020-11:53pm",Edited your post,"Hi hearthurt.

361,khanhp,05/14/2020,Trigger foods,"For the past three days I’ve been overeating and trying to purge. I haven’t eaten this food in so long, it always tastes so good with the first few bites, but the more bites I take the more addicting it gets. And when I start feeling sick, the taste and the feeling of having the food in my mouth gravitated me towards having another bite. Until it doesn’t even taste good to me anymore, but I keep on eating it because I want to experience that feeling when I first ate it. But then I was disgusted with myself. Disgusted for even letting such disgusting empty calories reach into my body. Even more disgusted for it to destroy me all over again. And so I purge. And during those moments I would tell myself that I’d never it or any other sweets like this again. I’m so done destroying myself. Every time I purge I promise myself it was gonna be the last time. But the last time doesn’t seem to exist because I can’t control myself around this type of food. But the first thing i think of when I wake up is food rather than exercise. disgusting. It disgusts me. I disgust me. I hate myself. I hate my body. I hate it. I’m trying to get stronger but I don’t know how to start. I know weightlifting is good but I’ve never weight lifted before and I don’t know how to start. I hate this world. I feel so alone even though every way I turn I see my family members.

362,2Healthy4me,05/18/2020,I'm Still @ a Loss for Eating after a Simple Breakfast.,"My daily breakfast has 0 drama to it. I feel like i am eating just to survive this darn Shelter in Place/ Work Fur low. Its become like a personal contest for myself. I have breakfast, plus my ritual cup of coffee which is always after breakfast daily.
Then I go all day feeling like I should be out working at my mall job, and my primary job as a sub. Time goes by very slowly. From the time i have breakfast in the morning I am cursed with belly distension after breakfast.
My belly feels like im totally satiated and need no more food until my & PM dinner. I am having trouble fitting into my curvy skinny jeans which I just purchased a few months ago.
I feel like not working has totally slowed my metabolism.
I was so happy to find jeans my size and on sale. So I stocked up on oodles of black and blue jeans. My only problem now is that I have almost no energy to even go shopping for food. I dread wearing a Covid Mask so i am just avoiding the grocery store for now.
I hate feeling lazy but just cant muster up enough energy to even eat lunch or moderate sized dinner at night. I drag myself to walk at night b4 dinner. However my walk seems miserable. I walk and walk and then my feet have muscle pains as well as my neck and back.
I have increased my muscle relaxants so the pain is manageable but still irritating. Still no period for the last 4 months too. I seriously HOPE it Never returns. Periods have always freaked me out. Its like being afraid of your own shadow.
I am not happy if I am doing all this to avoid feeling guilty about Not fitting comfortably into my blue jeans. And dread walking at night but gee nothing else is there as an outlet for exercising and I just feel so blocked and slowed down and controlled by something I have never ever had to experience before this darn Covid 19.
I haven't seen a therapist in awhile but my plan doesn't help much with specialist co-pays so I only do telephone appts w/ my shrink about every 3-4 months. Happy to say most my former rx's am not on anymore. I am officially off The Pill, off all asthma inhalers, off sleeping aids, off eye lubricant, off sports inhaler, oh well, I wheeze sometimes but usually only if my neck is out of alignment or seasonal allergies kick in.
I feel free about never having to feel guilty for being careless or cavalier about skipping my pills, which had to be taken exactly every friggen morning w/in 1 hr or risk a delay in period cycles.
Going off major asthma rx and female hormones has helped me. I just feel so much better not on any major chemicals flowing through my body. I can’t wait to get into the lap pool and swim my heart out. I hope the swim center re-opens soon.
Sorry, i must sound like a Rambling Rose.

364,NikkiRayy,05/16/2020,Food is Nauseating ,"Hi, I'm new to all this. I don't think I have an eating disorder but I feel like I'm on the edge of having one. I just wanted someplace to vent my fears and problems with eating. I hope to see a professional within the next few months to see how bad this actually is. I don't mind if this isn't read by someone. I just need a safe outlet to journal this for the first time. I've always been a picky eater, usually eating bland foods and no sauces or condiments. I've always been underweight. I don't have a body image issue.
My issue lies with food itself. It's usually fine for the most part, I'll find things I can eat. But for the past month, I can hardly eat anything. The thought of food itself makes me gag. And it worries me that if I try to eat, I might throw up. The feeling is so intense now that I cry from thinking about eating. I'm worried about my weight dropping again because I'm already underweight. But I feel like I'm heading there because eating these days is SO incredibly unpleasant, I'd rather starve the whole day than eat something. Which is what I've been doing lately. And I know it's unhealthy, I can feel the affects on my body, like dizziness and headaches. Hunger pains are hard but go away eventually. It seems worth it in the moment to feel lightheaded and sluggish than eating and possibly throwing up on an empty stomach. I don't even know if I will actually throw up if I force myself to eat when I don't want to. But the fear is so great, I just can't get myself to try. I end up crying instead. And wait another couple hours before thinking about trying it again but then cry again when I think about it. And do not eat.I've been smoking weed at least once a day because being high is the only time it seems when food isn't repulsive. So this helps me eat at least once a day. But I don't want to always rely on this to eat, or become very dependent on it. Which is why I want to seek professional help soon. I gather this new large repulsion of food is due to my anxiety becoming worse (something I also want to seek professional help for). But knowing they're connected still doesn't help me want to eat. It's so frustrating when your body defies your mind. I know I need this to survive. And thankfully, my depression is much more manageable so that I WANT to survive. But it's so hard to fight against the nauseating repulsion I feel towards food. I'm not sure what it is about it that makes me nauseous..the taste? Texture? Both probably. The idea of putting food into my mouth on my tongue and swallowing it, having it slide down my throat into my stomach makes me gag. It was horrible just writing that sentence. Tl;dr
I just want to eat like a normal person. Or at least eat more regularly like I used to. I've never been great with food or eating, but I've definitely been better. I've never struggled like this so much, with such a nauseating repulsion to food it makes me cry and starve. And it's hard to find support. People either eat too much and fear gaining weight, or they don't eat because they fear weight gain. I however would love to gain weight to be healthier. I just can't do what I need to get there. And it feels like an unpopular issue because it doesn't have to do with my body image. I just...can't eat.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,05/17/2020-11:48pm",Edited your post,"Hi NikkiRayy.

365,jenny2,05/12/2020,i need help,"Hi, I have never written on something like this before. I'm not sure if I will get any responses but at this point i feel like i have no choice but to try. Im 18 years old. I have had body image issues for a long time but was always too distracted with college and sports to ever really focus on it. As i started living at school and comparing myself to my teammates and other people, I noticed i started to become obsessed with small things like looking in the mirror and weighing myself. I found so much pleasure in ""morning skinny"" and not being bloated that I decided to change my calories and workouts and have started some other ED habits. My moms birthday was the other day and they wanted to get take out and I about had a panic attack trying to track down the lowest calorie item on the menu. At first I lost a lot of weight and my goal was achieved of having a consistent ""morning skinny"" but i find it to fluctuate. Some weeks i'll look really thin but other weeks i will bloat and I wont know why. it frustrates me and it only encourages me to eat even less. I don't want to stop either because I fear going to a healthier calorie per day lifestyle and eating more than I do will result in me gaining weight. My mind feels so messed up from this and I feel like its going to last forever because i know my metabolism is so messed up that if i ever do try to eat a healthy amount of food, I will gain weight. I guess i just wish i was like the skinny girls with a fast metabolism that don't have to worry about eating and gaining weight. My parents don't believe in these things because they have a mindset that if you have a roof over your head, you should be happy. I just don't know what to do and am too scared to seek help. I feel like i'm not skinny enough to be taken seriously about my eating disorder. I fear people will think I want attention, I fear everything.

367,runningmama,05/14/2020,Can't get period back!,"I am referring like a champ (I think?), and I can't get my period back.While never been ""anorexic,"" I have a history of athletic amenorrhea, red-s, HA, whatever. I was a runner in my twenties and had period problems with pretty low mileage. After seeing fertility specialists, everyone decided I probably had the syndromes above based on flat hormones and progesterone test failure. This was initially shocking to me since I had never been a restrictor, but labs and symptoms didn't lie. I went ""all in"" as they say, got a period 6 weeks later, got pregnant, lost the baby around 10 weeks and relapsed pretty hard. I ended up adopting a child and eventually got my period back once again before successfully doing IVF. Then obviously once I got pregnant, no period.\.Post-partum, I didn't exercise and was heavier but didn't see a period. Eventually, we did another (and last) IVF, which failed. We had decided that was the end, so I picked up my old hobby, hoping I could train enough to make a career out of it. I was so dead-set on not dealing with the period problem ever again and avoiding injury that I hit the calories pretty hard so that I could continue. All the apps and even eating disorder guidelines are way below where I am. At about double what my old mileage used to be, I got a period (albeit a short one). That was 2 months ago, and I haven't seen one since.I'm still hitting the calories hard and often am uncomfortably full. I have been trying a lot of things to lessen that - looking at a food I make and asking, ""how can I make this more nutrient and energy dense? , and adding back in food that I nixed for what I thought were ethical reasons, but detangling all that crap is pretty tough. I am at a weight where I have menstruated regularly. I am taking breaks from running here and there. I feel pretty confident a calorie deficit is remarkably still the problem even with the volume I am eating. Shortly after that first period, I got night sweats and panicked since I am aware that is a sign of low estrogen. I got up and had some food- I really don't feel like I'm restricting. Then my hair started to fall out. So I hit energy-dense foods even harder so that I could fit more calories in my stomach. This seems to have helped in a rather short period of time. I am aware that I am very active and it would be easier if I just chilled. However, I am looking to make this my career and do not want to sit out another year. It really seems like I am eating waaaaay more than other women running higher mileage than me who I know are menstrating. I am not underweight, low end-of-normal. Any suggestions?",_admin_moderator,"Fri,05/15/2020-4:08pm","Dear runningmama, we would","Dear runningmama, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove some language that could be triggering to other users.

370,beingbrave,05/11/2020,Confronted ,"So, this is incredibly hard for me to pen, and I'm not quite sure what I'm looking for with it in terms of response, but I feel so alone right now and so scared.I am 17 years old, and I've had an ED since I was 6. I've been in treatment of some sort consistently since I was 12. I've never recovered. Not fully. I've had periods of relative peace with my ED, but I've never seen it fully leave me.I got out of another stint in residential treatment in October, and insurance kicked me out of PHP in November. After that, I was with an ED specialist and a dietician for a few months, until March when I transitioned to one therapist for my trauma because my ED was stable, and two is quite expensive. With COVID and everything going on, I've fallen back into my old behaviours and it's been really bad. For me and my parents. My mood has gone down, I've become aggressive and sometimes cruel, which is incredibly out of character for me, and of course, I've been physically sicker.My mom confronted me, hence the title, today and was brutally honest with me. She said that my dad has given up on me and that this is my last chance. I told her, and I meant it, that I was scared, and that I wanted to really try to recover fully this time, and that I hate lying to them about this. I really do. I keep lying to them about behaviours and motivation and effort and I hate it so much. I want nothing more than to just be hugged and told that it's okay and that they see me and why I'm doing this and that they love me anyway. However, why would they hug someone who lies to them? Who betrays them? They tell me that constant gaslighting and manipulation is a sure-fire way to get them to hate me, and I still do it and I don't know why.I'm scared I'll lose my family. I'm scared I'll lose my life. I'm scared that I'm not scared of this illness.I've been with my disorder, Bulimia, so long, and it's so hard to turn away from it.After we had that conversation, she sent me to make a list. A list of my long term goals and what I wanted to accomplish. I made it, along with a tearful video for my personal video diary collection, but then I ruined it all. She and my dad went out to go do something for twenty minutes, and I binged, and then of course, I purged. She smelled it when she came home, and she was so angry with me. Justifiably so. She said that she shouldn't have trusted me, she should have known I was lying about wanting recovery, and that she should have never believed I would try. I feel so hurt and lost right now. I've pushed away my entire support system again, and I feel like I'm hopeless. I feel like there's no chance of me getting better, or even repairing my familial bonds. I've said it before, but it's true. I'm scared I've ruined everything.This is the first time I've posted here, and I'm not sure if you guys can help, or even if anyone will read this. But it's worth a shot. I don't have any other options right now.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,05/11/2020-8:28pm",Welcome.,"Hi, beingbrave. Welcome to the forums.

374,iwanttolive,05/03/2020,pAlgEgAb,"Hi.  I am glad you were helped by what I shared.  As I said, I have had to be inpatient too many times but I am in recovery now with a few slips with overeating that try to derail me but I get up and dust myself off and keep going.  My journey back to health was only possible because of my faith in Jesus and His love and care of me.  For me.  I would not be alive if it weren't for Him and for so long I didn't want to live.  I think that is in part why it was so difficult to let go of the eating disorder.  But as per my user name..iwanttolive, God has totally changed that for me.  I was afraid to face just another week let alone a year or a lifetime.  But everything is different in that regard.  I do want to live.  I want to share what Jesus did for me and His love for others and to offer Hope that recovery is possible.  I am finally really living instead of existing.So as far as you go...do you know if you will be going to inpatient and have you told your parents?  If not, maybe writing a letter about what you want to tell them and then either have them read it with you or just having written it it may give you a better idea of what you need to let them know.  Just know I do hope you do what you need to do to get stable.  If you have any questions, please ask and I will try to answer anything I can.

375,h0pe123,05/07/2020,A full 180,"<p>Hi all - Three years ago, I was struggling with anorexic behaviors and obsessive exercise. This was covered up by being “healthy”. The weight loss was is intoxicating. I was getting noticed by guys people were saying things it was an incredible high I was constantly chasing. However, at the time, I thought my exercise and how I was eating was going to last me forever. I had did it. I had finally lost the weight I was being noticed I was someone entirely new. But that someone was losing a mental war with herself everyday. Three years later, I am more depressed than I have ever been. I graduated college in 2018, and moved back home with a mentally ill mother. My commute is awful, and every time I have tried to move out in the last 2 years it never worked out. I’m stuck and I’m lonely. I had my friends ripped away, my social life tanked, and I got to watch my friends move out, date, and start their lives. During these last two years, I’ve been struggling with depression worse than I ever have. I work 10 hours a day, with a three hour round trip commute. I had no energy, I am exhausted, and overall I was gaining weight as office temptations were stronger than I am. I let my depression get the best of me? Who is ever going to see me? I don’t go out I’m to exhausted and I snap at all my friends and my mom. I’m lost. In that first year the weight came on quickly. My movement drastically dropped. Over the last year I’ve realized I’ve done a full 180. My old life was not sustainable but neither is my new one. Today, for example, iI ate too much in one sitting. The emotions and the guilt are overwhelming. I need to break out of this mental prison. I feel embarassed by the weight I’m afraid to post pictures of myself for the people that haven’t seen me since I was lighter. I don’t know what to do anymore the eating is out of control. I never felt less energized. I’m constantly unsatisfied. I’ve lost interest in running which I did actually learn to enjoy.

376,milou,05/07/2020,"Indifference, apathy, how do I find motivation?","Hey everyone, I'm posting for the first time here, after a few years of peeking around forums/blogs like this one. I'm not a native speaker, so please forgive me any slips in advance, and sorry for the length...I'm 27 yo and have been suffering from bulimia for 8 1/2 years now, going through various degrees of severity. Since the onset of the illness I've received, almost continuously, psychotherapy (psychodynamic talk therapy) and have been recently put on meds too. Because a series of losses the last two years have been quite harsh and I've not been able anymore to perceive my problem as something I definitely had to get rid of. Eventually it became my security blanket, my ""anxiolytic medication"", my coping strategy for any and every moment of stress, angst or loss of hope. I ended up accepting it, whereas before I had been able to see it (and hate it) as the cruel, destructive demon inside myself, that I had, HAD to defeat, in order to preserve everything that gave meaning to my life. In order to ""get myself back"". But the things and the people I used to get that very meaning from, the things and the people that made me feel necessary and good at something in this world, are gone now and now I just can't find that meaning inside me alone. I only identify with this illness and with my failed attempts to become the person who, after so many years, got over it.I don't care about anything really, about myself, about recovery, about my future. I'm indifferent towards my life, I don't see the point of making those incredibly intense efforts I would have to make in order to reject once for all the bulimia mentality and all my bulimic behaviors. The very idea of my future utterly scares me like a blank space I won't ever be able to fill with interesting and rich experiences or with loving people. I feel like I only have my current present, dominated by bulimia, frustration and a complete lack of motivation towards being anything else but a self-complaining, quite inert individual. I feel very guilty towards my friends, my family and my therapist for not taking part to their interest for me and for my recovery. I'm still not giving in completely, of course, but I'm doing as little effort as possible to keep the bulimia at bay. I can feel some parts of me ""rationally wanting"" my recovery and a different life, believing it's possible, and bright, and much better than I can even imagine. But I don't deeply ""feel"" these beliefs. I can't put them at the center of a daily strategy to motivate me to act differently, think differently and work towards recovery. I know I should, but I don't really feel I want to, not anymore, not right now. I only know what I ""should"" do, but I can't find a single reason in the world to actually go and do it. It feels like I take comfort in failing and not stand back up and, as said, I feel the guilt of it. I know this all sounds harsh, but I'm trying to give you the authentic picture. Hence my question: how did you find what motivates you strongly enough to really take a stand against your illness and strive for a more peaceful, satisfying life? What makes you go on, everyday, when your darkest feelings fill up your mind and the only thing in the world you would like to do is plunging in more disordered behaviors as the only way to make it through another day? How do you overcome with our sense of guilt when you find yourself indulging in your ED and/or in hopelessness and self-contempt?Any (respectful) suggestions or comments would be very welcome. Thank you so much. And please let us all remember that after all we can be loved, even by ourself.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,05/07/2020-3:08pm",Dear Milo,Welcome to the forums!

377,panayioliv,05/04/2020,"kinda general, but i feel alone","hi. this is my first time on the forum, and i just need a bit of reassurance i guess. ever since quarantine started, my restrictive habits have been getting worse. yesterday i learned i've lost a significant amount of weight in two weeks, yet i don't see any difference, which led to me staring at myself and measuring myself for hours in front of my mirror yesterday. it's a constant cycle of thinking i've seen progress for a few hours, to then thinking i look disgusting and need to be back in control.
also, i just got off the phone with my boyfriend. apparently i've become really distant, even though i don't mean to. he also said that every time i try to make myself better it always ends in self destructive behavior, as if i don't want help. there are times where my mind tells me i don't need help, that i'm perfectly fine. but as i reflect on it it's obviously not true. i just can't get professional help, due to my parents not understanding what i'm going through.

380,MrFahrenheit46,05/03/2020,Trying to recover but it's really really hard,"Hi I'm new here. What I have is mainly bulimia and orthorexia  but I've had anorexia in the past. It started last summer when I went to a sleepaway camp out of state. There was way less adult supervision than what I'm used to (at home it's considered suspicious of me to lock the bathroom door). My mom packed a ton of snack food because I have sensory issues that makes me really picky and she wanted to make sure I'd always have something ""safe"" to eat. But after a few days I started going nuts and bingeing and eventually taught myself to purge. I purged every time we had a gathering (so like every day) because I could shut myself in the disabled bathroom and nobody would miss me. I eventually threw out the snacks and started restricting and overexercising like crazy. The counselor in charge of my hall told me to be careful a few times (I was running laps in the hot sun) and some of the kids I hung out with asked if I was sure I wasn't hungry. But other than that nobody noticed anything was going on. There was a twisted sense of pride because I was getting away with so many things I never wouldve been able to do at home. I managed to get back into relatively normal eating habits by the time I went home again.This winter I got into the keto diet and it really helped. I was able to avoid the high carb foods and didn't get a single urge to b/p or restrict. But now because of the pandemic it's harder to buy keto friendly food. I'm getting the urge to purge even when I eat keto approved stuff. Somehow I havent got caught purging yet but Im stressed out all the time and its taking over again. Christ I had a panic attack over eating crackers.

I think part of it is that I'll have to give it up and actually try to recover and I don't want that.

382,pauline96,04/30/2020,Stuck with guilt and calorie counting,"Hello. I’m new here but I’m struggling with it for so long that I just felt like sharing and hopefully hearing some advice from anybody who already overcame this kind of struggles.
I was never sure if I can even call myself anorexic. I never starved myself to the extent of fasting or anything like that... but I had a set calorie limit. Literally the lowest possible for me if I were lying down and doing nothing. I eventually went below that. And it stayed like that for 3 years. Eventually losing weight but still not feeling thin enough. For now I’m still underweight, everybody around me wishing I'd gain some weight...
But I always just felt bad when I ate anything over that magic calorie limit. Even if I’d walk a bunch that day, it was always the same set amount.
At times when I didn’t exercise, I looked horrible. I had no energy, my symptoms worsened but I still didn’t feel like eating more. I spent one year in Japan with all those restrictions and I lost so many opportunities to try amazing food there just because I was scared. I was scared to eat anything more even though I was walking on daily basis. And I couldn’t stop counting calories.
My body was starving though. Extreme hunger would kick in from time to time and I couldn’t control it at all. It kept on happening once in a few weeks, reminding me that I’m not eating enough.
In hopes of starting to eat more, I started to exercise and take vitamins. But I didn’t really start eating more. I’d exercise every single day. I’d never skip those and I eventually started feeling guilty if I didn’t exercise enough.
There were even weeks when I’d increase calories a little. I promised doctors to eat more... but then I just stop out of fear that I will gain weight. I wish I could stop counting but first of all... I wish I knew how much I can eat. Right now I’m obviously forced to stay at home more but before I’d walk a lot, I'd exercise… and yet, I still don’t feel allowed to eat more than that magic calorie limit that kept on being the rule every single day for 3 years. I don’t know how to overcome that, I really don’t trust myself that I can eat more. And if I can… how do I know how much more food can I have? Extreme hunger made me completely confused and every single time after it disappears, I'm back to feeling like ""the less I eat, the better."" I'm so stuck...",_admin_moderator,"Thu,04/30/2020-2:30pm",Dear pauline96,"Welcome to the forums! We hope you find this to be a supportive place.

383,Dressagequeen,04/28/2020,I’m pretty sure they use Atypical anorexia as a form of torture in hell.,"My eating disorder started when I was 15 after a sexual trauma as a means to control something that was happening to me. I struggled with anorexia in its typical form until 5 years ago. I’m a professional horse trainer, and I like working with special needs horses. One of my more explosive horses had a moment, and bronced for 2 minutes straight before I could get him to stop. Unfortunately the act of staying on pulled every muscle in my body and I couldn’t leave my bed or move for three days (i legit had to use a wheely chair to go to the bathroom) and then I had to be in intensive PT for six months. So after over a decade of forcing my body to acclimate to the metabolism of a sea turtle in an athletes body when I wasn’t moving as much as usual, I put on weight fast. Once I was able to start working out again I panicked hard and cut down calories while working out excessively and kept gaining more weight. I Only recently started seeing a new nutritionist who specializes with ED who told me I had atypical anorexia which I had never knew was a thing. And it is a cruel twisted joke. The less I eat the more I gain weight. I was stressed out one day last fall and did not eat much and I gained weight that day. So now I am trying to force myself to eat- we set a goal, but after so many years of starving myself I have no appetite.  It’s like in the Pirates of the Caribbean movie where the food  turns to ash in his mouth. Does anyone out there have any tricks of how to get yourself to eat? Its so frustrating I just feel super lost.... sorry to be a bummer :(",_admin_moderator,"Wed,04/29/2020-6:23pm","Hi Dressagequeen, We edited","Hi Dressagequeen, We edited your post to remove mentions of specific numbers in reference to weight or calories, because it can be triggering to other users and violates our community guidelines.

384,dont.call.me.jess,04/25/2020,am i ok? ,"I've spent years trying to ""fix myself"" and ""heal myself"" with the thought that once I stopped my bulimic behaviors, I no longer had an eating disorder. False. I stopped all of the purging and fasting and binging almost 10 years ago and only just recently am I realizing that I'm not recovered at all. My thoughts became distorted from the very beginning (if they weren't already) and now I'm realizing what problems they have caused. My ideas and thoughts regarding confidence and body image and food and health & well being and literally everything about myself are so far from where they should be. I need professional help for that, that's for sure. I don't dare tell anyone this and in fact, the only person that knows about anything of this is my ex. It's nice to know that I'm not alone and people really do understand and get it. I like that I have a place to talk about it and get help and not feel anymore shame and embarrassment and guilt than I already do. I've been through some real garbage, ""how did I make it out alive"" situations in my short time on earth and the only thing that has been my constant is my faith. I've never had suicidal thoughts or ideations because I just have this belief that God has a greater plan. I know that I need help and I want to get help and start recovering from this but what do I do and where do I begin and how many people do I really need to tell about this? It's entering the unknown and not knowing what to expect or what's next. I really need a support system and some sort of professional help and my guilt and shame keep me from telling anyone in my family or friend circle. Help, am I going to be ok?

386,alwaysthinking,04/27/2020,Already??,"I really did not want to go ""downhill"" this soon, after inpatient, and when you think about it, this is exactly why it's suggested that you do a proper step-down, afterwards.  Except in my case, it's not an option.  I go from inpatient to one hour a week, once a week, with my absolutely wonderful e.d. therapist.  But it's like telling someone that they have to start at the bottom of Mount Everest and jump to the very top in one giant leap. It's not enough. And my therapist knows this and that's why she keeps trying to find me someone who can see me more often. But it's just not available. No one takes my insurance. And no PHP program does either And no residential does either. And so I just keep plummeting to the same blasted mind frame, and I keep feeling like my world is going to go completely to pieces around me. Granted, I have not given into any behaviors since I got out. But I sure did get close today. And when I looked at the Warnings on the label of a new Med that I have to start, it said that diarrhea is a possibility, for up to three months after stopping it.  I only take it for 10 days. But I remember the last time I was on it, and it definitely causes diarrhea for a long time. And that good old eating disorder voice is thrilled to pieces with it. Because I have felt so uncomfortable in my body today. Anytime I ate, I felt like I was bloated and I just wanted to exercise to the extremes to get rid of it. And I just feel like I am back where I started. I'm so frustrated. And I'm so tired of this. And yet it's not really surprising, because I really did not go to an inpatient for eating disorders. I went to a psych Hospital that simply monitored my eating.  That's not what I signed up for and that's not what I thought I was going into. They did not help me in the slightest. But I intend to keep fighting. I have my own PHP set up to do on my own tomorrow. If nothing's available for me, then I do it myself. With Jehovah's help as always.

389,2Healthy4me,04/23/2020,Corona is Inducing a Loss of Self Discipline and .......(A ReallyLong Vent),"followed by a few days of refusing food and fluid intake? Lately after I have even a small meal, my stomach has been distending out w/in minutes of having just eaten a simple meal.
Then I became so flustered that I wanted to see what happened if I had a full fledged food binge on all the foods I rarely allow my body to experience. I usually am a Control Freak over my body.
I even end up experiencing weekly vacations from Disciplined Eating and find myself on a loose supporting futon and shoving food into my orifice. I make a game out of my binge too.
Then I feel ashamed of having just made a muck of my totally disciplined body. Then I resort to using ED behaviors.
Then feel bad when my country is Now enforcing the rule that mouth must be covered if planning to exercise outdoors, if we must. Well I must, or my body is soon going to become out of control and my worst enemy.
I am experiencing bad cramps even b4 Im done binging. I still dont stop. I usually don't stop until something real walks in the front door, like my housemate.....Ughhhhh?
I recently went cold turkey off of my female hormones at my OB-Gyn's request. Not sure why but I'm supposed to drop a bunch of weight after going off The Pill.
I'm still waiting for that miracle to occur. In the mean time I'm sabotaging my body with this out of control binging.
I do believe that the binging is related to being on a mandatory vacation from my 2 careers. No more eating within a controlled break and meal time. All the time in the whirled to open up and begin sabotaging my body.
Why am I doing this. I need to stay within my size range as I am also a size model for my company. I'm totally going to lose my job as a fit model whenever I need to weigh in and have measurements taken for my next fitting.
I'm feeling like my body is splitting in 2 totally different directions. The direction of total control and career stability, and the other direction of being totally out of control over my body which feels like is rapidly gaining pounds and curves in places I never had problems with before.
What should I do. I have asthma and it's too challenging to take a walk outside w/ a mask covering my face.......
I just wanna go sleep until this entire PANDEMIC curse ends. I'm at my witts end, really hate feeling cornered, slowed down, and turned into a caged in hamster.
I feel like I'm ultimately becoming too reliant on snacks, in lieu of discipline and exercise, like before

393,WeebleSF,04/17/2020,Medically Induced Anorexia and Severe Fear of Food,"At 37, the confluence of two auto-immune disorders resulted in a year of medically-induced anorexia. I dropped significant weight over several months and landed in the ER.
I'm now managing my conditions but have an abject fear of food. One of my conditions, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), is a relatively new disease and one that indicates severe allergies to food. However, there are no tests that are accurate to identify what you're allergic to and instead you have to take the long arduous journey down an elimination diet.
So, eating disorder meet elimination diet meet abject fear of food that can cause some serious side effects.For the last year EVERYTHING I ate made me sick. It got to the point where even drinking water made me so nauseas. Now, in quarantine, I have a completely controlled environment and control 	what I eat. The issue with this is that I'm truly afraid of food. Now, don't think I'm crazy because logically I know this is nuts, but my body doesn't seem to think so.
How do I desensitize myself to food(s)? I'm still malnourished and am trying to add in new foods for more variety.
I need to eat more. A full stomach makes me feel uncomfortable.  Best suggestions for adding density to meals?
I'm eventually going to need to work on the social aspect of this disease once I'm out of quarantine. How do I even begin approaching food prepared by others?
Lastly, one of the medications I'm on to increase my appetite (I have none) and mitigate the nausea has a nice little side effect - mania. On top of all the nutritional issues I'm having, I run and deal with akathisia.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,04/17/2020-4:21pm",Dear WeebleSF,"We are writing to inform you that we have had to edit your post of triggering content and material that is not permitted on the forums.

396,pAIgEgAb,04/17/2020,lots of questions and a vent...sorry if this is too long,"A couple of days ago my parents confronted me about my eating disorder. I finally admitted to myself and them that I have had anorexia for about a year now. Now I'm starting my recovery but I don't really know what to expect. I feel guilty because I feel that I am not ""sick enough"" or that I do not deserve treatment or was not really that bad. My mother suggested that I go to an inpatient facility but right now with COVID-19 that is difficult and I was afraid of going. I don't know what to expect from an inpatient facility. How do I know if I am ""sick enough"" to receive a certain level of treatment? They agreed to try family based therapy along with a therapist who specializes in eating disorders for a little bit. For the past couple of days they have been monitoring everything I eat. It was SOOO much more than I was used to even through they agreed to slowly increase the amount I was eating. I can't weigh myself anymore and I am so anxious. I try my hardest to wait the longest amount of time possible before I eat. I have been eating the bare minimal amount to satisfy them. Before I eat I get so anxious I start shaking and want to cry but can't. I just feel paralyzed and my brain rapidly searches for ways to escape consuming the food. Every time I eat I get bloated, exhausted, nauseous, dehydration, dizziness, headaches, brain fog, spacing out, +. I don't have many fear foods which is part of why I feel ""not sick"" enough, but lately all foods are so terrifying. Despite all of the physical symptoms I have been feeling, I felt fairly motivated to recover(at least 50-75% motivated to recover). There was the regret of admitting it to them. Maybe if I had continued to deny it, I would still be able to continue my behaviors. A few days into refeeding I got really hungry. I ignored it for some days and then the other night the most obnoxious hunger took over me. It was the most hungry I have ever been in my entire life. I was crying for hours until, in a fit of motivation, I finally decided to eat. I ate in one sitting more than I used to eat in days. This really freaked me out. After, I felt so guilty and so large. All of the behaviors I was trying my best to manage(not completely stop) like looking at my body in the mirror came right back. I looked at myself and though I probably don't look that much different,  it made all of my motivation to recovery go away. I worked out in secret a lot and hid my snacks. The really hungryness(I guess) has come again but I can't bring myself to eat like I did before. I know obviously I am not going to be totally in it during this whole recovery process but I am really freaking out and I can't do this anymore. I want to quit so badly. I haven't started ED therapy yet but this is already SOO much harder than I had anticipated. Part of me wishes I lost more weight and was hospitalized so that recovery was necessary and more forced. Then that would give me the validation that I am sick because it still doesn't feel that way.
I'm sorry this is really long and I am so thankful if you made it this far. I guess long vent short what I really want to know is how do you know how ""sick"" you are?, what can I expect from residential or all-day treatment?, how do I know what will be most effective for me?, what else can I expect from recovery?(i mean like the hunger, is that normal?). My family has been so supportive during this time and I am so thankful of that but I am so terrified of gaining weight and food and I don't know if I can do this or put them through the burden of making me want to recover.

399,barbhel,04/17/2020,accepting my ED,"Hi all,
this is the first time I've ever actively done anything about my ED and I'm so scared. I've never told anyone about it because I'm too ashamed. But the other night I harmed myself and I realised that I really need help. I can't tell anyone i know, i just can't. I'm waiting 5 months so that I can turn 18 and get professional help myself.
Over the 4 years which I've been struggling with my various ED's, Ive always believed that I could get better, that it was just a matter of willpower. Now i think I finally accept that it's a bit harder than that.
I'm really scared, because i don't want to accept that. I don't want to turn my problems into a big deal, because then they are a big deal. I hope you know what I mean.

404,alwaysthinking,04/09/2020,Getting help,"I emailed my eating disorder therapist yesterday. I had asked her that if she had the opportunity and time to give me a call if she could. I told her that there was something I should have told her last week that was of the utmost importance. And lo and behold, after I finished an earnest, supplicating Prayer to Jehovah God, where I was bawling out my eyes as usual, she called. We had about a 10 to 15-minute conversation where I told her everything. It took a lot of strength, which I know came from Jehovah, of course.  But I got through it. And she said she would start calling various inpatient hospitals, if that's what I wanted.  And I had to tell her, that I really had no idea what I really wanted. Because in my eating disorder mind, getting better means getting fat again. And so I was at least able to tell her, that I am not in full capability of my faculties. So I told her to do what she thought was best. And she said she would start making the calls. And one teeny, little itty bitty part of me is glad. The one part that just wants to be serving Jehovah. I hate that it's so tiny right now.  I hate that my Eating Disorder's voice has become so absolutely huge and boomingly loud.  But at least I'm still hearing the one little voice that wants only to be serving Jehovah.  And then there's the lab work that my psychiatrist ordered. I looked at the results today. One part of me is scared. But it really goes along with how I've been feeling today. I've been so lethargic, absolutely freezing, even though my apartment is registering 77 degrees, and bottom line, I am just starving. So all of that made me beg Jehovah to help me have the strength to eat a ""reasonable,"" ""normal"" meal, without recording it and without counting calories. Which I did. And very soon after I was absolutely terrified, mortified, and very soon, I was engaging in yet another e.d. behavior. And when I was, I was feeling very weak, numb, and tingly. I am scared. More than I've ever been before with this entire ordeal. I don't know what to do. So I'm leaving it in Jehovah's capable hands and hoping that and hoping that my therapist is able to find a placement for me soon. And I still don't want to get better. Because of what that means in my eating disorder mind. This whole thing is totally insane.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,04/10/2020-3:30pm",Dear alwaysthinking,We are glad to hear you have contacted your psychiatrist however some of the symptoms you have described are very concerning and we worry about your health and wellbeing.

405,cassismh,04/12/2020,Please help me,"Hi,This is my first time ever doing this ( writing on a forum or even talking to anyone about this issue I struggle with, even my therapist who I have seen for 11 years does't really know I even have an ED).  I am so so so sad.  I struggle so hard with weight every single day of my life for the last 4 years it has consumed my existence.  If the scale is ""good"" then I'm good, but if its bad, anyone around me, which is usually only my mother because I'm too ashamed to go out (especially now with COVID, I live with my other and she is the only person I interact with), then its bad for everyone.  I am so nasty.  I started off with very restrictive eating back in 2016 and was very happy with the weight I got to, but I'm sure some fo you know, once the number keeps going down, you can not bear to see it go back up.  This fall I was at the lowest weight I've ever been since I was about 10 or 11 years old, and I loved it.  In the last 2 weeks I have gained X pounds,  I don't see how it is possible as I have not stopped purging and haven't binged more then typically.  I do think think I'm having a harder time purging then I normally do because I'm so frantic.  I am so lost and sad and I'm so alone I really just need some help.  I don't know what else I can do at this point I'm just so miserable.  All I can think about is thank god I don't have to go into my office right now lol butt I look horrible my face is puffy my stomach is huge and I just want to non stop cry but I also cant stop putting food into my mouth. I am ashamed, and embarrassed.  My family has called me out multiple times in the last few months and my mom has been calling me out unfairly which I honestly think makes it worse (obviously not her fault that the s is happening she just doesn't get it). I hope this forum will help me and I am realy looking forward to your feedback.Hope you area all safe and healthy along with your families,",_admin_moderator,"Mon,04/13/2020-8:05am",Edited your post,"Dear cassismh, welcome to the forums!

408,2Healthy4me,04/04/2020,Measurement 4 Measurement !!!,"With all this time off from my 2 jobs, i have begun to grocery shop. The grocery store that i Discovered actually is spacious, well stocked, and very approachably inviting for a Positive grocery shopping experience. I am someone rather timid about being in stores, malls, dr offices, staff meetings, DMV lines, etc....So I went shopping and 1st went down every aisle i could possibly muster up energy to walk down. I got a Big Picture in my mind of how things were arranged on the store shelves.  Then I realized that the prices at this market were quite competitive compared to other nearby grocery stores. Especially with the,  ""Ding Dang Coronavirus"" on my mind. The spaciousness at this store was an extra plus to me.I stocked up on TP, and PPT's. This reminded me of an earlier time of my life when i had used certain ED aids to purge, quite often, and always needed to keep the household tp stocked up so no one ever saw a pattern of missing tp.OMG, the pressure began building up and I felt so excited to be in a huge store,  Fully jam Packed with ultimate binge foods,  and a few necessary food items i eat on Good Days too. I was tempted to purchase more bad foods than healthy foods. I gave into my food cravings and went home and ate Non Stop.I ate Rather Rapidly,within a brief amount of time, and consumed a lot of Unhealthy Food. After Eating my stomach immediately was Cramping Big Time. I felt woozy and like my heart was beating a bit on the fast side of normalcy for me. I normally have bradycardia, the heart beat rate of a turtle,  in other words...Then i thought back in Retrospect and realized that during my Binge episode, i had also downed quite a few cups or carafes, of house coffee. That too may have induced the feeling of a super fast heart beat. I'm Not sure,    oh well...Today i weighed myself on my house scale and was overwhelmed by the weight I have gained since having NOT worked for the past 2-3 weeks. I went to exercise directly after and in the middle of my workout it began to rain. It was too damn windy to use my umbrella too.I had to QUIT, and turn around and return to my dry, comfort zone of an apartment. I realized after returning home that i hadn't eaten normally since that episode a few days ago.I failed to eat Lunch and Dinner and realized too that i hadn't been using my lunch replacements as i always have at my 2 jobs. I feel really disappointed with my New weight gain, and terrified that my metabolism is all screwed up now from not being The Active lil Career Woman that i have been for the the last few yrs.I feel out of control. I cant even go walk after weighing myself as even the damn weather is controlling me. The other night my brother was listening to Trump's speech for a few hrs. The TV was a bit loud, and i was emotionally tired of this ""Big Speech"". After i took my PM meds my head felt light, and i thought i was gonna pass out. Thank God i did actually get sick to my stomach. After that,  I felt much better. Unfortunately this all happened on the day I went shopping and was a bit too excited, i suppose.I feel like this is ALL another sequel to a mini series. My anxiety and ED seem to have become Reactivated,   once again.(Like another episode of Dynasty...)As my passive, and pathetic life goes on,....Now What? Don't wanna do therapy all over again. I want to try to regain Total Control over this monster of an appetite/food obsession.Must overcome feeling fat, pathetic, and lazy. I am  currently out of work, and now acting out badly w/ an ED relapse. Can't afford individual therapy, to grossed out, and embarrassed feeling to even sit in on an ED support group, and even if i could, the government and CDC is  advising all group events to be cancelled until further notice!Ughhh, what will my next series of this soap, about a Workaholic woman,now experiencing Withdrawal from not Working her 2 jobs,    include next? I know, an ER hospitalization from overeating,  and managing to get a Big chunk of unchewed food caught in my throat?Gee, won't i be that Cat's Meow of the ER ward? No really---i can't go anywhere near a Kaiser building until this CV all blows off,  and i feel safe to go near a hospital, or Dr's office once again...They upped my monthly Cov CA health ins fee so I may be shopping for a different one, or next year,  even try a new plan.The Kaiser online pharmacy is just so convenient that I can't find a new plan just yet. I'm afraid I am used to things always being convenient for me.I thank God that I have been Blessed with this ability for a ""Comfort Zone"" so my anxiety hasn't gotten too out of control, and induced a  induce a major panik/heart attack so far.Thanks God.....",_admin_moderator,"Mon,04/06/2020-12:00am",Medical Symptoms,"Hi iFast2eat –you mentioned some concerning medical symptoms in your post, for which you may want to speak to a medical provider. The following are just some of the signs of a serious problem that demands immediate medical attention:

409,heythere,04/07/2020,Just curious if anyone else feels this way,"Hey!!
So it's been a while since my last post on here (it was on a other acc) and honestly i havent been very well at all.... What i thought was just binges and restriction kind of turned into purging, which has led me to gain a lot of weight. I have never felt so bad in my entire life, even though this is not the heaviest i have ever been.
Covid 19 is being such a a pain..... For the first 3 weeks of confinement i have been bingeing like crazy ( as i have for the past few months), without purging cause i jus't can't do it if my mom is home, i feel way too bad.
Then this past few days i have returned to my very old habits of highly restricting my calories.... And i kind of feel like it's getting out of control even though it hasn't been that long ??? i know where this ends, with me in complete misery but not looking ''sick'' enough for any kind of recovery. I actually went to a nutritionist who gave a diet kind of even worse than the one i have now ????
I don't even know who i am anymore, i used to be so passionate about my carreer (dance) but i just can't seem to focus... food thoughts take all of my time.
So, I wanted to know if someone ever felt this thing that i have been thinking recently: what if i am just making all of this up?? what if im just looking for a problem, to make myself the victim??? what if this isn't really that important and i just want to be the center of attention??????
I kind of try to let a lot of people know that i struggle (except for my family, that's not happening anytime soon) and i don't know if it is in desperate need of seeking help or if i'm just trying to get their attention ????
I know this probably doesn't make any sense, but i just had to get it out.
I think i may do have a problem, just not the one i want. it sounds terrible, but i feel like i try so hard to be the fragile anorexic girl when in reality im just good at bingeing and restricting... i don't know im sorry",_admin_moderator,"Tue,04/07/2020-3:07pm",Welcome Back,"Dear heythere, Welcome back to the forums!

410,OLLogan,03/21/2020,Struggling with COVID19 and being home alone with food,"I thought I had a handle on my disorders, until recently. I have cycled through anorexia and bulimia in the past and in my adult years, have added binge eating disorder to the list. Having to shelter in place has shone a light on how little I have actually recovered and I am already back to my restrictive behaviors and trying to keep my intake under X calories a day to start (I know that's a lot but it is much less than what I usually consume). I tried purging this week and I couldn't. I tried eating all the ""bad"" foods first because, in a panic, I was terrified that I even thought I was ok to have those in my home. I am just really struggling and feel immense hopelessness right now. I even considered cutting again and it has only been a week like this. I don't understand how I have fallen so quickly.

411,silverstars,04/04/2020,How far i've fallen in a year,"Just about a year ago i ran from treatment.
It was a rash decision.i was scared and angry.
(Anger is always a tough one for me because i was simply not permitted to express anger as a kid.)
Anyway,i really regret it now.In fact i hate myself for it.i had a chance and i messed it up big time.So,the other day i was looking at my binder from the hospital,and a little piece of paper fell out.
It read,""i am doing this for me.""This is the right time."" ""i am worth it."" i am brave."" ""i am proud of myself.""At the suggestion of staff i had written these little affirmations to set on my trays to motivate myself.i forgot all about it.i believe i found it for a reason.i actually did pretty well on my own after leaving the hospital (Although thinking on it now i was still not eating normally) with the support from my pyschiatrist who is also my therapist,but that didn't last long.
i quickly fell deep into the eating disorder,and right now i am struggling so terribly that the person who wrote those words has dissipated.i have finally accepted the fact that i still need treatment in order to recover.i was kidding myself that i could do it on my own.i don't have a meal plan and dieticians here in my province in Canada are not covered by the provincial health plan and are very expensive.i did do a search for dieticians who will work on a sliding scale and i did find one in my city who does,and she also accepts pay what you can.Is there any point in contacting her now when i am certain she is not seeing patients because of the virus? i guess it couldn't hurt.i am i think,i hope,that i am ready to make a change,and i have accepted that i just cannot do this on my own.i simply have no idea HOW to eat.i really don't.i am either eating next to nothing or having massive binges where i hardly even taste the food.Anyway,i suppose there was little point to this post,i'm sorry.i am just so....so desperate right now and needed to write i guess.Thank you for reading if you have.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,04/05/2020-11:56pm",silverstars,"Hi silverstars - you mentioned some worrying feelings, and we want to make sure you know there are resources available.

The past few weeks, due to the fact that I've had to be at home (instead of at college), my ED voice has gotten REALLY loud. I am worried about my family knowing and have been changing how I am eating since being home. Every minute of every day, I am preoccupied with how much I will/won't eat, and it's tough. I am on my college's rugby team, so I am normally pretty active. I have been going on runs since being stuck at home, but on days that I do not run/exercise, I feel so so guilty. Both of these issues (the food and the exercise) are made worse by the fact that I am comparing myself to my sister. I know that nourishing my body and giving it rest are very important. On a logical level, I know that I am not a failure. But I still can't get the negative feelings and body-image issues to go away.

414,franmarzilli8,04/02/2020,Nourishing to Flourish: My story ,"As a young child, I always loved myself. I was fortunate to have friends, a loving family, and a good education. I felt like I had all that I needed in the world and rarely felt sad or insecure. As I grew up and reached middle school, a lot changed. I became exposed to the unrealistic body standards society creates for us. I noticed how everyone valued “thin” over “fat.” But, it wasn’t that simple. You couldn’t be too thin or too fat- you had to be somewhere in between. I hated the way these ideals made me feel. I compared myself to everyone around me, always putting myself down. I desired being thinner and prettier. I felt so uncomfortable in my own body and it was painful. At age 12, a boy I knew called me “fat.” One simple-minded remark destroyed any confidence I had and left me wanting “better” for myself. I wanted to participate in diet culture and to look like one of those models in the magazines. I didn’t know this way of thinking would later transform my whole life. A few years later, I lost a lot of things. I lost a relationship, friends, and hope. I needed to work on a few things. I wanted to be a better person, but I didn’t know how. I began engaging in eating disorder behaviors. I started restricting, denying hunger, and I was actively trying to change the size and shape of my body. Soon enough, I was diagnosed with an eating disorder, anorexia nervosa. I began attending therapy sessions and medical checkups. I became increasingly worse and my doctor told me I would have to attend PHP (partial hospitalization program) to treat my eating disorder. As soon as I started the program I felt better- I was trying new foods and eating more overall. I could physically and mentally feel the progress. However, something happened in the middle of my PHP experience that made things a lot harder. I was sexually abused on the weekend of my birthday and brought to the hospital. From there I was admitted to the psychiatric unit, where I stayed for around a week to deal with my ED and the previous experience. After my stay at unit 6, I went back to PHP and stayed another 3 weeks. I didn’t think I was going to be able to move on after what happened, but it turned out okay. I was eating again and stabilizing my weight and my relationship with food. A few months later I relapsed. I developed an awful binging, purging, and fasting cycle that drained my energy and my spirit. I missed out the pep rally due to low blood pressure and the week after homecoming I was admitted to the medical floor for food refusal. I stayed there for four days where I was forced to eat all day. There, I participated in NG tube feeding to ensure I got all my nutrition in. After my hospital stay, I was admitted back into PHP where I also did tube feeding until it was taken away from me. I was devastated and for what? I lost a tube that went through my nose. That’s when I realized how sick I was. I desperately needed the tube to validate my eating disorder to society around me. I noticed that the life I was living simply wasn’t living. I was motivated to recover and make a change. I was discharged from PHP 6 weeks later and went back to school. I was trying to learn to love my body and to accept the weight gain and changes my body went through. I made new friends and grew closer to my boyfriend. I felt good. Soon my ED thoughts returned and I started purging again. I didn’t think I would ever get out of this. I was so fixated on pleasing my anorexia and bulimia. Nothing was more important to me. I made a choice with my treatment team to attend a residential facility in New York. I am currently there and I can honestly say it was one of the greatest choices. I have learned so much here and made the most progress I ever have. I am learning to love food again because let’s be honest food is good. I will be discharging hopefully in May and I truly believe this will be my last treatment center. I am determined to recover. My body is beautiful and it is the only one I get. I will keep sharing my story and advocating for those who don’t feel like they have a voice.

415,alwaysthinking,03/30/2020,Want to/Don't want to,"I'm really tired of this. One minute I'm really wanting to get help  And beat the stupid eating disorder. And the next minute I'm wanting to give in to it again. I've gone two days with doing 100% of my meal plans. I was able to go  both of those days with being in a really good mood for almost  the entire day. But nearing the end of yesterday, I could tell I was slipping into a really negative mood again. It was because I was reliving a past memory. I'm so tired of the past haunting me. I'm so tired of the past  destroying me. I want so much to live. And yet at the same time, it seems like I'm ready to just give in and give up.  It almost seems like it's desirous to become so sick, that I either  have to be in the hospital because of  my anorexia or even worse, die from it. And I feel traitorous saying it. It feels like I am an awful person just to voice it out loud. Because I'm doing this voice to text on my phone. Makes me feel like I'm not  having enough faith in Jehovah God and that I'm not letting Him  Be there for me. I know I need to talk with my elders about this. And yet they're so busy trying to help the entire congregation  because of everything going on with the recent developments, due to the COVID-19 stuff.  So I feel like I'm not worthy of their time. But then, I never feel worthy of anything anymore. I made a sign yesterday that I put on my treadmill to try to remind me  of why I need to stick to my eating plan and not give in. It says, in order to save the world, ( By doing my Ministry) I have to eat. And then I made another sign that I'm trying to finish, that says the ""real me"" wants to live. And yet, it's so hard to feel this way all the time. And I'm so tired of giving it to this feeling. I'm so tired of these two opposite feelings constantly battling each other. I'm so tired of my life. And yes, I'm bawling the entire time that I am writing this. Because this is such a dilemma and such a constant struggle. I hate this fight. I hate all of this. I want to do what is right and it is so hard. I don't know how to keep fighting. I want to but I don't know how. I ate breakfast today, but I don't know how I'm going to eat any other of my meals. And I'm sure I'm going to exercise like crazy today. I hate this thing.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,03/30/2020-8:20pm",alwaysthinking,"Hi alwaysthinking - your post had to be edited because it contained details about ED behavior that can be triggering to others.

416,Stajo2012,03/30/2020,Regretting admitting that there's a problem,"I have been binge eating for a long time. I have gained weight over the past couple of years due to binge eating.I have finally admitted to having a problem and I feel as if I'm struggling more. There are probably several underlying issues to address as to why I binge eat, but I thought that finally admitting it would help. I finally came clean to my boyfriend of 9 years. I came clean to my mother. I came clean to my doctor. I came clean to my sister. My boyfriend wants to help, but doesn't know how. My mom listens, but offers no support. I think my sister is so wrapped up in her own life that she does not care. My doctor was extra supportive. She recommended a book for me to read. She gave me papers to get a psych consult. And she was the first person to tell me that she was going to help me beat it. She talked at length with me, even though she had other patients to see and for that, I am so grateful.The issue is that now, nobody is accepting new patients. And the service that I reached out to for help on finding where to go with my psych consult has not responded in over a month. We are quarantined. My work is closed for the time being. My anxiety is off the charts. And I am by myself all day, every day. No one checks in.So I binge. I try hard not to, and I am in a constant state of panic over it lately. I want to eat because I'm genuinely hungry. But I don't want to let myself eat, because if I do, I know what it will lead to. But then I give in, because I shouldn't just not eat. But then I binge. I binge until I'm overly full because for some reason, even though I feel sick from how much I ate, I feel comforted. And then I feel bad, angry, sad. And telling my boyfriend has just made me feel worse. I constantly worry on whether he is judging everything that I put into my body. With it being a nice day yesterday, I suggested that we got get dessert and him, thinking that he was helping me to not binge, shot the idea down. Which made me mad, and then hurt, and then embarrassed. He doesn't understand that the binging doesn't happen when he's at home. Of course I don't want him to see that. I sneak snacks when he isn't looking, but the bulk of the binging is before I go to work, in my car. After work, in my car. His solution is that we just don't keep groceries in the house, as if that helps. Like I won't just get in my car and go have a field day and then make sure to toss the evidence at the gas station before I go back home.He is trying to help but I feel worse. I feel like there is constant judgement being masked as concern. We have not been intimate in a couple of years and I know it's due to a lot of weight gain. This is starting to consume me. I can't think of anything other than binging, or trying to not binge, or feeling bad about a binge. The way my body now looks is consuming me. I avoid public functions. I hate going to work because I dwell on how I look. I feel like everyone is constantly judging me. The anxiety and health problems that are coming along with it are terrifying to me. And I am quickly going in the direction that my grandmother and now my father are heading towards...death associated with obesity problems. I need help. I need a friend, which I don't have at this moment. I am alone and lonely and tired and sad and guilty and ashamed.I just want the suffering in silence to end, but I don't want the judgement masked as concern.I'm tired of fighting this.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,03/30/2020-4:13pm","Dear Stajo2012, we would like","Dear Stajo2012, we would like to inform you that we have edited your post to remove weight numbers and mentions of specific food, which could be triggering to other users and are not allowed on the forums.

Ive struggled with a lot of things in the past, self-harming and suicidal thoughts. The centre of those issues I've found is accepting myself. Recently I've gained a lot of weight and I'm not comfortable with it, I've developed stretch marks all over, and I keep on restricting myself and then binging and the cycle continues I'm not sure what to do about it, my weight is not significantly above or below average when it fluctuates, however, my mental health is suffering from being very unhappy with how I look. Because my weight isn't dramatically different from the average person it prevents me from thinking I have an eating disorder however my cycle of eating makes me think I do, does anyone have any advice or tips for recovery?</p>",_admin_moderator,"Mon,03/30/2020-1:10am",Resources,"Hi sarah.jones – welcome to the forums.

Not really healthy for my height but i started taking medication to treat abnormal cells. The medication has so far made me gain X lbs, possibly more as i feel heavier. I am getting bigger and started having pre-diabetes.I dont know if i have an eating disorder. I do know that i sometimes eat until i am uncomfortably full, and need to take deep breaths. I get heart burn from the overeating. I dont even need to be hungry to want food. I dont admit this to many people, but food offers comfort to me. I'm not sure if i have the capacity to change, but i fear getting bigger and bigger. Its hard to get into my car at this point, my body physically hurts. I havent gotten to this size in years.I have been in the cycle of eating healthy for awhile, i lose a bit of weight, and then i start eating more. I have tried eliminating junk food completely and eventually give in. I tried intuitive eating so these foods wouldnt trigger me anymore. I tried so many different diets, and it doesnt get rid of my desire to overeat. Its even harder now with the medication I am on.I am not sure how to fix this.

421,JanetteWhitfield,03/20/2020,Lost,Had a major relapse and trying to recover but completely lost. I only have husband to talk to and he really doesnt get it. He thinks if I get a hobby that will fix things lol. He sees everything as black and white and logic and says he wants to help but I feel like he is hindering and making any attempts I make at recovery worse. I dont know what to eat to recover and struggling with choices. I make all my own food despite me crying out to my husband to just do it for me because I cant make those choices and its driving me crazy. I am convinced he prefers me to be anorexic. Since Ive told him Im struggling it has meant that I can openly not eat instead of hiding it. He thinks I should just get over it. I am sooooo confused and he is trying to rationalise everything but there is nothing rational about this and I just dont know whst’s what! I feel like my head is such a mess. I have 2 teenagers who I am trying to hide it all from and I have no time to fix myself. I cant think straight. I cant concentrate on anything. Writing this is a struggle. I have no time or energy to sort myself out and I dont know whats right and wrong in my thinking. I cant get help so I have to do this alone. All the help out there is for younger people and people who have support but I have to do this on my own.

423,Lifetlks,03/14/2020,Exercise and Food Obsession,"Hi,
I'm not sure really how to start this or what to say, perhaps some context will help. I've been sporty my whole life, since I was 9 I've been in competitive sports and stayed in them till I was 18 when I started getting injured and sick. I'm now 20 and I am really struggling with maintaining a consistent exercise schedule and eating plan.
I try to make up and stick to a consistent training schedule and then end up burning out in less than a week or I'm too sore and tired to do anything. I then fall into a cycle of depression, guilt, and anger because I can't complete a training schedule that I keep on drastically reducing.
Since I havent been able to properly train Ive fallen into a cycle of feeling guilty when I am eating, I then tend to restrict my food and then get so hungry and eat way too much at one time. Its always healthy food and I havent been able to enjoy other foods I have enjoyed before such as 'junk' food in general.
Ive found that Im always trying to maintain exercise in consistency with the national health guidelines however I tend to go too overboard and push myself too hard and not listen to my body.
Currently I am all over the place lately emotionally, my period has been AWOL for 6 months now, my appetite is all over the place, Im underweight for my height and even my parents say I look anorexic in a marathon runner sort of way.
I feel overwhelmed because I want to exercise but exercise and therefore a food obsession has seemed to take over my life and I just dont know what to do.

425,vjdx91,03/11/2020,PLEASE READ-I truly need advice.,"Hello everyone. I really need some advice and possibly another viewpoint of what I'm experiencing. I will begin by saying I grew up having a mom that had anorexia/bulimia. I truly developed my eating disorder in 2010 when I deliberately began starving myself and making it a goal to get thin. I went from X to X lbs. As I progressed through college I was so fixated on my weight. 10 years later (and currently) I am 28 and approx. X lbs. I have gained weight through the years and I do believe a lot has to do with my age; however, I think I've shifted from starving to binging. I have such a problem with binging and doing it randomly at night. It's so frustrating because I eat great during the day. I keep getting random urges to not eat during the day because I want to go back to that control.

426,lifeisjustachac...,03/10/2020,I Don't Know If I Have An ED,"I didn't really know what topic to put this under, but basically, I think I might have an ED and a lot of people are saying I do, but I just don't know if I classify as one. I have really bad anxiety, and when I get stressed out, I find it hard to eat, and last year is when it all started to develop. I had anxiety so bad that I started only eating a full meal like every two or three days or so, and feeling physically unable to eat. I didn't think much of it, because I didn't ever feel hungry or anything, and it was really easy to lie to my parents and friends about eating a late lunch or eating at a friend's house or something, so it worked pretty well for me. however, I started to lose a lot of weight, and my friends started to notice. At that point in time, I was X and by the end of winter, when my anxiety started to calm down, I was at X pounds and my BMI was kinda messed up. once summer started though, I could eat like normal and everything is fine. the only thing that was different, was that my friends know knew that I had trouble eating, but they knew it wasn't an ED and that it was just my anxiety. This year though, it been a little different. I've been eating even less, and for reasons unknown to me, I downloaded a calorie tracker app, which originally started out as a way to make sure I was eating enough, but I don't think it's just that anymore. I'm X now, and last week I weighed X pounds which is pretty good for me, but its been going down so much, that I weighed myself and now I'm at X. I know I'm not as rapidly declining as a lot of people, but it still scares me a lot, especially when some days I only get like X calories in me, and I haven't had more than X in a day in three weeks. I was actually body-shamed last year, which I didn't think affected me, but I've been thinking about it more and more with my anxiety getting worse again, and I think it might actually have impacted me. sometimes I find myself just wishing that I was pretty, or stereotypically pretty, because especially for a female, I really have no shape to my body because of my bone structure, and ill probably never have the waist that I so desperately crave. I think I've been too scared to confront the fact that the reason my eating is so much worse this year is because of my body image up until this point, but one of my exes with an ED has been trying to get me to think about it and some of my friends have as well. I just don't know what to do. I'm getting really scared, because now whenever I try to get, I get super nauseous and think I'm going to vomit, and I get bad headaches as well. the other day, I hadn't eaten for a long time, and I actually passed out while I was getting ready for work and woke up fifteen minutes later on my bedroom floor. not to mention that me not eating, paired with the fact I only get two hours of sleep a night and have a job at a restaurant that I work at for 7 hours at a time as well as school, I don't know if I can function if I keep passing out, but I don't know how to stop eating. also, I really like the way I'm losing weight but I still don't know if that's why I'm not eating.

430,Jessng,03/08/2020,Do I need inpatient??,"Hi everyone- my names Jess I’m new to this forum. So, I’ve struggled on and off with an eating disorder (primarily Bulimia) for a little over 10 years now. I’ve had moments in my life throughout where it’s gotten bad after gaining a whole bunch of weight and then losing a lot over a couple months from primarily purging behaviors. One of these bad times is right now- people are worried and those who knows are concerned. If I’m not binging and purging, I restrict or use substances to help me restrict. I keep tally of how many times I purge to see patterns and it’s been quite a bit. I stopped getting my period last month, my hair falls out more in the shower, I have absolutely no energy physically or mentally, mood swings, have had my parotid an salivary glands become inflamed and swollen, broken blood vessels and I’m sure some unseen issues which scare me. I’ve been in and out of therapy for years and recently started again. I just don’t know where to start or how to stop this. It’s completely taken over so many aspects of my life and I’m high functioning in terms of maintaining a job and social life but it’s been getting SO hard to get to work everyday. I just don’t have it in me anymore to keep fighting this and I’m scared it’ll damage me physically long term or that I’ll never truly recover.

Sure, I have my few moments when I feel decent, and a few times when I feel super, but invariably, it always returns to this same feeling of infinite dread, because nothing I do is ever going to change my past.  I have told my trauma therapist that the flashbacks don't bother me as much, any more, because they're over; in the past; done.  And it's true.  They don't bother me very much at all, now.  What does, however, is realizing that I am a total social moron, who simply cannot ever be ""normal,"" because my parents basically prevented me from ever having any relationship with absolutely anyone, at all, my entire life!  I was their world, essentially.  Or, to put it more accurately, my world was them.  Sure, I was involved in tons of extracurricular activities when in school, but actual relationships, whether with schoolmates or even within my religious organization was basically forbidden.  Even once I was an adult, I still lived with my parents till I was 41, and under their domineering thumbs, I was only to be their friend and do what they wanted, never what I may have desired.  So, being completely brainwashed for 41 years out of my almost 44, now, how am I ever supposed to have a chance of changing the way I was manipulated into thinking for so long?  It formed my brain.  My totally whacked-out Brain that I absolutely can't stand.  How do I have a chance at ever having ""normal"" relationships?  Why bother trying?  I feel totally defeated and utterly hopeless.  I know Jehovah God can and will change all that, when His Son, Jesus Christ begins ruling on earth, after Armageddon.  I know that Paradise will fix all of this.  It's the enduring until then that seems impossible anymore.  It makes eating impossible.

435,Lizzyw,03/02/2020,Recovery,"I’ve started recovery on my own after realizing what this disorder was doing to me. I had no energy, I was cold all the time, my heart rate dropped and I got scared about the consequences. Since I started eating more I already have started to feel so much better but I think my next step is to tell my therapist. Except every week I put it off because I’m scared about what she will say. I don’t know what recovery looks like for someone with atypical anorexia, I’m not underweight nor have I ever been underweight I’m at a healthy weight for my age,height,etc. and I’m very scared she will tell me I have to gain weight to make a full recovery and I don’t know if I’m ready for that. I’m not sure what I want out of posting on this forum. Maybe just posting this and actually admitting to someone else, even through a screen that I’ve been suffering will help me realize that what I’m going through is valid and will help me tell my therapist. It sounds so silly but I’m happy when I see myself in the mirror and I don’t want to lose that by telling someone and being forced into gaining weight.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,03/02/2020-4:00pm","Dear Lizzyw, since you","Dear Lizzyw, since you mentioned dealing with some concerning symptoms, we would like to pass on a list of symptoms to watch out for. The following are just some of the signs of a serious problem that demands immediate medical attention:
