0,B4TM4N,10/25/2021,Unsure if I have a disorder,"My wife is concerned I have an unhealthy relationship with food because I count calories and macros daily. I do have a bit of body dysmorphia because of a lot of things:
When I was a kid I was very skinny as a wrestler, so that did harbor a negative relationship with food at a young age. College freed me from that and I put on a ton of weight rapidly. Then I lost a lot of weight to get healthier about 4 yes after graduation, which focused mostly on avoiding certain foods and exercising. And I was in a stage performance in 2019 where I lost weight to fit a vision, but I had the understanding that I wouldn't ever do that again once the show ended.
Since then I've just been counting to make sure I eat the right amount of food for my size, and keep things balanced. This to me feels like a more generalized idea of eating. I also exercise several times a week. I'm not skipping meals, though I do tend to skip a snack in the day and then binge later at night.Is this obsessive? Or some type of disorder?",_admin_moderator,"Tue,10/26/2021-12:27am",Welcome!,"Hi B4TM4N! Welcome to the forums! Your post has been edited to comply with NEDA’s Community Guidelines.

1,nikos,10/14/2021,AM I BULIMIC?,"It started last year ,while i was 18 years old.I spent a rough year stressing over exams and at the same period i was really afraid not to gain any weight ,because of the limited time i had to workout .My weight was never a real problem .Nevertheless, i started developing in my head this constant fear of gaining weight.So , i balanced my time between reading and working out daily.I also had a pretty strict diet(cutting out certain food groups),which i maintained for 2 months and lost some weight .People started commenting on my beautiful body so i felt really uplifted .Everything felt great and even though i was extremely pressured ,i managed to balance all that and was feeling really healthy.I feel that the real problem started developing the summer after the exams .After all that pressure ,i could finally let loose of myself.So i stopped watching my diet and gradually till august i had gained all the  weight back.I still felt ok with my weight as i knew that other people couldn't really tell the difference.But i started feeling more dissatisfied with myself than ever before.My clothes would't fit me perfectly and my eating habits had gotten back to normal.I was at 0 .And then...quarantine gave me a hard slap on the face.I couldn't play volleyball anymore,which was my passion since forever.I couldn't go to college , took online courses instead.I couldn't see my friends .It was a big change in my life ,it felt like everything was falling apart.I think i spent months being depressed,arguing with my parents,doing nothing productive with my life .They didn't even allow us celebrate christmas with our loved ones.I could literally see my life passing by...I think that's when i started finding confort in food.All i did was binge eating ,watching series all day and feeling bad about myself.   After those months ,coffee shops and gym were finally open again .My decision was to take advantage of my free time and get out of that cycle.So i started working at a coffe shop ,took driving classes,enrolled to the gym etc.I thought it was all over .I thought that keeping myself busy would make my food problem disapear .Instead i was always exhausted from work and started binging even more.I still couldn't realize i had a problem.I spent the whole summer thinking about my body and my weight.Then summer ended..  The now: Now ,a year later, i finally left town to go to a university.I'm still adapting to the new life:new home,new town ,new people ...As one can imagine im pretty stressed.At first ,i really tried eating healthy and maintaining my weight.But now,i find myself binge eating exta amounts of food uncontrolably.I just can't control myself.I consume food till i can't move from the pain .Then i feel awful and weak ,but i always end up doing it again .Im Often so swollen and embarassed to get out .I cancel my plans and sit home all day hurting.I've tried purging.Today i made it for the first time.It was this moment i realized things are serious and im not just simply walk away from something like this .It sickenes my mind even thinking about it .Im desperate,im afraid,i can't control it ,don't know what's hapening and why ...I just want to stop worrying about my weight .Please help.P.S. I have trichotillomania(since i was little),developed severe dermatillomania in puberty and im pretty sure i have a light form of OCD even though im not diagnosed.I 'm also a perfectionist (took me years to realize).",_admin_moderator,"Thu,10/14/2021-2:12pm",Welcome Nikos ,"Welcome to the forums Nikos!

2,kga63,09/30/2021,Do I have an eating disorder?,"Hi guys, this is kinda scary lol.  Anyways I am a 19 year old male, a freshman in college.  I am reaching out because I am scared to talk to people I know in person about this topic.  I have not gone to the doctor about any of my mental health concerns due to fear of my parents overworrying about me which makes me stress out more.  If I say that I have a mental health disorder or imply that I feel like I have it, and I do not but this process offends anybody I sincerely apologize.
I have been struggling with what I feel is anxiety for years now, but it is not to the point where it messes with my functionality so I think i'm fine there.  I started having what i belive to be bipolar episodes in eight grade.  I go through phases where I am extremely depressed, but then something can happen and I will become extremly happy, but I am also more happy than sad so IDK if I qualify as bipolar.  Now with the eating disorder it has been going on since freshman year.  I would change my body to what other people wanted.  During football season I was a lineman and would gain weight to be at my heaviest.  I was 5 foot 5 at the time.  I would do this by stuffing myself full of food.  During baseball season however I would need to lose weight, the lowest I got during baseball was less than my heaviest and I was 5 foot 7.  The way I acheived this was by starving myself for 2-3 days while doing my atheltics.  Then I would gourge myself for a day, feel terrible and start over. I was so proud of the number on the scale, but still hate the way my body looks.  About 3 months ago I stopped starving myself and havent felt like this, but recently I have started hating my body again even though I havent put on any weight and I feel that I am going to fall back into that cycle.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,10/01/2021-2:05pm",Hi Kga63!,"Hi Kga63!

5,HernanZ,07/28/2021,"Food Addiction, Eating too much, gaining weight, binge eating","(Excuse my english grammar).  So 2 years ago I am very obese teen, and then I suddenly want to lose weight cause I’m very ashamed of my body and I have a family history of diabetes & high blood pressure so I try to workout and  and loose some weight to be in a healthy range, In 2 years and of course.  I am very happy that I loss that tremendous amount of weight in my age, to be healthier and so I can wear all my fitted clothes. So the next month I come up  a plan for exercising and eating healthy and also the time I bought a scale thats the start of my scale obsession start and also my eating disorder/problem it started when I watch mukbang videos/cooking shows/food vlogs. At first I said i’m gonna eat only certain foods and because I have money I can buy food whatever I want and how much I want to consume I hide a food from my cousin and to mom in my closet go outside when my mom and cousin are busy, then increase how much I eat, which is very high for my age and it very depressing for me and concerning.  I’m suffering from food addiction,binge eating, eating disorders or some case I have Bulimia for almost a month now. I didn’t go to the doctor and I don’t want to tell my mom cause she doesn’t even care whats happening to me and I don’t have money to go to a dietitian. I was very concerned about my health. I tried to put my money on my moms piggy bank so I cannot use it but I always have an idea to get the money back and change my self I always exercise doing a calorie deficit but my diet only become successful at the first day that I tried it and then the next day I binge my self to fullness. I gained back some weight and also my clothes are starting to shrink I am so very depressed how can I change my life again. I don’t know how long this can last.

7,idkman,05/10/2021,"Male teen that binge eats, but cannot gain weight","To start I am 18, a considerably moderate/healthy weight, lets just say i have a long way before my thigh gap closes.I hate that I over eat, I don't count my food, but I have enough knowledge to know that I'm eating way beyond healthy portions. I typically don't start eating till about 12, but have recently been eating breakfast at school cause I've even started to get hungry then. When I do eat I bring food to go along with school lunch or whatever I've made for the day, (school lunch typically has smaller nutritional values of everything you need to make up for what some kids may not be getting at home)After that I eat a snack.Then for dinner we typically have protein heavy meals, but there are always carb and veggie options. I usually eat about 4 servings of everything at dinner. (like right now I just had a meal, started with a small plate and waited for everyone to eat, then went back for more)At about 1 AM I eat whatever I can find.I eat all this during the week, the weekends are similar but my meal times are much more unplanned and also more of what my body considers a ""snack""I currently do not do much for physical activity, I am in band, I play mallet percussion, and I sleep about 12 hours a day. I honestly have no clue why I cannot gain weight, or why I even eat like this, it's gotten to a point where I'm scared to stop because I may lose weight, or I could develop things like diabetes or other diseases from changing my diet to something my body isn't used to.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,05/11/2021-1:54pm","Dear idkman, we would like to","Dear idkman, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove mentions of height and weight numbers, as welll as mentions of specific food items, since it could be triggering to other users.

8,yorkhaven36,05/16/2020,Not Eating/ Losing Weight,"Hi, my name is Patrick and I am 36 years old. I am reaching out bc I am losing weight regularly and not eating well. I haven’t ate well in about two months. I was losing weight during the winter and my doctor did tests on me. They all came back fine and well. I was healthy. Since March, I have not ate well at all. I consume little during the day and at nighttime and that’s bad. I lose a few pounds a week estimated. I fear swallowing and eating due to an episode back in March when i did choke on some food. I fear if I when I eat now I’ll choke, have heartburn, be bloated, or excessively burp. All of these symptoms are true to a degree. My doctor doesn’t seem to want to help me after a few months ago. My family is unsure how to help me thru this crisis of mine. I’m unsure what to do next. I did reach out to a counselor for help that’s a start. I should call my doctor back but what to say something but what. They will be horrified of how I look. My family is horrified of my appearance as well. My weight loss is the cause. I’m at a crossroads. I care about my health and want to get better. I’m unemployed for the past few months as well. Life has been a challenge a well. It seems to be better to be stuck in old ways and not care. Feel free to message me back with any thoughts or feedback would be appreciated.

9,Antwire,07/08/2020,I can’t stop eating ,"So I’ve always been bigger than I should be but in the last 10 years I’ve gained a significant amount I fascinate about food, I drive past a shop and think “they sell that” then I go and buy it all and eat it all. For example I could easily got to Morrison’s and buy way too much. Then eat it all in the car on the way home and then come home and eat something else. yesterday I did the above and then for lunch a really large meal, followed by a large dinner. I litteraley never feel full and never feel hungry. a few years ago I was lucky and got onto afitness programme the local authority was running which was 12 weeks of boot camps X times per week and lost some weight really enjoyed life. (I was lucky enough to do the programme twice) but then politics got in the way and I didn’t feel welcome there. move tried joining gyms but I got X or X times. I always feel embarrassed. I got into running and ran a few ks but then I hurt my shoulder and I can’t get back going, I always feel embarrassed the minute I see someone else walking. ive been to the GP many times over the years and told them I feel like an alcoholic would but with food, I was referred to a lifestyle programme but it’s one where after a few weeks they don’t want to be seeing you every week. I went back to the GP and was givenn medication but that didn’t work either. I’ve also taken medication on and off over the years with no joy. I joined a different programme for X months and put on weight I paid to go private and see a physiatrist but after 3 appointments all he was getting me to do was fill in food diaries so I didn’t go back. I really don’t know what else to do, I feel like I’ll never beat this and no one will ever understand my problem or be able to help me. I have a young daughter and I’m embarrassed to be out with her, I go on any rides at theme parks with her and it’s horrible. I feel shame, I know I need to do something but I just can’t motivate myself to do anything. Has anyone ever known anyone this stupid and can anyone offer and advice? thank you",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/08/2020-6:29pm",Hi Antwire.Welcome to the,"Hi Antwire.Welcome to the forums!
