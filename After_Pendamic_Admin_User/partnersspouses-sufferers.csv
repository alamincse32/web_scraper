1,blusp,08/28/2021,When to push the panic button?,"Hi Everyone,
I've known my wife for about 20 years and been married for 10. Until February this year she never appeared to have an ED but has since seemingly developed anorexia. I think the trigger was her putting on some weight such that she didn't fit in some old clothes, although she was still within the healthy BMI range. Since then she has plummeted in weight. As far as I can tell she is barely eating and is exercising at least 2 hours a day; likely more due to all her pacing around the house. The positives currently is that she diagnosed herself with a problem and sought help from a professional specialising in eating disorders, which she is seeing in two weeks. She came to me and told me what she was struggling with in about late July.So she seemed on top of things and I tried to support and not interfere but since then her weight keeps dropping. She keeps a log of her weight (which I have read behind her back, I apologise) but it means I know that she is lying to me when I ask how things are going and she says she is recovering and gaining weight whereas I just see the real numbers going down. She is incredibly secretive and doesn't want anyone to know about this which has put me in a difficult position as my parents want to visit but I've had to make excuses since she doesn't want anyone to see how thin she has got. It's difficult hiding all this from my son (9 years old) who I think knows something is up. I hate lying to him so I have to walk a fine line between feeling like I explained things the best I can to him and not causing my wife to become extremely upset. Lately I have become concerned about my wife driving my son places, since I know at her BMI she should could potentially faint - I haven't brought this up with her yet, but I suspect it will cause more upset. In fact, if others can chip on this point explicitly it would help a lot.Each time I raise something of concern she says ""I stress her out which doesn't help her recovery"". Of course I want to help, but I am also growing concerned that there is no recovery and she just wants no one interfering with her ED.I desperately want to respect her wishes and the way she wants to do things. But I'm beginning to feel there must be a point where you hit the panic button where you tell a wider circle of family so they can support and start overriding her; like getting rid of all the exercise machines she has bought. What do I do?Please help.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,08/30/2021-10:57am",blusp,"Hi blusp, welcome to the forums. We’re glad you’re here and are sorry to hear about what’s going on with your wife.

2,Rose63,08/12/2021,Husband is not eating and constantly weighing himself but in denial - ,"Hi all:I'm new here - my husband has quite a bit of weight in a short period of time.  not that he was even that much overweight. but he just kept going and is now obsessed with not eating and weighing himself. He continues to say he's full after eating half a meal.  even says he feels nauseous.  Yesterday he only ate a little bit.  that's it. All day long.   said he wasn't hungry.I have told him I'm worried about his weight and asked him to talk to me about whats going on.  I've said I'm here to talk about anything.  I support him and I love him.  I've told him nothing is too much for me to hear...  But he's in denial.   he doesn't do that cover up thing - he acutally continues to buy smaller clothes and wear small shorts which show his stick legs.  I do not tell him to eat or force him to eat or anything.  We serve ourselves at dinner.  I do try to make things he really really likes though.  I believe he's in total denial - his kids have even mentioned their concerns.  None of us nag but once ina while we might mention it.  People at work have asked if he's OKSo my question for you all is - is there anything I can say to help him see the slippery slope he's on?  that weighing himself 20 times a day shows that he needs help.  I'm even thinking of calling his doctor to have her talk to him.  but that seems invasive.  I just want to help him seek help.  Note, I do know the three Cs - i didn't cause this, I can't control it and I can't cure it.  but perhaps I can help him get help before this gets bad...I'd love your thoughts on how I can support him and how I can help him decide to seek help.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,08/12/2021-2:14pm",Welcome! ,"Hi Rose 63!

3,Johnn-towns,04/20/2021,Worried about my partner ED,"Hello, my partner suffers from a ED I assume. We have been together coming up 9 years and when I first met her she was X stone .. at the age of 17. She struggled putting on weight or eating proper meals and enough food. As the years gone on I promised my self to help her gain weight, now she’s 25 and we have moved out to our own place she has put on weight and now she’s at X stone which she is only Xft so she isn’t very tall. So Iv been so proud of her Anyway her life is hectic, stress with her family mainly her mother suffers from depression and neglect from her father and sister who has things going on and throwing getting comments to my partner about her weight etc. So the only positive things she has is friends and me so I can see where her depression started. So sometimes she has good weeks and some times there really bad but she can not look at her self in the mirror without knocking her self sick. Everyday it’s in her mind that her weight or body isn’t correct for a 24 year own women and sometimes she can’t even leave the house or do things that she would love todo. Some meal times are hard she doesn’t know what she wants or when she eats it’s only something small or she can’t get half way through a normal meal. At times she doesn’t want to eat and it frustrates her because she really wants to but her her mind making her feel sick just looking at her food. When she does have good times it’s eating X which she can have a good amount no problem. I’m just looking for some advice because I’d do anything for this girl. Iv now ordered some weight gainers just to experiment. She will never ever be happy unless her gains weight and it’s been that long Iv tries my hardest to support her but it feels like I’m drowning im running out of options or ideas. There is plenty more to say but I’ll leave it as this for now thank you for any advice",_admin_moderator,"Wed,04/21/2021-5:11pm","Dear Johnn-towns, we would","Dear Johnn-towns, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove weight, heigt numbers as well as specific food items, as these could be triggering to other users.

4,holzi,04/02/2021,Partner relapsing,"First time talking about this to anyone...my partner has said they're struggling bad at the minute and is seeking professional help again (they're good like that).I was a little surprised and hurt that they didn't tell me they were struggling before. I know it's an ongoing thing but I thought their recovery was still going well and am annoyed at myself for not noticing things were getting bad again. Little habits I've noticed have started to creep back in. Like I bought three different types of small canned cocktails for us and they chose the only one which had the caloric content stated. They said it was a comfort thing, to know how much they were consuming. A few years ago when things were really dire, I remember them telling me certain foods affected their periods (and, like an idiot, I bought into it), but really they were just scared of the calories. It was very worryingAnyway, just venting a little I guess. I'm scared things are going to get REALLY bad again, like they were a few years ago when we were trying to date for the first time. The disease consumed them so much they literally didn't have it in them to continue the relationship with me. When we got together properly in the summer of 2020, they promised they were better now and they'd never, ever let themselves get that sick again. I truly believed they meant it when they said they were better but I very quickly discovered that wasn't the case.I'm glad they get help when they need it but they don't believe they'll ever overcome those thoughts and that it's all about ignoring those thoughts, not getting rid of them. I'm just so scared they'll die young. That's my ultimate fear, that even if they do 'recover', all the damage they've done to themselves will ultimately end in a premature death. Their liver is already very damaged and their skin is often yellow, so I know organs have been affected. According to their doctor, they're a 'healthy weight' at the moment, but there's still no periods. They've just started running again and dancing most nights and doing up to 3 hours of yoga. I think it's too much for a recovering body. I'm hoping this is just a setback, not a full blown relapse because I don't believe our relationship will survive it a second time. My anxiety is sky-high and I'm trying so hard not to let it show because they are the most sensitive person in the world and have said so many times they don't ever want to be a burden on me. They aren't, but this disease is. It's affected everything. I'm not the one suffering with it but it's on my mind all day everyday as well. We don't even live together yet, but plan to at the end of this year. This worries me, because they eat well when we're together for the one full day we get a week when we're not at work, but I know they have many secret eating habits that I don't see but will be hard to hide when we live together. I hate that this is something I have to think about. It's like a third member of the relationship, we've even named that part of their brain! I hate it and feel so guilty at the thought that I truly don't know if I would have gotten back with them had I know they were still suffering. I love them so much but I'm not sure my own mental health can cope with this for the rest of our lives.Sorry if that was a lot, it's just a bit tough at the moment.",_admin_moderator,"Sat,04/03/2021-10:20am","Hi holzi, Welcome to the","Hi holzi, Welcome to the forums!

5,Codman123,03/31/2021,Partner/Ex Broke up with me due to an ED and now I’m concerned for their health.,"Hi, I would first like to say that reading just a few of the forum posts has been very helpful as I can relate to every single one I’ve read which is of great comfort to me in my situation. And a special mention to BobJ who has provided some excellent advice to others on the forum.I would like to know if it was possible to talk to BobJ privately about my specific situation. I understand by replying on the forum could be of benefit to others but my partner, current ex, asked me specifically not to talk to anyone about this so I feel posting on an open forum somewhat betrays the trust they have put in me, and in addition they have previously mentioned that they have been seeking help via helplines and forums.

6,986jj,02/26/2021,Pushing Away,"Hi all,I'm a long-time lurker, and first time poster. My girlfriend and I have been together for over two years, and for the past year or so, her ED has been a near-constant in our relationship. After a flare-up in the spring, she opened up to me about everything, and I am the only person in her life who knows the full extent of what she is going through. Her friends are aware that for a little while, something was wrong, but they think she is more-or-less fully recovered. On the other hand, her family refuses to believe that she even has an eating disorder, and frequently make comments about her weight and eating habits.Despite a less-than-ideal living situation, she has made great strides in recent months. Days of intense behaviors are in the rear-view, and now, her eating and exercise habits are much more sustainable and healthy. Things are not perfect - portions are still precisely measured, body image is still a major issue, etc. - but they have gradually improved with the passage of time. So much so that, as of a few weeks ago, she told me she felt the healthiest she has felt in a long time, and that she wanted to try expanding her diet to allow her to regain some of the weight she initially lost.Naturally, I was pumped to hear this. I love her unconditionally, and any decision to lose or gain weight won't affect that in the slightest. But even still, it felt like such an important milestone on her road to recovery. She was hopeful as well, but more than anything she was, understandably, really scared. Fast forward about a week or so. She has a busy stretch at school, and starts to cancel plans. We still saw each other a few times, or at least FaceTimed for a few minutes when things were really stressful. I know how hectic midterm season can be, so this was, in a sense, expected, and totally okay. Within a few days though, reaching her became almost impossible, and any attempts to make plans were being shut down. By the end of the week, we ended up going for a drive. She broke up with me, saying that I deserved more than what she had to offer me, that she wasn't good enough, that she needed to learn how to love herself before she could love someone else.I was caught by surprise, but not totally shocked. We had also taken a break when she was going through the initial rough patch last spring, and the reasons she provided then were more or less identical. Realizing this, I started to put two and two together, and now suspect that the breakup was a way to push me away, likely because of her ED, and possibly because of the stress she is feeling about her desire to take a leap forward and put on weight. I've also read up quite a bit on the topic, and this seems to be a pretty common response for people in similar situations - to push away people who are already deeply involved in the process, sometimes for fear of disappointing them, or not wanting to let go of their ED just yet, even if they know it is the right thing to do (Having battled addiction in the past, and can definitely relate to this).We agreed to stay friends, and texted back and forth - almost as if nothing had happened - for the next 24 hrs or so. We even hung out again two nights later. Everything felt natural. Nothing affectionate, but we both had a really great time, and she told me as much at the end of the night. She has had a difficult time with affection for a few months now, so when she hugged me tightly for a really long time before leaving, I felt so happy, and thought that maybe this was all just a necessary bump in the road, and that everything would be just fine. She even told me she realized that she was pushing people away, and that she was going to make an effort to be more accepting of people's help by not doing it anymore.So we made plans to see each other again a few days later, but they fell through. The connection that felt restored just a few nights earlier had suddenly evaporated again, and by the end of the week, she was ignoring calls and texts. Finally, she reached out on the weekend to let me know that she decided to go stay with a friend in another town for the next two weeks, and that she wouldn't be able to see me for a while. She said she's not sure if she wants to be friends, and that maybe we shouldn't talk anymore - at least for a really, really long time until she feels ready. I can't help but feel that this is an attempt to push me even further away. It is like she knows that I want to help, and that I'm the only one who knows what she's going through (I don't mean to sound as if I know what her ED feels like, but rather that I am the only one whom she regularly opens up to about it). It almost feels as if she would rather lose me than lose her ED. This makes me feel confused and a bit sad, but I am not upset, nor am I willing to lose hope. What she is going through is not her fault.It's been a week since she left town, and we have managed to communicate a little bit - mostly just discussing our situation. She talks as if she wants to totally cut me off and get over our relationship entirely, which I am having a hard time accepting, especially considering just a few weeks ago, everything was fine, and outside of her recent developments with her ED and school, we were inseparable, and on great terms. Although she is insistent on needing her space, she still responds to texts, and we've had an ongoing conversation for a few days now, although it does take a while for replies. On the whole, it feels like I am being erased.  Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this sort of situation? I want to strike a balance between giving her space, and staying in touch. Ideally, I want to be with her, but more than anything, I want to be able to communicate, and to help her in any way that I can. I have written her a few letters telling her how I feel. I try to be as supportive of her ED as possible, as well as make her feel as comfortable as I can. But whenever I do try to bring up her ED, and its relation to our current situation, she avoids it altogether.Thanks so much for reading!

7,MegLeg,01/15/2021,Advice for Helping Boyfriend with BED (+ Bipolar II),"Hi everyone,
I just joined this forum and haven't found any posts regarding binge eating disorder. Lately, my relationship with my (live-in) boyfriend has been a bit strained. Almost all our day-to-day responsibilities have shifted onto me over time and I need to talk to him about this because it's causing me to feel depressed most days. But I'm also really concerned about his eating habits because they've been getting worse.He's diagnosed with binge eating disorder and has insomnia (due to the bipolar disorder) and he's been sneaking more and more junk food while I'm sleeping. I get our weekly groceries (including healthy snacks he likes! and he gets input in the list) and do all the cooking for us but he works part-time at a pharmacy and brings home snacks every day he works. He also drinks energy drinks all day. Whenever I ask him what he got, he lies about what's in the bag (telling me about 1-2 of the items, leaving the others in the bag as if I can't see them) and then he justifies the purchases to me based on their price (""well I only got this because it was only $3 for 2"") kind of making it seem like he HAD to purchase it.Our days are so different it feels like we're living completely separate lives - I get up at 7:30 and clean up wrappers/plates/etc he left out the night before, take care of our pets, get ready for work. I have lunch at 12:30 or so and if it's an off-day for him, he won't get out of bed until around 3pm. I get off work at 4 and do some more house chores or errands and make us dinner (anywhere from 5:30-7:30). After dinner, I'm so exhausted and usually feeling frustrated at him (probably a little bit of jealously, too if I'm being honest) and I don't want to do anything except curl up and read. But at this point, he's ready to hang out, play video games and watch tv together. After I go to bed at 11pm, this is when he struggles with binge eating. He usually starts around 12 or 1am and sometimes has gone as long as eating continuously until 6am. Usually he finishes eating by like 3am and then he immediately goes to bed once he's done eating. We sleep in separate rooms (due to the insomnia) and I often find even more food/wrappers hidden in his bedroom. I have to write in sharpie ""for a recipe"" on anything that's off-limits at night because there have been times I had to go to the grocery store to replace something he ate at night.Lately I feel like I'm teetering back and forth between feeling like I'm being controlling and feeling like I'm being steamrolled and completely losing myself in the relationship. I almost never feel balanced between those 2 feelings. He kind of has this habit of shifting responsibility onto me. Like when he first moved in 2 yrs ago, he wanted me to find a way to lock the fridge and keep the key from him at night - which feels really unfair to me (or maybe I'm a bad caretaker?).Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How can you show you care without making it feel like a parent-child relationship? It's hard to approach the topic because he has a history of being shamed for his weight.Thanks in advance!",_admin_moderator,"Fri,01/15/2021-5:26pm","Dear MegLeg,Welcome to the","Dear MegLeg,Welcome to the forums!

8,jareddj3,12/16/2020,wife recent diagnosis,"good day everyone, this will br my first post, i wish i found this forum earlier. a brief history on my situation, my wife was recently diagnosed 2 months ago (nov 2020) with anorexia by a psychiatrist. few month before this, maybe summer 2020, she started converting to a specific diet ( she eats a regular diet prior), when I asked why, she said she is limiting her caloric intake to lose weight. she has been doing indoor cycling for about 3 yrs.this year she added beach body on her exercise routine on top of her daily cycling. I notice her mood getting worst, she gets irritated easily, she is more withdrawn and depressed as well. I asked her how much is her daily caloric intake is, and she said she limits herself to X calories/daily. i asked her this because i notice that she spends her off days grocery shopping and preparing her meals all day. she weighs each and every ingredient, and makes sure that she eats <X calories/day.she states that this is the only way to she lost weight, and she finally is getting to her weight goal of X lbs. while all this is happening, i told her she might be anorexic and we should consult a psychiatrist. she agreed with me, because she said she want to prove to me that she is fine.
after a long wait, we finally got our appointment, she was diagnosed with Anorexia nervosa, anxiety disorder and depression. she was referred to a nutritionist and started on a medication.
Our nutritionist has been great, she informed her that she needs to increase her caloric intake, and stop using the exercise bike (she complied to this) the dietitian also gave her a guide for her meal plan, which she refused to follow. all this happened in the last 2 weeks, the dietitian asked me to weigh her blindly, she was able to take a peek of her weight and she freaked out. I decided to hide our scale at home so she would stop monitoring, she said she feels like she is gaining weight and will need to keep her diet. last weekend while at work, she felt lightheaded and had a hard time focusing, so she asked to go home early, she was instructed to go stop by an urgent care if she can just to be sure she is ok before going home. all her vital signs appeared normal, and they did a set of labs. we assume the results was normal since we have not heard anything from them. she decided to call insick for the next day just to rest.
monday came, and she felt normal, and we updated our dietitian on what happened in the last 2 days, and she recommended that my wife go into an inpatient rehab. my wife did not take this lightly,
she told me she would try to follow the diet  recommended as long as she doesn’t go in rehab. so yesterday, she finally ate a regular light meal, and we went grocery shoping for her meals this week. she is trying to comply and i know it is against her will and she is not happy. the nutritionist touched bases with me and i told her the progress. she said she is worried about refeeding syndrome and will
talk to my wife again. i know for a fact that my wife will never agree to go to rehab at this point, I am just lost on how to handle this at this point and I know we have a long road ahead of us. I hope someone can chime in and give their suggestions on our situation, I apologize for the long narrative",_admin_moderator,"Wed,12/16/2020-6:14pm","Dear jareddj3, welcome to the","Dear jareddj3, welcome to the NEDA Forums!

10,Helpneeded,10/24/2020,Daily vomiting causing weight loss,"Hi all,My partner (in her 40s) has for the past year suffered daily bouts of vomiting.  She has been diagnosed with a form of arthritis and was on biologic injections.  About a year ago she would start being sick maybe a few times a week then slowly it has gotten to the stage where she vomits after every meal, drink - even to the point where she will vomit tablets she took half hour earlier.Due to covid and a useless GP, tests had been delayed, however she has undergone lots of imagine tests - no cause has shown up yet.What concerns me is her low BMI.  She went for an MRI on tuesday and she was so dehydrated, they couldnt insert the canula into any of her arms.  She has had a bad relationship with food over the years and would fit the criteria for anorexia, certainly many years ago this was the case where a previous GP told her she was borderline anorexic.She swears that she is not making herself sick and I do believe her - the Drs must believe her too because no one has made any effort to refer her to a specialist.Is daily vomiting like this something you would see in an eating disorder?The latest help we received was some powdered drinks full of nutrients. Sadly these are all but useless as they are down the toilet 15 minutes later.Getting more and more concerned as her BMI falls.Thanks in advance.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,10/26/2020-9:00am",Medical Symptoms,"Hi Helpneeded, welcome to the forums.

11,sayia_valentine,09/16/2020,Advice?!?,"Hey everyone!! Im reaching out for advice because I am feeling alot of anxiety right now. For the past month or so I havent been working , I lost my job due to COVID. Well I start my new job and will be gone for 8 hours a day. My fiance is currently unemployed and is home all day, and with his ED I know he usually doesn't eat when I'm not home to remind him. Im super anxious and worried about him being alone all day, and him not eating during the day while I'm gone. Currently he only eats X cals a day while I'm there and im super stressed about him eating less then that when I'm gone. Hes aware of my concerns and we have talked about it. Im still just anxious about it and would like to know more ways I can help him eat without being overbearing while I'm at work. He already said we could video call so I can make sure he eats when I'm on lunch and I already told him ill order him food when we can. But I would like advice on how to not only not be as anxious about it but to help him as well.

12,alyki8,09/15/2020,Will you still love me if I put on weight,"Hi everyone, I've posted in this forum before, but just to re-hash, I am a senior in high school with a girlfriend suffering from anorexia. She was diagnosed officially about 3/4 months ago and is seeing a psychologist weekly and regularly visiting a doctor to keep tabs on her progress. She has successfully put on a bit of weight but I know is still finding things very challenging, especially in conjunction with all of our school stress (there is about 6 weeks until our final exams which will determine whether or not we get into university). Hearing some of your stories is so inspiring - especially hearing about people who have been supporting their partners through EDs for years, if not decades. I almost feel selfish sharing this, but I am beginning to find it quite challenging to support my girlfriend.The emotional labour that I need to put into our relationship is starting to take a bit of a toll. I am always really, really tired, I will get sudden bouts of sadness and anxiety for no real reason and when she lashes out at me (when having a bad mental health day) I feel really guilty, quite awful about myself and feel like I can't do anything right. The impact of all this is that I am finding it increasingly challenging to focus on school work and I am feeling really unmotivated. I know that this is all being impacted by Covid-19 as well, but I feel like I can definitely attribute some of it to our interactions. I'd say our communication is pretty good - we speak on the phone at least every second day and we always try to talk about issues that we are having, how we are feeling or anything like that. For further context, the city in which I live is in total lockdown - we are unable to leave our houses for more than one hour a day and even, we can only do so whilst wearing a mask and go out for exercise. I am able to see my girlfriend face to face around once every two weeks (under a rule that allows 'intimate partners' to visit each other) and I am currently completing school work on an online platform. This has been the case for around 3 months. More broadly, the mental health impact has been really awful, around 1000 people have commit suicide during this period because it is so difficult not being able to socialise/go to work/go to school.  The combined effect of these two factors (my girlfriend and my social isolation) is having a pretty bad impact on my mental health overall. I'm not really sure what to do because I obviously want to continue supporting my girlfriend in whatever way I can, but when she says things like 'will you still love me if I put on weight?', 'I have no friends except for you' or 'I'm not good enough/won't achieve anything in life/I'm dragging you down' I just get so upset and so anxious, which in turn puts a strain on our relationship. I can't distance myself from her because a) she will notice b) I don't want to and c) communication is so important given that we can't see each other face to face because of covid. I'm just at a bit of a loss as to what to do. I feel so tired all the time, but I really want to make our relationship work, but not at the jeopardy of my school work or my own mental health. Does anyone have any effective coping mechanisms for a situation like this?",_admin_moderator,"Tue,09/15/2020-3:51pm",Dear alyki8,"We are sorry to hear you are struggling and wanted to make sure you had some resources.

13,sayia_valentine,09/02/2020,UpDate,"Hi guys! I just wanted to post an update on what's been going on.
My first post was about my fiance and his Twitter. We talked and I agreed to let him keep it so he can vent all of his thoughts out so he doesn't self harm. As of right now he he still taking laxatives and eating low calories. However from what he's told me is he's eaten more then he has in months. So that's good.
However, even though I had never been diagnosed with  an ED myself, it did trigger some of my own issues but im working on those. I guess my next thing is, how do i stay supportive and positive for him? I do get worried when I see him using fast apps and calorie counters. Also are there other support groups? I've looked on FB but can't find any for partners and I just feel as if I'm alone. Thanks",_admin_moderator,"Fri,09/04/2020-11:54am",Resources ,"Hi!

14,benberk27,08/04/2020,When things get bad?,"I'm in a bit of a moral pickle and looking for some advice.My GF struggles with bulimia. We've been on and off for almost 4 years now. On the most recent stretch things got bad. She took on a new job with a ton of stress. ED got much worse, and she started saying things she's never said before. She was having suicidal thoughts, heart issues, was very scared, and had reached a point where she openly admitted she couldn't fight ED on her own.This was pretty scary, but I tried not to overreact. I tried to sit down with her and talk about options for recovery, but she got mad saying she just needed support not a 'list'. I tried to take a more active role, out of fear, but that just made it worse.Most recently she pushed away saying she needed to do it herself because it's the only way she knows how. I'm used to this by now, and I understand where she's coming from and support her in recovery, whatever that looks like.But I'm scared. In the 4 years I've known her I've never seen her this bad. She has never mentioned suicide, ever. What can or should I do?I sent her a text asking how I could support her? She never responded. I understand that could be an impossible question given what she's going through. Thank you.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,08/05/2020-7:43pm",Resources,"Hi!

15,chuckdiesel,08/21/2020,The Struggle Is Real - GF has bulimia and found out last night,"Hard to say where to begin or even what to write. This has been a struggle and it hasn't even been a full 24 hours. Sorry for the length of the post, its just that I don't know of anyone that has gone through this, and I learned about this forum from calling the hotline. Earlier this week I went to bed and woke up to find my girlfriend of two years standing by the coat closet digging through her purse in the middle of the night. I thought it was odd and questioned what she was doing and she responded that she was checking the front door to make sure it was locked. She was inebriated, and we have a smart lock that notifies you when the lock has changed from locked to unlocked. I didn't receive a notification, thought it was odd, and went to sleep. When I woke up, I couldn't get rid of that nagging feeling that something wasn't right. That my gut was telling me that something was off. I went to her purse and found laxatives. This isn't the first time that I had found it, and even though I'm a nurse, I did not realize about laxative abuse in bulimics. Fast forward three days, and every morning, I woke up, counted the pills, and realizing that she was taking them after I went to bed or during work the next day. I suspect this has been occurring for YEARS, we went to Disney right before it shut down in March, and I found an empty pill sheet inside an item that we used then. I have no idea how long this has been going on. Last night, I told her that I knew of the laxative abuse, that I was concerned for her health, and listed the symptoms or behaviors that I was concerned about. She always goes to the bathroom after dinner and I have brought this up several times during our 2 years together. She gaslighted me, making me think that I am delusional and crazy. I stood my ground last night, even when asking about the laxatives she lied and told me its a once in a blue moon type of thing. When I told her that I knew it was going on for several days this week, that is when I encountered the full shut down. She only admitted a problem when I said that I hope I was wrong about my beliefs/concerns.Since last night she will barely talk to me and won't look at me. We live together (a house that I purchased) and she will not be in the same room as me. It is incredibly sad. I don't know what to do right now. Not to detract too much, but my last relationship ended when I found my girlfriend cheating on me with my boss. Needless to say that I no longer work at that company, but that trust is a huge foundation of which I value in relationships, and I have had that conversation with my current girlfriend.She won't talk to me about normal things: work, the dog, how her day went - nothing. She gives short, terse answers, and says that she needs time, which I am willing to give. She wants an open ended, no goal date for this moratorium and I would not budge on that boundary, which I feel like is important. She, as far as I know, is not interested in therapy or talking to anyone, and has told me that I am the only person to know (which I take with a grain of salt). She says that she will never forgive me if I tell anyone about this without her permission, and I told her that I will not live without a support structure of my own and I will not make that promise. That I have no idea what I am talking about. It seems to me that she is trying to wrest the control of her secret back, now that it has been exposed. I don't know if her family is a trigger or not, and they are halfway across the country. Nor do I know if they know.I feel stupid for not questioning this sooner, I am a nurse. I asked questions about the little things that didn't add up, but I never put two and two together for the bigger picture. The chapped lips (allergies/climate change from move), the sores/bruising on the back of her hands (manual labor), the constant going to the bathroom after dinner (IBS), constantly being cold (just normal). I saw another post on here that said poor wound healing is a major concern and that is something that is occurring right now. She constantly gets nicks and scraps on her shins and ankles, picks at them, and they will not heal. She is supposed to go for an OB/GYN visit next week and does not have a PCP. As far as I know she has never had blood work done. Part of me is writing so I can get this all out there and take a deep breath. I am incredibly grateful for anyone that reads it, let alone offers anything in return. I understand that this is the beginning of a journey and I do not know how long it will go for or where it will take me. I will be learning as much as possible, and have immense respect for anyone that is going through this or worse.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,08/23/2020-11:01pm","Hi chuckdiesel, thank you for","Hi chuckdiesel, thank you for posting.

16,BF359,08/13/2020,I don't know what to do,my girlfriend and I began dating just a few months ago but I have known her longer than that. I know that she has struggled with her eating disorder in the past but she was doing better. She's reverting back to her old habits because she wants to look better for me despite constant reassurance that she looks amazing. I read that she may be doing this as a way to regain a sense of control during a hectic time. I haven't been the best boyfriend lately but I would never break up with her. It's hard for me to help her because we're young and I have no idea what I am doing. Not to mention I am also doing this alone because her family doesn't really care and my family doesn't even know that she is my girlfriend.

17,alyki8,07/02/2020,My girlfriend's fresh diagnosis,"Hello everyone, I am a new member of this forum. Unfortunately, my girlfriend was today diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. I was pretty shattered by this news, as I imagine many partners/spouses are. I feel somewhat culpable - I should have noticed, I should have acted earlier, I should have helped. I know these are all irrational thoughts and that it is not my fault, but I feel them nonetheless.My girlfriend verbalised to me about a month ago that she was struggling with eating. She said that if in one month's time she hadn't reached a specified weight (she did not tell me what this was) she would seek professional health. True to her word she did so and received the diagnosis. I know that in the past she has also struggled with anxiety, self-harm and depressive episodes. We are both in our final year of high school. It has been an incredibly stressful year in terms of school work, friendships etc. She is particularly susceptible to stress. We were also in lockdown due to Covid-19 for approximately three months meaning that we missed all of that face-to-face school. This was a period of time in which she lost a lot of weight, isolated herself socially and struggled with mental health. Oftentimes, I was the ONLY person that she would talk to outside of her family. I am grateful that she felt comfortable enough to communicate honestly but it was oftentimes pretty frightening.I am the only person outside of her family that knows of this issue. I am trying to be diligent about how I can best support her and have been reading up all afternoon about the disorder itself, different methods of support, recovery time and techniques. I have come to this forum, however, to ask specifically if anyone has been in a similar situation. Has anyone had to deal with their final year of school, all the stress that comes with that, and an unwell loved one? Or being the sole non-familial supporter? The other thing I am concerned about is maintaining an equal and loving relationship alongside a mental illness. She also received a fairly early diagnosis - how can I help her slipping further into the grips of this illness?I am not sure of what demographic uses this forum (I imagine it is varied), but I hope that you all can understand that despite being young, I really think that this girl is the one for me. I love her so dearly and it pains me greatly to see her suffering. I want to help in whatever ways I can because this relationship and this person mean the world to me. I am in for the long haul. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
