0,"My wife is concerned I have an unhealthy relationship with food because I count calories and macros daily. I do have a bit of body dysmorphia because of a lot of things:
When I was a kid I was very skinny as a wrestler, so that did harbor a negative relationship with food at a young age. College freed me from that and I put on a ton of weight rapidly. Then I lost a lot of weight to get healthier about 4 yes after graduation, which focused mostly on avoiding certain foods and exercising. And I was in a stage performance in 2019 where I lost weight to fit a vision, but I had the understanding that I wouldn't ever do that again once the show ended.
Since then I've just been counting to make sure I eat the right amount of food for my size, and keep things balanced. This to me feels like a more generalized idea of eating. I also exercise several times a week. I'm not skipping meals, though I do tend to skip a snack in the day and then binge later at night.
Is this obsessive? Or some type of disorder?

1,"It started last year ,while i was 18 years old.I spent a rough year stressing over exams and at the same period i was really afraid not to gain any weight ,because of the limited time i had to workout .My weight was never a real problem .Nevertheless, i started developing in my head this constant fear of gaining weight.So , i balanced my time between reading and working out daily.I also had a pretty strict diet(cutting out certain food groups),which i maintained for 2 months and lost some weight .People started commenting on my beautiful body so i felt really uplifted .Everything felt great and even though i was extremely pressured ,i managed to balance all that and was feeling really healthy.I feel that the real problem started developing the summer after the exams .After all that pressure ,i could finally let loose of myself.So i stopped watching my diet and gradually till august i had gained all the  weight back.I still felt ok with my weight as i knew that other people couldn't really tell the difference.But i started feeling more dissatisfied with myself than ever before.My clothes would't fit me perfectly and my eating habits had gotten back to normal.I was at 0 .And then...quarantine gave me a hard slap on the face.I couldn't play volleyball anymore,which was my passion since forever.I couldn't go to college , took online courses instead.I couldn't see my friends .It was a big change in my life ,it felt like everything was falling apart.I think i spent months being depressed,arguing with my parents,doing nothing productive with my life .They didn't even allow us celebrate christmas with our loved ones.I could literally see my life passing by...I think that's when i started finding confort in food.All i did was binge eating ,watching series all day and feeling bad about myself.
   After those months ,coffee shops and gym were finally open again .My decision was to take advantage of my free time and get out of that cycle.So i started working at a coffe shop ,took driving classes,enrolled to the gym etc.I thought it was all over .I thought that keeping myself busy would make my food problem disapear .Instead i was always exhausted from work and started binging even more.I still couldn't realize i had a problem.I spent the whole summer thinking about my body and my weight.Then summer ended..
  The now: Now ,a year later, i finally left town to go to a university.I'm still adapting to the new life:new home,new town ,new people ...As one can imagine im pretty stressed.At first ,i really tried eating healthy and maintaining my weight.But now,i find myself binge eating exta amounts of food uncontrolably.I just can't control myself.I consume food till i can't move from the pain .Then i feel awful and weak ,but i always end up doing it again .Im Often so swollen and embarassed to get out .I cancel my plans and sit home all day hurting.I've tried purging.Today i made it for the first time.It was this moment i realized things are serious and im not just simply walk away from something like this .It sickenes my mind even thinking about it .Im desperate,im afraid,i can't control it ,don't know what's hapening and why ...I just want to stop worrying about my weight .Please help.
P.S. I have trichotillomania(since i was little),developed severe dermatillomania in puberty and im pretty sure i have a light form of OCD even though im not diagnosed.I 'm also a perfectionist (took me years to realize).

2,"Hi All, I just want to ask if anyone ever tried using medical cannabis as an alternative meds for anorexia? I have read many articles about medical marijuana and how it can help you in terms of eating disorder, anxiety disorders and panic attacks, inflammation, even cancer and a lot more. Like this review on a certain strain called sour tangie. Cbd and thc are also new to me and I don't even smoke. If this is true I cant find any solid conclusive evidence that speaks to its efficacy. Any personal experience or testimonial would be highly appreciated. Thanks

3,"Hi guys, this is kinda scary lol.  Anyways I am a 19 year old male, a freshman in college.  I am reaching out because I am scared to talk to people I know in person about this topic.  I have not gone to the doctor about any of my mental health concerns due to fear of my parents overworrying about me which makes me stress out more.  If I say that I have a mental health disorder or imply that I feel like I have it, and I do not but this process offends anybody I sincerely apologize.
I have been struggling with what I feel is anxiety for years now, but it is not to the point where it messes with my functionality so I think i'm fine there.  I started having what i belive to be bipolar episodes in eight grade.  I go through phases where I am extremely depressed, but then something can happen and I will become extremly happy, but I am also more happy than sad so IDK if I qualify as bipolar.  Now with the eating disorder it has been going on since freshman year.  I would change my body to what other people wanted.  During football season I was a lineman and would gain weight to be at my heaviest.  I was 5 foot 5 at the time.  I would do this by stuffing myself full of food.  During baseball season however I would need to lose weight, the lowest I got during baseball was less than my heaviest and I was 5 foot 7.  The way I acheived this was by starving myself for 2-3 days while doing my atheltics.  Then I would gourge myself for a day, feel terrible and start over. I was so proud of the number on the scale, but still hate the way my body looks.  About 3 months ago I stopped starving myself and havent felt like this, but recently I have started hating my body again even though I havent put on any weight and I feel that I am going to fall back into that cycle.

4,"hello, i would like to start off by just saying that i havent been diagnosed with an ED or anything like that, and im only posting here cos i dont really know where else to go. anyway, my mental health isnt the best and whenever i feel like a bit of a failure, i feel like i dont deserve a meal. its like i have to do something to deserve that meal, for example, finish all my schoolwork, and whenever i feel like ive failed my schoolwork or ive not completed it to a good standard, its like my brain tells itself im not allowed to eat. im not really sure if its just a mindset or what but people are starting to notice how thin im getting. ive tried to force myself to eat anyway but i either get heavily put off my food or i throw it back up. (not sure if it matters but im a 15 year old male. also feel free to ask literally any questions about me or my eating habits.
thank you for any help and advice.

5,"Recently I looked at a picture taken almost a year ago with my mother and father, and I looked significantly taller than my Mom and basically my dad's height. I was about 5 months into my disorder. Now a year later, I've regained weight and started eating a lot about 3 months or so ago, and I notice that my mom and I are closer in height compared to the photo. I've also had low T symptoms for the duration of my ed and still recovering from my hormones. My left knee does feel weird compared to my other. I am also getting a physical examination tomorrow to make sure I am healthy.

6,"(Excuse my english grammar).  So 2 years ago I am very obese teen, and then I suddenly want to lose weight cause I’m very ashamed of my body and I have a family history of diabetes & high blood pressure so I try to workout and  and loose some weight to be in a healthy range, In 2 years and of course.  I am very happy that I loss that tremendous amount of weight in my age, to be healthier and so I can wear all my fitted clothes. So the next month I come up  a plan for exercising and eating healthy and also the time I bought a scale thats the start of my scale obsession start and also my eating disorder/problem it started when I watch mukbang videos/cooking shows/food vlogs. At first I said i’m gonna eat only certain foods and because I have money I can buy food whatever I want and how much I want to consume I hide a food from my cousin and to mom in my closet go outside when my mom and cousin are busy, then increase how much I eat, which is very high for my age and it very depressing for me and concerning. 
 I’m suffering from food addiction,binge eating, eating disorders or some case I have Bulimia for almost a month now. I didn’t go to the doctor and I don’t want to tell my mom cause she doesn’t even care whats happening to me and I don’t have money to go to a dietitian. I was very concerned about my health. I tried to put my money on my moms piggy bank so I cannot use it but I always have an idea to get the money back and change my self I always exercise doing a calorie deficit but my diet only become successful at the first day that I tried it and then the next day I binge my self to fullness. I gained back some weight and also my clothes are starting to shrink I am so very depressed how can I change my life again. I don’t know how long this can last. Maybe I’m getting back to being obese before this thing go away and become fully recovered.

A brief history-- fitness is a huge part of my life, so of course it only makes sense than it would be enveloped in one of the biggest struggles in my life. I am prone to big time sugar binges, and am able to admit that it's a problem, I'm addicted, and I need help.
I'm currently going through a recovery book - In it, one of the principle parts is getting help from others, even complete strangers, ideally with a recovery plan of their own, to help keep each other on the set path to fighting this battle and winning daily.
If any of you are interested in helping me on my quest, I can gladly be that partner-in-crime for you as well, as iron sharpens iron, and we help each other win this tough, lifelong battle. If so, please private message me a brief description of what you deal with, and I'll respond as soon as I can and we can swap emails for further communication!

9,"TW: Addiction (specifically stimulants)
Hi, I need to vent on here because friends aren't forever and family has a loud mouth.
I'm an 18yr male and just made it half way thru my first year of college (ironically psychology major). As a kid I was always known as the ""skinny kid"" since most of the cousins my age were heavier than me. Then around the age of 9, after the best cruise to the Bahamas with the grandparents, I came back a more fitting member of my cousins. Everyone made comments, some were mean, but my mom's left scars. It felt like I fell off a ladder I didn't even know I was standing on. I didn't do much about it, I hated my body, but I guess not enough until my freshman year of high school when I started using my prescribed medication (with some lovely side affects) to erase some history. Though, I never consistently took them until about 6 months ago. 
Ever since then I've depended on stimulants to maintain my grades and body (as a college students that's basically my entire life) and I've lost a noticeable amount. I'm starting to think it's less about my weight and more about the feeling of stimulants on an empty stomach, but beginning to feel satisfied with my body is another awesome high I've never felt. I've also started being more active and taking other stuff whenever I reopen those scars. I realize the consequences of my past decisions and the ones I'm making now. I'm not ready to open that door until I am happy with my body (gotta have something nice to sleep on). I feel like I've been preparing for the worst since that horrible cruise.
Sad thing is I always though I'd settle with my body being ""average"", but there's always a step higher on the ladder.
But I hate to end on a bad note so now I'm going to go watch my favorite show.
"
10,"To start I am 18, a considerably moderate/healthy weight, lets just say i have a long way before my thigh gap closes.
I hate that I over eat, I don't count my food, but I have enough knowledge to know that I'm eating way beyond healthy portions. I typically don't start eating till about 12, but have recently been eating breakfast at school cause I've even started to get hungry then. When I do eat I bring food to go along with school lunch or whatever I've made for the day, (school lunch typically has smaller nutritional values of everything you need to make up for what some kids may not be getting at home)
After that I eat a snack.
Then for dinner we typically have protein heavy meals, but there are always carb and veggie options. I usually eat about 4 servings of everything at dinner. (like right now I just had a meal, started with a small plate and waited for everyone to eat, then went back for more)
At about 1 AM I eat whatever I can find.
I eat all this during the week, the weekends are similar but my meal times are much more unplanned and also more of what my body considers a ""snack""
I currently do not do much for physical activity, I am in band, I play mallet percussion, and I sleep about 12 hours a day. 
I honestly have no clue why I cannot gain weight, or why I even eat like this, it's gotten to a point where I'm scared to stop because I may lose weight, or I could develop things like diabetes or other diseases from changing my diet to something my body isn't used to.
"
11,"This is going to be a bit of an unorganized train of thought, so please bare with me. I'm still processing all of this.
I've struggled with my body image for my entire life. It's been almost an obsession. Ever since I was a teenager, I have spent large parts of my day looking over myself in the mirror. I've had to stare at my face in the rear view mirror while driving. I've had to turn and look at my reflection in every single store window that I've passed. At work or with friends I've often found myself pulling out my phone to look at myself in the selfie camera. I'd never take any pictures -- I hated all of them -- but it was like a portable mirror. It's been agonizing. I've gone through diet and exercise binges more times than I can count. I'd run so much that my legs and joints would begin to ache. I've lost and gained absurd amounts of weight multiple times in just the last three years.
I remember a night two years ago in particular that was particularly hard. I was a summer Resident assistant in a dorm at my university, and while the entire building was staffed, only two of the floors had residents -- the rest were set aside to rent out to conferences. I had my own room for the first time in years, and the bathroom was built into the bedroom. The room was sized for three, and the floor had 50 rooms, but for the most part only I and one other person were up there. None of my friends were in town, so I spent most of my time by myself in an over-sized room in an empty dorm. It was oppressive, and my body image concerns exploded. This one particular night, I was up until well past three in the morning staring at myself shirtless in the mirror. I'd go sit at my computer and play some games, only to feel the compulsion to get up and do it again. I spent hours just sitting there, staring at myself -- revolted by what I saw. I had a couple of panic attacks. It's not as bad today, but I still do it. I'll get up multiple times a day, pretend to use the bathroom, and then spend that time just gawking at myself in the mirror. Sometimes I'll weigh myself a few times a day, too.
I finally sought help this last December. My girlfriend of one year had left me, and I felt utterly worthless. I was spending those long hours in front of a mirror over and over again. It didn't help that by that point, the relationship and the pandemic caused me to gain back all of the weight that I had previously lost. By sheer chance, the therapist I saw for anxiety was a specialist in eating disorders, and she first diagnosed me with Binge Eating disorder and we've been working on that since the start of February. Yesterday, she amended that diagnosis to include Body Dysmorphic Disorder because of my compulsive tendencies. 
I'm relieved to finally be getting treatment, but I also feel weird and anxious about all of this. I'm the only male patient that my therapist has, and I'm going to be the only man in the eating disorder support group that I'll be starting soon. Most of the resources that I've found and my therapist had available were oriented towards women, and that stigma makes it really difficult to discuss it with anyone. I also find myself constantly doubting my diagnoses, and falling back into unconscious dietary restriction or extreme exercise. I've been obsessing about numbers. It's like I'm fighting back against the notion that there's something wrong with me so that I can go right back to restriction. 
I feel kind of stuck in this by myself. I don't really have a support system outside of therapy. All of this is honestly stressful and confusing.

12,"Hey everyone! I am currently at a residential treatment center for mood and anxiety and I just want to share my story of the eating disorder that has taken over my life. Feel free to share or reply with anything you feel comfortable with, or anything that you might relate to! I’m currently 18 years old and I have been struggling with my ED for a little over two and a half years. I have always struggled with self confidence, body image, depression, but one year it kind of took me to the point of starting to do unhealthy behaviors and it took over my life. About two years ago I was in a relationship with an athlete and being active was their life. Seeing them I always felt as if my body, my performance, or just what I looked like in general was not good enough. Subconsciously I thought that if I lost weight that is would be more likely that 1) I’d be good enough and 2) I’d feel better about myself. That’s when the target behaviors began, and it really took over my life. I was constantly thinking about food, counting every calorie, and restricting very extremely the day after I had had a target behavior incidence, or I would just do the target behavior every day multiple times a day. It was miserable. The person I was in a relationship with new nothing about my mental health or eating disorder, and for a while not a single person did so I just felt lonelier and lonelier and it got worse and worse. I thought losing weight would help but no matter how much weight I lost or what I looked like I was never happy. Being an athlete on top of all of this made it so much worse. Without getting any nutrients I made no progress with sports. I would be in the weight room 3-4 times a week for about two years, and I made no progress. With my ED it made progress practically impossible, and any time the weights did go up and I made any sort of progress, my ED got worse and I lost it all 20x faster than I made it. All my friends were lifting gettin bigger and stronger, and I was the only one who was lifting and getting weaker. Being a young male with the majority of my friends being talented athletes, it really didn’t help. I was embarrassed by my size, wether I thought I was big or small at the time, I was embarrassed by my performance, the weights I could lift, and pretty much everything. This was life, and it was only getting worse. I felt extremely depressed every day, guilty, and like a failure because I couldn’t control my eating habits. My girlfriend would make fun of me for not eating a lot and I would kind of just laugh itoff, but she had zero clue that the night before I had binged and purged significantly to the point where I didn’t want to even looks at food because I thought it would somehow make me gain weight. The day of my very first track meet I took off my shirt to change into a jersey and a couple guys told me “ you aren’t built for this sport” and I had a mom come up to me after words and say I was too skinny and I needed to eat food. I couldn’t win no matter what I did, and I still thought I needed to lose weight. I have a picture of me very thin and it was supposed to be the “ before” picture for a “ weight loss journey”. To me it was never the number on the scale even though seeing it go down helped, but I just was never happy with how I looked. The thought of my girlfriend having any affection towards me was impossible, just because I couldnt believe anyone else could love me just cause I don’t see any positives about myself. My last season of soccer was two years ago, last year was cancelled cause of Covid, and I am not able to participate this year because of my mental health. I feel like the ED has taken everything from me. I am still struggling, but I want to end this story with some positives. I am getting help. I am currently at a residential center and even though I still feel hopeless, it feels better just to be doing something about it. Eating disorders really suck, especially while you’re an athlete. No matter what age you are, gender, anything, just know you’re not alone. Asking for help isn’t easy, but I can say from experience that this is nearly impossible to do alone. Thanks for taking the time to read this, I hope everyone is taking a step towards recovery and making a change for the better.

13,"Hi, my name is Patrick and I am 36 years old. I am reaching out bc I am losing weight regularly and not eating well. I haven’t ate well in about two months. I was losing weight during the winter and my doctor did tests on me. They all came back fine and well. I was healthy. Since March, I have not ate well at all. I consume little during the day and at nighttime and that’s bad. I lose a few pounds a week estimated. I fear swallowing and eating due to an episode back in March when i did choke on some food. I fear if I when I eat now I’ll choke, have heartburn, be bloated, or excessively burp. All of these symptoms are true to a degree. My doctor doesn’t seem to want to help me after a few months ago. My family is unsure how to help me thru this crisis of mine. I’m unsure what to do next. I did reach out to a counselor for help that’s a start. I should call my doctor back but what to say something but what. They will be horrified of how I look. My family is horrified of my appearance as well. My weight loss is the cause. I’m at a crossroads. I care about my health and want to get better. I’m unemployed for the past few months as well. Life has been a challenge a well. It seems to be better to be stuck in old ways and not care. Feel free to message me back with any thoughts or feedback would be appreciated. Thanks, Patrick

14,"So I’ve always been bigger than I should be but in the last 10 years I’ve gained a significant amount I fascinate about food, I drive past a shop and think “they sell that” then I go and buy it all and eat it all. For example I could easily got to Morrison’s and buy way too much. Then eat it all in the car on the way home and then come home and eat something else. yesterday I did the above and then for lunch a really large meal, followed by a large dinner. I litteraley never feel full and never feel hungry. a few years ago I was lucky and got onto afitness programme the local authority was running which was 12 weeks of boot camps X times per week and lost some weight really enjoyed life. (I was lucky enough to do the programme twice) but then politics got in the way and I didn’t feel welcome there. move tried joining gyms but I got X or X times. I always feel embarrassed. I got into running and ran a few ks but then I hurt my shoulder and I can’t get back going, I always feel embarrassed the minute I see someone else walking. ive been to the GP many times over the years and told them I feel like an alcoholic would but with food, I was referred to a lifestyle programme but it’s one where after a few weeks they don’t want to be seeing you every week. I went back to the GP and was givenn medication but that didn’t work either. I’ve also taken medication on and off over the years with no joy. I joined a different programme for X months and put on weight I paid to go private and see a physiatrist but after 3 appointments all he was getting me to do was fill in food diaries so I didn’t go back. I really don’t know what else to do, I feel like I’ll never beat this and no one will ever understand my problem or be able to help me. I have a young daughter and I’m embarrassed to be out with her, I go on any rides at theme parks with her and it’s horrible. I feel shame, I know I need to do something but I just can’t motivate myself to do anything. Has anyone ever known anyone this stupid and can anyone offer and advice? thank you

15,"Hi! I am new here and am looking to get help. I have been a night eater for MANY years (15-ish) and while I was in college it wasn't bad. Now (I feel) it is out of control. Sometimes I wake up and can't go back to sleep unless I eat. Sometimes I don't wake up at all until I drop a fork on the floor after I've eaten something. I am now considered obese. I feel like without this night eating thing, I can start to manage my weight. I am very concerned because of my family history of heart problems and diabetes. I don't know what to do about it. When I spoke to my physician about it, all he did was tell me, ""Well, it's a habit change."" I'm sure it is, but I need more to go on and much more support than ""It's your body, you deal with it."" Can anyone tell me options that I may have..a dietician? sleep study? Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. I need to lose all this weight that I gained.

16,"Sup, everyone. This'll be my first post.
So I've been struggling with binge eating since 2012 now, and decided to do something about it in 2017. It's never shown physically because I like to keep fit.
I went and got therapy and have been actioning the steps. They've worked for the most part, but it's so hard. Sometimes I won't even use them because the urge is so hard to get rid of. It's overwhelming. I have goals in life and fitness but in that moment, then and there, nothing else matters. I just want to be filled with food. In the following days, my productivity is at an all time low.
I'm trying so hard with the dealing with the urges, but they accumulate (e.g. I'll deal with them one day, then they'll come back stronger the next). I want to get out of this. I'm scared to let people outside my family/past therapists know, and I don't go out drinking with my friends because I'm terrified of gaining weight through excess calories. 
I've no idea what to do anymore. I just want to stop doing it. 
Bit deep, but that's the truth, lol.

I know this is not treatment, but am looking forward to talk to people on similar circumstances and hear advice and how you are dealing with it. I have a therapist and even having a deep trust in her I do not want to tell her about this since I dont feel comfortable with sharing any of this with her, since I am very concearned about not being able to go back to the US and continue college if I tell her.

18,"Hello all, 
This is my first post in this (or any) eating disorders-related forum or group. I'm a 29-year-old male (former competitive distance runner) who has struggled with a variety of eating disorders for close to the last decade. For me, disordered eating started with extreme caloric restriction for the first few years, followed by years of back and forth between binge eating and periods of restriction. At the present time, I'm dealing with what I know is a very unhealthy behavior pattern. As you might expect, those patters involve semi-frequent overexertion and injury. I've also developed an all-or-nothing mindset where I either am able to track everything I eat and hit my nutrition goals perfectly OR have very large binges. More often than not, I find myself ""staying on track"" during the workweek, then bingeing during the evenings of each weekend, often surpassing X calories on days of binges. 
Intellectually, I know I'm doing short and long term damage to my mind and body (which, at moments, is utterly terrifying), but I find myself cycling through periods of motivation and utter hopelessness and am at the point where I know I need outside help (in some way) to begin on the pathway toward some kind of recovery. Does anyone have thoughts or recommendations about where and how to start? My spouse has some idea of my challenges with food, but I've largely played down the fact that this is still a prominent issue in my life. Additionally, I'm not sure if I should consider some kind of out- or in-patient treatment, possible medications, or therapy. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!

19,"I have to say the least, a very unique situation. At some point along the line in my life, I've lost the ability to normally perceive hunger. Or maybe I've never had it to begin with, I cannot decide. A little bit of context may indicate some kind of answer to this: I have a physical disability known as Spina Bifida, of which spinal cord damages it has caused has lost some nerve functioning in the course of many incidents over the years. I've yet to act on this suspicion, if I even need to. I know fully well that this isn't normal, yet I don't see this to be a problem.
 Sure, I don't eat many snacks, and if left unattended I am at high risk of accidentally missing a meal(or two). However, it isn't like I don't feel the side effects of hunger;Usually when I am ""hungry"" and food is presented in front of me, I can gauge my hunger level by level of interest in food. Also, if I go without food long enough, I start to feel weak/faint and low energy. But, these are quite inconvenient and unconventional measures for hunger, and I am having second thoughts about them
So what do you all think? Is this as bad as part of me thinks it is? Any other thoughts?

20,"So last summer I went through a period where I suffered a lot of trauma and an inordinent amount of stress and anxiety which has caused me to have chronic tension headaches, acid reflux, and feeling of tightness in my throat. The feeling of tightness has gotten so bad to the point where it is very uncomfortable to eat anything solid. I have not eaten anything solid since last month. My last full meal was Halloween 2019. I have lost a lot of weight since August 2019 to now. Doctors have done a CT Scan, bloodwork, an upper endoscopy, and a Barrium Swallow Test and found nothing. Still do not know what is the matter, but we think it might be my body stuck in tense mode after being stressed out everyday for months. I have been drinking high protein to keep some nutrients in my body but I wonder if there are nutrition plans online that can educate me on how the body changes after long periods of starvation and what steps I can take to reaccustom my body gradually to solid food without making myself sick.

I was overweight as a child and compensated for that by being the class-clown amongst other forms of coping, i.e fashion in attempts to make me feel more confident -( which probably led to my love for the Arts).
In high school I restricted heavily. I called this portion control.
In highscool I achieved significant weightloss.
I gained confidence: Lead in musicals, marching band, choir, class president, homecoming King.
I also started a punk rock band.
Since graduating HS I've decided to pursue music as opposed to going to college, this, against the will/approval of my parents, teachers, and some peers.
Anxiety and depression hit hard.
A lot of parties.
A lot of jobs in customer service
Prescribed medication for anxiety
Multiple antidepressants off and on
Abused other medications to help me escape my anxiety and feel ok with my reality, it gave me confidence, diminished my self doubt.     This was my drug.
In and out of rehab for 4 yrs.
I don't take well to advice.
I had to do it myself.
Practically locked myself in a room.
I've been away from, ""clean"", off opiates ( the drug I can't control) for around 3 years now.
Gained a lot of weight back after sobriety.
This scared me sh**less
Confidence now completely gone
Anxiety in full gear
Sometimes I'd manically 'exercise' (walk miles until my feet hurt). I didn't see results.
I started a new diet.
Eventually this diet mixed with poverty has lead me to a new weight. I'm fine with this number.
But not with the mirror.
I obsess over my hair, have since puberty
I think my legs are fat, unproportional
Stomach rounded and pronounced
I sometimes I think im generally unattractive, the lines under my eyes, the way my mouth slopes downwards.
Times when I've changed my outfit 6 or 7 times before performing a show (still a musican, folk music now)
Times I've changed my outfit 6 or 7 times before going to the grocery store, to work, to the bar, to my parents house, to the park.
I feel I'm never satisfied with the way that I look and this huge lack of confidence has and is TAKING A TOLL on my everyday life. 
It's hard for me to express this to anybody because they don't believe me unless they know me well. I fear people will think that I'm just bullsh**ing for attention or something. I'm told I'm attractive, I've been with beautiful women, I'm popular in this small town, I'm a performer, I get on stage in front of people, sometimes a crowd, often times strangers. Why would they believe me?  
Thank you for reading my story.
It would be great to talk to anyone else who has gone or is going through anything somewhat similar
Advice would be wonderful
Feeling less alone would be wonderful
(And I'm not talking about AA or NA meetings or else I'd be on a different website or the basement of some church, I'm talking about men that struggle with thier self image)
Thank you

22,"Good day and Blessings to all. I have been dealing with emotional bingeing and purging. I used to beat myself up mentally with shame and regret. Now I am educating myself on the seriousness of this unhealthy coping cycle. I ceased my bingeing and purging episodes for a year or so until recently. As my grandmothers dementia worsen, family cohesion crashing, anxiety increases, and for some reason I have the worst negative thinking that does not seem to come from my heart but it's very judgemental. I start to feel drained mentally and even physically at times. B/P does not make it better as a way of coping. It will only deteriorate the mind body and soul. I understand that i have to fix the root of this cycle to heal completely. Pain is okay. Suppression is not. Understand that there are deeper consequences than emotional regret. The physical damage can be life threatening. My body needs me to get a grip and extract this demon. My mind needs me to free it from chains of regret. My soul needs me to nourish it with peace. I need me to Love My Existence more. We all do. Now let your healing begin

23,"Hello.  I am sorry you have been struggling for so long.  One thing is that we are not allowed to give out specific treatment center information.  But, we can offer support and help.  If I may, I was wondering why you have not let your wife know of how much you are struggling.  Do you think she suspects something, because even though I am not married, I would think that living with someone who is that close to you probably knows something isn't right and is afraid to bring it up or is waiting for you?  Do you think she is worried about you?  Does it affect your relationship do you think to have this kept from her?  I know these seem like very intrusive questions from a complete stranger. I struggled with eating disorders for most of my life. I am now getting a lot of relief although I still have some struggles.  I found it very difficult to hide from my parents.  Could never do it, they always somehow knew.  Still know when I am struggling even if I don't tell them.
If you are planning on going into long term treatment or a day program she will probably have to be told.  How would you feel about her knowing at that point?  Are you feeling shame for struggling?  Because this is not something you dreamt up and said, I want to have an eating disorder.  No. Life events caused you to turn to behaviors because that is what addictions do.  They serve a purpose and that is often to relieve internal pain that has never been dealt with.  
Have you ever seen a therapist for this?  NEDA can help you locate treatment providers in your area.  If you really think you need to go inpatient, they can help you find a place as well.  You may want to call different places to see the ratio of men to women and the average age.  It may be helpful information.  Also to know what type of therapy is used:  DBT  or CBT are the two most common.  Knowing how long they give you to finish your meals, if they allow you to select your meals or if they serve you.  Some places go on exchanges and allow you to menu plan, others just serve you and you eat what they serve.  But I am getting ahead of myself.  You first have to decide if you are going to therapy, or if you want to go into the hospital and then start therapy after.  I think if you go to your medical doctor and get checked out medically.  Let your doctor know what is going on.  If you are going to get help  you will probably need to start letting some people know, such as your medical doctor.  It may be scary or embarrassing, but we all struggle with something and shame should not factor into your getting help.  Eating disorders are life threatening and if you think it is out of control I urge you to seek some sort of help.
The type of insurance you have will also have an impact on what type of program you may be able to go to.   I know I just threw a lot of information at you.  Hope it wasn't too overwhelming.  I also hope it helped some.  You may never get to this point because you were upset by my initial questions, but I asked them because I have been dealing with the eating disorder a long time and understand family dynamics a lot.  I wasn't trying to be too personal.  You don't even have to answer them on the forum.  They are for you to think about.  So, if you want to, let us know how you are doing.  I'd like to here how you are.

24,"Hello there. First off, I am not a male, sorry.  But I have struggled with eating disorders for a long time.  I am now mostly in recovery.  You are correct in saying much more needs to be done to help males and seniors with eating disorders.  I know someone who is a senior who starting using alcohol to cope and another person said well, older people don't become alcoholics.  I was like...what?  Don't you know how high the rate of alcoholism is in the senior population.  I say that to let you know that people just don't realize that any age, any color, any gender, any economic back round or race do struggle with the same things.  Things like mental illness or eating disorders for staying on topic do not discriminate.  For so long, there were only females in treatment facilities.  For the most part this is still true today.  I am 52.  For a very long time as the eating disorder continued to rule my life, I was one of the oldest person in the program.  I felt terrible that I was such a bad influence for all the youngsters there that it was not good for me.  They really needed to separate the thirteen year old's from the adults as we have different life experiences and issues. For you not being able to find care in a mostly segregated society when it comes to the treatment of eating disorders, I am sorry.  Segregated in terms of programs not having specific help for men, and for older adults who usually start off young and never finding recovery, or having the eating disorder start late in life when life got really difficult.  
My hope for you is that things will change quicker than they are.  More awareness is occurring but not quick enough for those as you need help now.  Please feel free to post on the working toward recovery and maintaining recovery.  You may find more support there, even if it isn't always a man giving you the support. I don't know how you feel about that.  
My warmest wishes to you and please, keep posting and reaching out for support.
