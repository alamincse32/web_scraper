0,10/29/2021,BoneLossandRecoveryAssociatedwithAnorexia,"Hi,  Our daughter has been suffering from anorexia/orthorexia for approx 2 years now. Her weight dropped greatly and while she has recovered most of it back she is still in the grips of the disease. She has shown reduced bone density as exhibited in DEXA's done the past 2 years (3 done annually from July 19, 2019 - July 2021).  She also has a rare genetic affliction called Hypophosphatasia (HPP), which also can cause problems with bone density (although the symptoms shown by those suffering it vary widely from no symptoms to it being fatal in infants). I also have the disease and have never shown any signs of bone loss.  So, before blaming any bone loss on the HPP (and being resigned to a treatment regimen we are not in favor of) we are trying to get some specific information on bone loss and recovery associated with anorexia. My questions are 1) how long after the onset of anorexia does bone loss begin to be evident, 2) how long after gaining the weight lost by anorexia (i.e., back to the pre-anorexia weight) is it before the bone loss is reversed, and 3) how long would it take to get back to pre-anorexia density (if that is even possible)?  We have seen doctors, therapists, dietitians, etc., and I am not convinced that any of them really know these answers, and the easy way out is to simply agree with the geneticist who she is seeing for the HPP who simply blames it on the HPP and appears overly anxious to get my daughter into a study using this fairly new drug because there are so few patients in her category (as the disease is so rare).  Does anyone have any knowledge about this, or know where we could look?  Are any relevant reference works available? Some objective statistics would be great, but any thoughts anyone might have are welcome. I feel like just seeing another doctor isn't the answer.  Thanks! ",,,,,,,
1,10/21/2021,Daughterstrugglingincurrenttreatment,"Hello.  This is my first post.  My teenage daughter has been in a residential center only for a few days before they recommended she needed to go to a hospital for a feeding tube (via nose).  even though she was only at that center for 4 full days, she didn't eat any of her meals and barely drank water or supplemental drinks.  She's been bounced around with different therapists up to this point and residential was recommended as we tried virtual and that was not effective. I want her to go back to the residential because I feel consistency is key.  right now the dr's at hospital are focusing on her meds so she can be released and those thoughts go away.  You see my daughter's body image is distorted big time.  I want her to eat, she's still given meals at the hospital and she has been drinking her supplements but get the feeding through the tube at night as well.  I'm so worried and frustrated with doctors and the process.  I'm exhausted and wish there was something I could say so she knows that she will die if she doesn't eat.  She keeps saying she is okay but she isn't, I mean she's in a hospital. anyway here have experience with a child that had to have the feeding tube and how they came about removing it and finally eating?  I just want to hear from another parent...I'm alone.  Thank you so much.","One thing to remember about EDs is that people in your daughters position are going to be feeling that nobody really gets it about why she has to starve.  Because she does feel like she has to, or else…something bad is going to happen.  ""She'll get fat"" is her main concern, but ""getting fat"" is a stand-in for all sorts of other worries she has.  Plus she feels in control when she restricts, and feeling in control is a huge part of eating disorders.
So go to the hospital and they're going to force you to do every single thing that feels totally wrong to you.  Which is how you see recovery to be - you lose all of your sense of control, and everything that other people are going to try and force you to do feels absolutely wrong. Which who among us ever feels comfortable with that idea ?  No one that I know.
The folks at the treatment center aren't set up to deal with people who may be dying because they won't eat.  Imagine their legal situation if one of their clients died while they were supposedly taking care of them. So you can see why they'd want to ship someone off to the hospital in order to medically move them away from that possibility.
Having said all that, I can pretty much promise you that there's a part of your daughter that understands that she might be in trouble.  Sure, she still may want to push forward with her ED, and continues to view it as a positive thing.  But there's going to be another part of her that knows that it's not.  For one thing, just look at all the disruption it's caused for her, and the worry and concern that it causes for others. There's no way to spin any of that in a positive direction.
What it's going to take to turn things around is hard to say.  Guilt-tripping her is not going to help her feel better about herself, and the war-of-wills thing which can happen in treatment can be problematic as well.
So you'll have to see.  Her own decisions about things is what will make the ultimate difference. Rather than decisions that others try and impose on her.
Having said all that, the idea that you as her parent, would be open to hearing her real feelings in a sympathetic and non-judgmental way…that may help her feel more at ease.
Which people with EDs generally don't feel at ease in the least, so anything you can do along those lines is likely to work in her favor.
In any case, wishing the best for all of you. With EDs, when things are at this stage, it's rare that anyone feels good about anything, so try and keep a level head if you can, and see what you can do to take the moment-to-moment sorts of things in stride.",,,,,,
2,10/10/2021,extremelyanxiousdaughter,"Hi. I have an adult daughter who is extremely anxious about food (has been since she launched). She is anxious in general but worrying about food often keeps her from eating. Recently she confessed that she sometimes binge eats and feels she can't stop. She spoke as though this was a few years ago, but I didn't press. She has digestive problems and was put on an elimination diet by her doctor. Perhaps it helped a little bit, not much. But now she seems even more anxious about food and eating. I'm not sure if this is an eating disorder or not. To complicate things, she married about a year ago to a young guy who is a very bad example. He is still eating like you would expect a college kid to eat, any random thing that looks good, lots of junk food in the house, orders food delivered as his supper. Her anxiety has transferred to him and she's mad at him all the time. She seems unable to talk to him past a very superficial level. When I urge her to explain things to him she becomes hysterical. She is also always tired and seems depressed but she denies she is depressed.I don't even know where to start. I want to cook for her so she has healthy foods in the house that won't cause her the extreme constipation she sometimes suffers from. And also to relieve her  of worrying about being able to eat well enough. Her husband does not want me involved. He says he will take care of things but he absolutely does not. For example, he was going to make lunch for them today (there is very little in the house to eat except junk) but he watched the football game instead. I picked her up and took her to the grocery store and got her to choose some ready made foods that were not junk food. It was expensive but it will get her through the week.If I cook for her, it will cost much less and be more healthy. Am I wrong to do this? This downward spiral has been going on for over a year and I have watched her mental health deteriorating and am starting to get concerned about her physical health.She will be going to an EAP counselor in a couple of weeks. She gets 10 visits for free. I'm not sure what happens after that. In the past she has not been honest with counselors, so I don't know what will happen this time. I am in a lot of distress watching her deteriorate.",,,,,,,
3,10/07/2021,"We’renewtothesubject,lookingforadvice","My wife and I learned of this disorder just a few months ago, and our daughter is in a 6 week daily program that she seems to like. She came to us for help, and has acknowledged her dis-association with food along with other anxieties and stresses for some time.The center she is at never surveyed us for family history, but they did require her doctor to sign off. She is upfront, vocal, honest in her desire to get better, and does not (apparently) have other related symptoms such as body image issues, AR or BR,etc. . In addition, heavy marijuana use over the past few years has led us to research Hyperemesis.The big picture question I have is this- how to know if an eating disorder was diagnosed correctly, vs. just an additional symptom of her anxiety? In other words, do we spend energy and resources focusing on ED or a more whole body/ holistic approach to identify possible alternative root causes?Thank you in advance.",,,,,,,
4,10/03/2021,Managingthestagesofrecoveryandwhattostay,"My daughter (20yrs)is on the recovery journey from anorexia. Following a hospital stay she is now home and has put on weight. She now has moments where in her words she binges and also feels she is always hungry. Apparently this can happen - can it??  She now really hates/ is utterly disgusted with how she looks and thinks she is overweight ( which she isn’t) She is so tired of trying to recover and it’s heartbreaking to see her so distressed and disgusted with herself. I understand this is another stage of recovery but whatever we try to do to encourage and support her to keep going just doesn’t resonate and she has a negative response to whatever we say. . She has a psychologist she meets once a week - I have encouraged her to have more sessions as I feel she needs more professional help to help her through this current stage. We also try distraction activities but she’s also  scathing about thisAny others tips/advice that we can use?

5,09/08/2021,Nutritionist,My daughter and I saw a nutritionist for her eating disorder today and we left feeling underwhelmed. The nutritionist seemed very much like a therapist and my daughter is already seeing a therapist for her eating disorders. We were both expecting more of a clear plan on what she should be eating to restore a healthy weight. Does anyone have any experience with nutritionist and what role they provide.,"Maybe the ED therapist has some other nutritionists to recommend? Nutritionists are like therapists, won't always mesh with them and have to shop around for one you like. My friend tried out 3 different nutritionists before she found one that she liked. t couldn't hurt to let the nutritionist know that you would like to hear a plan for restoring a healthy weight",,,,,,
6,07/29/2021,Gaggingduringrecovery,"Has anyone experienced their child starting to gag through meals after being weight restored?  She was not purging prior and did not have this symptom through an intense recessing period of several months.  It started about 6 weeks ago after she was meal compliant and weight restored and period returned.  It is quite random (could be breakfast, snack dinner etc) and she sometimes will even vomit partly on her plate if it gets really bad.
Nothing medically wrong and appears to get worse if anxious but sometimes she says it’s totally random and unexpected.  Would love to know if anyone has found a way to ease/get through this.  I’m fairly certain it’s just ED fighting back in another way but We’re kind of stuck.",My daughter is dealing with this now.  It just started about a month ago after 3 months of progress and weight restoration.  It seems to affect her just in the morning.  She started using medication to control the nausea when it happens.  It does seem to help but can't understand why it started and can't get an answer from providers other than anxiety.,,,,,,
7,09/20/2021,Financesoftreatment,"Hello, I am somewhat new at navigating the world of eating disorders.  I have a 19 year old daughter who started with outpatient (RD and therapist) this summer.  She was making good progress but then went back to college and has been struggling.  There have been conflicting/differing recommendations from her team and it seems likely a higher level of care will ultimately be recommended as we sort things out over the next few days/weeks.  I have been in touch with a treatment facility who offers residential, IOP and PHP.  I am having absolute sticker shock about the cost of treatment after insurance covers.  And I'm blown away by how many people state their children have done programs multiple times. How do people afford this?  Do they go bankrupt?  Mortgage their homes?  I'm really struggling with this aspect- especially with such low success and relapse rates.  I am considering making her spend every dime in her savings account on her own treatment- would that be more motivation?  Would love thoughts and input about this.",,,,,,,
8,10/04/2020,"adultdaughtersuffersfromED,refusestreatment,doesnotliveathome","Hi there, My 26-year-old daughter has developed a SEVERE eating disorder. She is wasting away and completely convinced that she is eating ""healthily,"" and that I'm completely wrong about this. There are issues regarding our family:-she lives in my mother's house (not with me nor my husband)
-she is not motivated to look for a job or interact with anyone who can tell her that she looks visibly ill
-she does not trust me, my husband, nor my youngest daughter (who had an ED 7 years ago).My daughter and I do communicate and if there's something bothering her tremendously, she does ask for my opinion. But she is extremely stubborn and is convinced that she's always correct, and my mother reinforces that. The people around her enable her and COVID has made things much worse. She is completely isolated from any level-headed person who might give an objective opinion on this. She refuses to see a doctor. I have asked her many times to at least go and get a check-up or blood test, but she refuses. Her doctor does not understand EDs and will reinforce what she's doing as ""healthy"" as well, even if she would go and see him.My daughter looks like she is about to collapse at any second. I am extremely worried. I am desperate for help with this situation and any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for listening.","Hi daisyladybug – welcome to the forums.

Your description of her condition is concerning, so we wanted to make sure to provide a list of signs and symptoms to look out for. The following are just some of the signs of a serious problem that demands immediate medical attention:If she experiences anything above, we highly recommend seeking help from a medical professional as soon as possible. Seek medical help soon on an outpatient basis if she: The NEDA Helpline can help put you in contact with treatment and support options available to your daughter, and we recommend reaching out. You can reach the Helpline at 800.931.2237 M-Th 11am-9pm ET and F 11am-5pm ET or you can chat with us online M-Th 9am-9pm ET and F 9am-5pm ET. We hope it can be of help. Wishing you, your daughter and your family well, and please take care.","Dear Mom,I found out about this site today, while reaching out for support to help me deal with my daughter's death two months ago. I am devastated, and will never forgive myself for not learning more about this terrible illness. If I had known, now,  what I recently learned (over the past 8 months) I am sure she would still be alive. (She would definitely be struggling and the road to recovery would have been a difficult two years - if not longer - but she would be alive. I miss her every minute of every day. We were so, so close; until the last 8-9 months.  We fought, she lied, she hid the laxatives, and made promises that she never intended to keep.  Her brain had deteriorated, due to malnourishment, and her eating disorder became a severe mental illness. I was told, over and over, that she would die if she did not receive the help she needed; yet, the hospitals did not provide her with the help she needed. Our system is broken and anorexia is different for each person. There is no one way to treat it. (This is why we have so much difficulty helping anorexics.)I would suggest that you start reading articles and watching videos about this disease. You should read the book X.  EVERY doctor, nurse, and parent of an anorexic should read this book to understand the progression of this illness. (Obviously, family dynamics will differ from each family, but the way the main character deals with her anorexia will definitely send chills up your spine because you will relate to her behavior.While reading this book, you could share it with your mother, since you daughter is living with her. Somehow, you should try to make your mother understand that if something happens to your daughter she might feel guilty. You, your husband, and your mother should try to work together to develop a plan. Since your daughter is living with your mother, and you mentioned she is not working - it seems she is dependent upon your mother for shelter and food. If this is the case, ALL 3 of you need to develop a plan to get her some help. I hope your daughter either has some type of health care. If not, see what medical benefits she is entitled to and reach out and help her get what she can get. THEN, all three of you must sit down with your daughter and discuss how concerned you are, etc. Remember, the most difficult part is to remain calm. (My husband and I had handled all of this the wrong way - we were way too emotional - I didn't know how to handle it back then. Her behavior caused us so much stress. After her two severe hospitalizations in Aug. and Oct of 2019, we yelled at her all the time. Her behavior was so erratic and strange.  I later learned from the therapist who saw my daughter one time (and this therapist admitted telling my daughter that if she didn't leave our home, living with us would kill her!)before my daughter packed her bags and moved where no one could see her and led a life of lies about how she was gaining weight, etc. Remember, anorexics can be extremely smart, manipulative, and liars. COVID is the worst environment for anorexics.What I am trying to say, is that you need a plan of action of how you can get her to do what you want her to do so she can get the help she needs. (A few months after my daughter moved, my husband and I decided to try and lure her a promise of a studio apartment near my son's condo if she gained weight and kept it on for 3 months. She promised this and kept telling us she was gaining her weight.  We wanted her to reach a higher weight. When she left for Chicago she was under that weight. When I reached her place in Chicago, she weighed even less!)I think a problem parents face is being too emotionally involved.  We love our kids and will do anything for them, and I kept believing my daughter's lies. I wish I had read that book last year. I wish so many things.  (Ironically, I found this book among my daughter's things when cleaning her room.)I hope this helps you. Anorexia is a deadly disease and it takes a lot of strength to help those affected by it. I kept thinking that my daughter was old enough to decide if she wanted to gain weight or not, but it isn't that easy. Because anorexia is both physical and mental, both types of treatment are needed for success. It is so difficult for anorexics who are 18 years or older to go for help. We pleaded with our daughter for 8 years. It only became worse.I hope you are able to take away some advice from my response. I will be thinking of you.","I hope the forums have been providing some support for you. I’m sorry to hear about your daughter; seeing a child struggle with disordered eating isn’t easy and it shows how strong and caring you are to reach out and ask for help. I see that you’ve already received some really good advice from others, but I also wanted to add that not everyone’s road to recovery is the same. As mentioned above, the NEDA helpline can help you find support options that can determine the best course of action that suits your daugher personally. Navigating this situation may be difficult but remember, recovery is possible. I hope you and your daughter are able to stay safe and take care.","Looking for a forum or blog to join parents discussing what help and other resources available to me as my daughter has agreed she has a dysmorphic image of herself. She is below the 8th % for weight in girls her age. She came home for a short visit from college and is at lowest weight ever but describes her self as puffy of fat after eating quite often
Suggestions","Interesting post and perspective. I agree with much of it. I have to wonder how healthy it is to only focus on the negative aspects of the relationship though. I realize that emotions are powerful but my personal feelings and perspective changed when I accepted my own failures without laying blame and acknowledge the positive things my parents did do when I was growing up. They are both deceased now and I wish that things had been better when they were alive but none of us could seem to get beyond the emotional fog of the past. I think this is what forgiveness feels like. I guess I'm saying that I accept things as they are. They did the best they could even though it wasn't what I needed and I have failed at times and those failures lay squarely on my shoulders. I'm not naive, I do realize that there are varying degrees of toxicity and some people will not change but I have to wonder if our only real power lays in our ability to empathize and forgive. just a thought.","It is so hard to read all of these posts.  My daughter has suffered with disordered eating for many years and it has been a daily battle.  We have dealt with the lowest of the lows, thoughts of suicide, self-harm, feelings of hopelessness, feeling worthless, serious medical complications.  You name it, we've been through it.  My heart goes out to every parent who is trying to keep their child going one day at a time.  We went to treatment centers, therapists, nutritionists and nothing worked.  If anything, working with ""specialists"" made her more resentful and made her dig her heels in more.  What worked for her was getting to the point where she had such alarming chest pain that it scared her so bad that she wanted to turn her life around.  She no longer wanted to live like this.  Having said this, she was full of disdain for ""trained professionals"" who had no idea how she was feeling or what she was going through.  She sought out people who shared their story online who had beaten this dreadful disease so they knew exactly what she was going through.  In her mind, they were the experts.  I would say she has been trying to recover for about two years now.  And as hard as it is to live with someone with an eating disorder, the recovery journey is just as hard, if not harder for the person suffering with the disease.  This is where she gets comfort from learning from people who have been through this.  My daughter is sharing her experience online now because she wants other people suffering with this disease to know that they are not alone.  She gets messages from people who say ""I ate dinner tonight because of you,"" or ""I am one month into recovery and I am following your progress and you are what keeps me going.""  Maybe try and steer your daughter towards finding someone who she can relate to who has turned her life around.  It has been a long road, X lbs of weight gain but my daughter looks amazing and healthy.  She said this morning for the first time, ""you know, I actually don't hate my body anymore.""  She has been weight-restored for a while but we are seeing signs of the neural re-wiring in the brain.  I wanted to cry when she said that this morning.  It doesn't happen overnight, we had a few relapses and we never ever thought we would see her recover but I think the recovery process is plateauing and we are about to enter the downhill phase.  She is excited for the rest of her life but she wants to make sure she sees this through to the finish line.  Good luck to you all.  Recovery is possible.","Hi, thank you for sharing!

14,06/25/2021,AdultDaughterSufferingFromFoodAvoidanceED,"My 24 year old daughter, who has lived in another state for the past four years, has returned home with a relapse of anorexia, taking the form of food avoidance and texture issues. In the past, she has been treated for anxiety and depression, with both medication and therapy. She left home to attend school, living with boyfriend. Her relationship (thankfully) ended and she lived on her own for some time, then quit attending school without informing us (she was in a cosmetology program), so all the money we had invested was gone. She began a new relationship, which seemed great, made a single semester stab at college, then moved to another state with boyfriend. The relapse with food issues began off/on last summer, after she had been prescribed a medication for depression/anxiety. She read this medication also can suppress your appetite, so she discontinued it and therapy. Things have gone downhill from there. Her relationship has deteriorated, not only due to her issues, but her boyfriend's controlling and verbally abusive behavior, which really intensified her eating problems. I finally told her to leave and come back to our home, as that was clearly a toxic environment for her. She's been here two weeks. She has always been on the slender size, but is currently less than her normal weight.. She does not NOT eat, but she says at times she'll spend a long time just trying to get herself to eat something. If I cook a meal, she'll eat it. She doesn't purge, she sees her body clearly as it is. We are looking at the best way to get her treatment now and residential seems out of reach financially, even with insurance. We're trying to find counselors to treat her, but she keeps rejecting everyone because she says (based on online info) that they don't have experience with her specific type of ED. On top of all this, she's floundering in terms of knowing what she wants to do with her life in terms of career, boyfriend will not leave her alone, she's conflicted about the relationship - basically, a ton of bricks. I'm unsure of how to move forward with her. She's welcome to stay in our home and receive treatment here, but past issues have made us impatient with her. In the past, she's gone through psychiatric treatment and therapy and didn't following through with it. The ED in the past seemed to be a component of anxiety problems and was helped by treatment for that. She was put into an involuntary psychiatric hold after cutting herself so badly it required a trip to hospital for treatment. That was a nightmare that did more harm than good. She no longer cuts. To add to this, I have a very elderly parent who is requiring more care, a husband who is on dialysis for kidney failure and another child with substance abuse issues. I am a little uninformed about this type of ED as it is not what I have heard about in the past and feel overwhelmed. My daughter is willing and anxious to get treatment, but her past behavior has made me expect she won't follow through with it. I'm overwhelmed and unsure how to find the right treatment that is affordable and accessible. Any advice is welcome. Thanks for listening to my rambling!!","Hi August41, welcome to the forums!

Any suggestions on other programs we can look into in the area?","Hi leftybanks, welcome to the forums! The NEDA Community Guidelines do not allow discussion of specific treatment centers on the forums, but we encourage you to reach out to the NEDA Helpline to discuss programs that you can look into for your daughter. The NEDA Confidential Helpline can be reached at 800.931.2237 (M-TH 11am-9pm ET, F 11am-5pm ET) or use the NEDA Online Chat  Monday to Thursday 9am to 9pm and Friday 9am to 5pm. Please don’t hesitate to reach out!",,,,,,
16,04/05/2021,Daughterinresidential.Possiblein-patientsoon,"Hello All,Our daughter is in residential treatment and am currently waiting word if she has to go to in patient at a hospital due to her not eating all of her meals. I'll be asking the facility but is this normal? Does this happen to a lot of patients once entered into a facility? She was just brought in last Thursday. Again, I'll be asking these and other questions to the facility but it's also good to ask questions on a forum for more support. This whole thing stinks and it's breaking my heart to see our daughter go through this. We see her on zoom meetings and she's not doing very well at this time. Thanks.",,,,,,,
17,03/17/2021,Howtomanageuntilresidential,"Hello,
I am new to this and trying to figure out how to manage.  My daughter is 12 and has anorexia.  Her ED therapist has recommended residential treatment, as my daughter is really struggling.  It seems we may be on a 4 to 6 week wait to get her into a center, and I am terrified we won't be able to manage keeping her going that long on a basic survival kind-of basis.  Has anyone else had to wait for residential for a long period of time? How did you do it? I feel like her rapid physical deterioration cannot be managed for too long.",,,,,,,
