2,04/03/2020,losingsenseofsmellandtasteandrecovery,"Hi,
I've been doing really well and being really motivated in recovery (anorexia) but lost the sense of smell and taste two days ago and feel awful. I'm struggling to cope and struggling to keep eating, which I suspect is probably due to the virus although I don't have any other major symptom aside from headache and fatigue. My dad and sister also lost the sense of smell but had more significant symptoms (fever that lasts and cough) which is why I suspect the virus. Does anyone have advice regarding loss of taste and smell and avoiding relapse ?","Ugh, sorry to hear your family is dealing with this.  And yes, with people who have the mildest symptoms, the taste and smell thing can often be all that they notice.But really, anyone who is ill might have problems with their appetite, so I hope you won't get too down on yourself if you are not feeling like eating.  You know how it goes with EDs I'm sure - one of the symptoms seems to be how people can get down on themselves for all sorts of different and frequently undeserved reasons.  If you are ill, and have family members to worry about too, yeah; any normal person might not find themselves all that hungry, just as a natural thing. So for now, I hope you can allow that to just be how things are, rather than some sort of poor reflection on yourself. Hoping you all start feeling better soon.  It's an anxious time for everyone, that's for sure, but if you guys get safely past this, you'll be among the fortunate ones who no longer have to be paranoid about getting it.  xx","Hi jujugreen, We understand the frustrations and fears during the time of  COVID-19 and know it can be difficult.

3,08/21/2020,HomewithTriggers,"So I lost my job due to COVID and came home to wait it out. Cut to six months later and I'm still home. I put on some weight and got back into my exercise routine that helps keep me balanced so I was able to drop the weight. Just now (it's about midnight) I microwaved some leftovers from earlier to eat. My mom stopped me and said I shouldn't be eating this late. Which sure, it's probably not the best for my digestion or my sleep but I was hungry and wanted to eat. So instead of following my impulse to throw the food away, I ate it because I wanted to. I then went back and asked her not to comment on when or what I eat. She said it's her job as my mother to educate me. We went back and forth for a bit. I said I was an adult and can make a decision on when to eat on my own. she said I need to learn when to eat and that she's my mother and has the right to say something. I know she means well but my ED kicks in and I feel worthless. I feel like I have failed because I ate late. And I feel like purging. I won't but there's a feeling in the pit of my stomach making me want to. I even thought about trying somethings else. Anyone else having to now live at home with things or people that trigger them?","Hi scottgirl20,I am sorry to hear things are rough right now, and that you have been feeling triggered. I have had some similar experiences begin home with COVID and trying to avoid the topic of weight  and food with family. Its hard not to let it get to you even when someone means well. Just remember that you have every right to let your family know that certain things can be upsetting, and you would prefer that they avoid these topics, if that is something you feel comfortable doing. No matter what, everyone on the forums is here for you! And you can always use the help line when you need. Sending love and hugs.","Hi, I’m sorry about your job and that your mom crossed your boundaries like that. Like jess64 said, you have every right to tell her not to comment on what/when you eat and as someone recovering from ED, that’s so important. But again, I’m sorry your mom hasn’t been respectful of that. I also wanted to congratulate you for eating the food because you were hungry even when your ED thoughts AND your mom told you not to. That is a huge step and you should be proud of yourself, because I know how hard that is. I hope things get better with your mom and recovery, you deserve it. Also, if you don’t already, I’d recommend seeking professional support in the form of a therapist, dietician, etc. if that’s an option for you. Hope you’re well!","triggers me. It's a constant battle between my sensible conscious mind and my subconscious mind (which behaves like a 9 or 10,yr old) and cares nothing about my painful history or consequences of my (grazing) style binge eating. Out of my home I'm in charge. Even with my life partner here makes no difference.. CC","My dad triggers me all the time thankfully I don't live with him but u see him a lot and obviously we talk when not in person, he comments on my weight and food intake all the time and it makes me feel like poop","Scottgirls20, wow. I feel like I'm right there with you! Family can be the hardest to deal with sometimes... I just want to affirm you and state that you are NOT worthless and you're brave even just for sharing this with us! You are not a failure because you ate late or because you haven't found a job yet. We are in some pretty unpside-down times and a good chunk of a generation of kids are home during a time of their lives when they actually need to be OUT of the home and independent in many things. Be careful not to let someone else's opinion about your decision to healthfully feed yourself cause you to feel like you made a wrong decision! Continue to stay strong and resist those urges to engage in certain behaviors that disrupt our body's natural state–I believe in you! There are absolutely boundaries that you can place around certain topic matters and home-situations that you and your family run in to. You have agency and authority! It has been difficult for me too. I eat secretly and have kept it a secret for quite some time now... tough interactions with my family or my girlfriend (I am a guy!) cause me to turn to the wrong things to help me feel comforted. The people closest to us tend to have a pretty powerful affect on our lives. What helps me stay on the offense against my non-normal eating behaviors is reminding myself how much BETTER of person I am to others and to myself when I choose to set aside these behaviors. I feel like I'm able to care for my family better when I am not turning to food to fill fill/numb me. I feel like I have more capacity for love when I think about how I can best serve those around me before I turn to satisfy an unhealthy desire. What do you remind yourself of when you feel urges coming on? You got this!",,,,,
4,08/11/2020,hadtogettested--feellikeeveryonehatesme,"So, one of my eating disorder triggers is feeling like people are mad at me. I know, it's ridiculous and I had been working on it over the years with a lot of success actually. But covid screwed it all up. I already was feeling the collective anger in the air, so to speak and struggling with being made fun of for wearing a mask by some of the more ignorant folks around. But now, I have returned to work out of necessity. (We opened and I'm a single parent. I have to work). I ended up in contact with someone who was showing symptoms of the virus and I had to get tested and quarantine until I got the results. It was negative for me. (The person with symptoms still does not have her results). And now, I just feel like everyone is mad at me. My employer was being mean about it until I explained my living situation. I live with my young son and my parents. But until then, they didn't even understand why I would get tested unless the other person's results came back positive. I can't wait who knows how long until she gets her results to even get a test! My family would have (rightfully) made me self-quarantine until I knew. So, I had to pay out of pocket for the test to get it right away as going through my doctor was going to take too long.
Anyway, once I got the results, my family was happy but my parents seem mad at me. Like it looks like they are disgusted with me, based on their facial expressions. I've asked if they are angry and they said no, but they scoffed and said it really dismissively. Now I have to got back to work tonight and I can't stop thinking that my boss and coworkers have been making fun of me for even getting a test at all.
I just really need some encouragement and maybe a way to stop these thoughts. Thanks everyone.
-Cat","hi catdragonfly,I could have written the post you just did. One of my greatest fears is that people will be angry at me, that nothing I do will please them, that simply by virtue of me being me I am ""wrong"". Please take comfort, if you can, and the very strong probability that this is anorexic thinking. It's delusional.I'm 71 years old, I've been battling this disease ever since puberty, and I've been hearing that voice all those years. Sometimes it overwhelms me. Covid has handed it a megaphone. It yells and yells and yells and yells. It takes everything I have to send it to its timeout chair. It always comes back.Covid should not be stigmatizing, but we are a society that stigmatizes as if it were a reflex. You're very wise to get yourself tested, especially given that you are caring for a child on your own. If you live in a part of country that scoffs at face masks, I am so very sorry. You are being socially responsible, compassionate, and mindful of others. Everybody should be wearing a mask in reciprocity. Everybody. We have been cooped up for five months. You're right. People are mad. The air is full of anger. You're not imagining it. But it's not about you. Not one bit. If someone loses it with you, almost none of their rage has anything to do with you. I know that's hard to hold onto.It's happened to me, too. I look vulnerable because I'm so thin. No matter what I do, how I dress, what makeup I wear or don't, how I walk, I'm a target. If someone wants to lose their s***, I never look like I can defend myself. (I'm practicing this.) I wish I could protect you. I wish somebody could protect me. But sometimes we are all just out there in a world that seems aimed at us. But the important word is ""seems"". There is no real target. That's what's so hard about all this free-floating rage we've pent up since the lockdown. You have dignity. You are decent and humble. You have wonderful things about you that no one can ever take away from you.Please be good to you.-Grieving","This proud NEW YORKER says THANK YOU for getting tested and being responsible and wearing a mask. I am so sorry anyone would give you a hard time about ANY of this. And if it makes you feel better, everyone and their mother in NYC has gotten a test (or have been tested multiple times), there is ZERO stigma at all - I hope it starts to maybe feel more like that wherever you are. <3, STP","It is a really tough time for a lot of people right now and it sounds like you are just doing what needs to be done in order to get by and make your life work. IF your family and boss are mad at you, it seems unjustified, but it could be that they are not and you're just finding ways to make their reactions feel like anger directed at you. I'm not at all saying this to be dismissive or mean because I have done the same thing many times. I have learned though that sometimes I turn self loathing/ anger into something I project onto others. Perhaps nobody is actually mad at you, but you are stressed and upset and making yourself feel like they are?
I'm glad you explained your situation to your boss-- it sounds like there was some grace given once there was some understanding.
I hope everything is settling down for you and that you are feeling more positive.
Good luck.","Hi Cat, I'm so sorry you had to go through this! The collective anger in the air – I feel it too (so much tension in society right now) and it's definitely hard. Don't forget the progress you've made working on your ED trigger of feeling like people are mad at you. It's still progress, despite the current pandemic making everything harder.I've tried to use this time to work on my confidence and self-trust by wearing my mask, social distancing and setting boundaries. I know it's easier said than done and I'm lucky to live in a state where mask shaming is a bit less common, since masks are required to enter stores and even to visit more mainstream parks, but wearing your mask is a sign of strength. Anyone who would make fun of it is showing you their own issues and insecurities and should really work on themselves.Not only was it smart for you to get tested, it seems negligent for your company not to require it (certainly negligent for your employer to be mean to you about it). You don't deserve to have to put up with that. You even protected your employer/their business by getting tested! I don't know why your parents would be mad but I'm very sorry if that's the case. Sometimes I think people are mad at me when they aren't, but I don't know your parents, and I don't want to invalidate your experience by any means. No one in their right mind would ever make fun of you though. It's very normalized here and I even know some people who are happy to hear others take precautions, because they didn't speak up themselves but they wanted to.My aunt just got a positive test yesterday, my uncle may very well have it, my cousin, and my sister-in-law's family had it. My best friend's grandmother was elderly but otherwise healthy and passed away from it when she likely would have lived another 5+ years if it weren't for the virus. I know someone young and healthy who had it in May and still doesn't have her lung capacity back, while her husband had it and is totally fine. The thing is, we don't know right now. We don't know how it'll affect each individual and it's stupid not to take precautions.","Covid-19 has had a deep impact upon many of our lives.  One of the main negative elements of the Covid pandemic is the fact that people with eating disorders and other psychological related issues have found themselves very much alone due to the lockdowns.
  Your post raises a lot of points regarding how you are feeling - not just right now - but also with your life-long battle with eating disorder.
   There's nothing to feel ashamed about wearing a mask as you are caring for a child.  Sharing a living space will increase the risk of viruses spreading, so caution is advised.
   The 'collective anger' that you were feeling will have been caused by the strict rules and regulations.  This will create a quiet build-up of discontent and repressed anger.
   Being a person sensitive to facial expressions, you may find the wearing of masks by others in the street as intimidating.  No reassurance over the facial expressions....No potential warnings regarding facial expressions....
  No warmth, smiles, frowns or joy....Just a blank outline of a face.  Certainly not good for anyone who experiences heightened sensitivity to people, or needs constant reassurance of facial recognition.
   The colleague displaying the symptoms of coronavirus should not be attending work.
   Anyone who is unwell should really be sent home with immediate effect.  Even with just a 'sniffle'.  In 'normal times' it wouldn't have mattered.....
  Your employer will be feeling the strain caused by this outbreak and will come over as not being very compassionate.  At least they did show some understanding when you explained your circumstances.
  You are a person who is very sensitive to how others may feel about you.
  Someone in your situation will be experiencing not only the physical elements of your eating disorder and its 'triggers' but also the psychological impact as well.  Eating disorders and psychological issues go hand-in-hand.
  Your feelings about other people could well be connected to your eating disorder because the physical elements of the condition may be the cause of your anxiety.
  This can be likened to someone with food allergies or conditions that can trigger sudden mood changes in people after eating the wrong food or not eating properly.  Anxiety, guilt and sensitivity to other people can also arise because of your eating disorder.
  You may feel that everyone is mad at you.  However.  This anger is very unlikely to be because of you.
  Coronavirus is a purely physical virus that is transmitted via close contact - it spreads from person to person and can cause us to become very ill.
  Although a physical illness, much psychological damage has been caused.  There will be many untold stories caused by this outbreak.  The business damage, financial damage, the personal damage.
  Sadly.  All around you, people have been touched by the virus....
  From your own perspective, try not to blame yourself for how others may be feeling.  This isn't your fault.
  Where your home life is concerned, try giving each other some space and avoid trivial domestic arguments such as who should do the vacuuming or washing-up.
  Your personal life journey has made you sensitive to others and resulted in you dealing with an eating disorder.  The psychological effects, as well as the physical effects will cause your anxiety and sensitivity.
   You may find it helpful to explore your feelings with a counsellor as this will help you to deal with these sensitive feelings concerning other people.  You may also benefit from exploring your issues surrounding (and the causes) of your eating disorder.
  Counselling can help you to explore your life journey and address issues that are causing your feelings of anxiety around people.  This could also be part of why you are dealing with an eating disorder.
  Eating disorders can start unseen (likely from very early childhood), over a period of many years.   People don't see the problem coming - and when they do - they become skilled at hiding it.
  It's a hard thing to discuss and to face, but you do spend a lot of time and energy worrying about what others think and feel about you.
  There are times in life when you need to focus on your own objectives and put to one side what others may be thinking.  If your colleagues are genuinely angry (collective or otherwise) with you at work, then so be it.  You were doing what you felt was right for you, your colleagues, family and your child.
  Unfortunately.  The reality is - whatever the propaganda brought to you by the media -   people are not going to change because of this.  People will still feel the same way about life and will find someone or something else to get upset over.
  It's no point burdening yourself with their negative attitudes because you have your own issues to deal with.
  This is a life-changing period for us all.  Use this as an opportunity to focus on what you want, what you need to do to achieve your goals and not worry about what others may be thinking.",,,,,

6,08/07/2020,OlderAnorexicTriggeredbyPandemic,"Hi,I'm here because I don't know where else to go. I'm 71 years old, there are people who love me, and I'm in a very good 12 step program. My therapist is very concerned about me. I simply don't want to sound like a broken record, or take my distress someplace where it isn't welcome.I have been at a low weight for years, but my doctor has considered me healthy. When the pandemic hit, all the medical offices closed up and I could no longer go in for weight checks. Then my stress levels skyrocketed, I was injured in a bad fall, and I'm dealing with severe chronic pain that makes it hard for me to walk. (I love walking, it is my main form of exercise, and I am accustomed to walking considerable distances to maintain my mental and physical health. I also live with chronic severe depression.)Every day when I wake up, I think ""okay this is a new day! You can make it good!"" Then it begins, I'm able to eat breakfast but everything after that is a battle. The isolation is overwhelming. I don't feel like doing any of the things I love to do, and I'm ashamed to talk about any of this with my friends. I don't feel I can bring it to my 12 step program because it isn't directly related to the disease we are there to talk about, and I don't want to seem like a drama queen.I'm too old for this, but I know one doesn't truly outgrow eating disorders. I'm very very sad, but feeling like I need to keep all of this quiet. I'm on the verge of tears a great deal of the time.It's very good of you to read this.Grievingpianist","Hi grievingpiantist, I don't have advice, but I wanted you to know that you are not alone. COVID has been triggering for me and I have strong urges to relapse, something that's been rare and of much less intensity for around twenty years. I understand how frustrating and disappointing being back here is. I feel like I shouldn't be going through this and that if I was strong, I wouldn't been here on the verge of a relapse. Know that you are not alone, both in terms of people who get it and are living it, but also in terms of people around you who are willing to support you. I'd encourage you to share with your therapist and your 12 step group what's been going on for you. Health issues are related and I suspect they'll understand that and also understand that COVID has changed everything, so sometimes people might veer from the ""norm."" Sending support.","Thanks, pursoul. It's good to know I have company among the ""veteran"" anorectics. (I get all over myself because I have lived with it for so long.) It's a heartbreaking disease, isn't it. Even when I am well, I don't really know what I look like (mirrors tell me I am fat, regardless of what my weight is). In some ways, I am grateful to know this - I am beginning to ignore the messages I send myself about my appearance. It takes work. I don't think relapse at this age has anything to do with body image, and everything to do with fear, loss, and grief.Yes, COVID has changed everything. I've been advised to keep my ED out of my twelve-step meetings, since the real focus there needs to remain on working the twelve steps. That's a bit challenging and I feel silenced by it, but the rules are not about me.So it's good (and hard) to be here. Thanks so much for your kind words.","First of all, thank you for coming here and sharing your experience. Second, I want you to know that you are NOT alone. There are many of us who are very young and that have struggled with eating disorders for many years. But still, there is HOPE. I really encourage you to meet with your therapist more often (if possible) and to continue to work on your eating disorder and depression issues.
COVID has changed everyone's lives and I have also had some slips every once and then.
To be honest, I don't think your friends and loved ones would mind or get tired of being a listening ear to you. They appreciate you and for sure they want you to be okay.
As you mentioned, every day is a new beginning. But not only every new day, also every single second of our lives. Take one minute at a time, one meal at a time, etc.
With regards to walking, I know how being unable to work out feels when you have done it all your life. Check if you qualify for some physical therapy so you can recover quickly from your fall and at the same time start mobilizing your muscles and joints.Hugs
Annet","Hello, I hope your are doing a bit better today. I wanted to tell you that you are welcome here. I don't come on here as often as I really should but every time I do, it has been a really good source of support and information.
I wish we could outgrow eating disorders! That would be amazing, wouldn't it? Unfortunately, they have a way of sticking around until they are completely treated in whatever the right way happens to be for us. It's really hard and completely understandable why you would be struggling with this right now. Can you see your therapist more? (via video of course). Can you spend more time with friends, even just over the phone? I think you need a way to feel less isolated. Your problems and needs should not be ignored and I'll bet your friends would love to help you if you will let them.
I'm in my mid 30's and struggled with anorexia and bulimia since I was a kid. It's a long journey. Please keep talking and reaching out.","I'm so grateful that I have found this forum! I also found another support group, which is worldwide and meets online. I can go there and told the truth. It is so comforting. I'm eating more. I saw my doctor Tuesday and I've increased weight a little bit. I told my anorexia voice, literally, to ""shut up!"" It worked. I wasn't upset by the bigger number, I was relieved by it. Still, the challenge of eating more is — well, the challenge of eating more. I'm doing it, I'm getting used to it, I'm also getting used to hating it. It's wonderful that all of you who are younger have found your way here. I wish I had had a resource like this decades ago, when anorexia was not recognized as an addictive disorder or even a mental illness. You just got slammed into the local hospital and fed, and fed, and fed. If that didn't work, they put you in the psych wing and give you the most medieval drugs in the world. So I didn't really start getting help that worked until I left the residential treatment center where I spent several weeks a decade ago. I think the problem with that program was they focused on eating disorders as a disease you can get over, and I knew that that wasn't true. It's a disease that you have to plan on battling for the rest of your life, just as you do alcoholism. In fact, when I got out of residential treatment, I relapsed immediately. This time I had a doctor who was absolutely THERE for me. She understood why treatment had flopped. At my age, I can't let that happen again. At my age (at any age), a serious relapse could be life-threatening. I want to say to all of you, keep going! I love seeing so many of you working recovery so diligently. I really admire you. And thanks for your support of this aging hippie who's still trying to get free.","Sending you hugs and hoping you are well. I am 46 and finally facing my ED head-on for the first time since my 20's. Some rough stuff over the past few years triggered me, something I thought I had been ""over"" for decades. The pandemic pushed it over the edge and I lost more, exercised more and really started to have some hormone and medical issues. I thought I would just tell myself to start eating and that was that but it's proving to be a lot harder than I expected. I've been doing some Enneagram work to really dig deep into motivations  but am truly just now accepting that this will always be a part of my life's journey.",Hugs to all of you reading this! Happy autumn and hoping the season brings strength and encouragement,,,
7,09/08/2020,Covid-19hasbeenanexcusefornotgettingbetter,"I do not know if anyone else will have similar experiences with these feelings, but here is what has been on my mind for quite some time now:
My ED seems to be using the Covid-19 Pandemic as an excuse for not recovering. It has made me want to ""put off"" getting healthy and gaining weight. A lot of my motivations for getting healthy again are irrelevant because of the pandemic. My brain thinks, ""What is the point of getting to a healthy weight? You still won't be able to get tattoos or travel for who knows how long."" I of course know that I would likely feel a lot better, be able to sleep, and be less stressed about food, but I have gotten so used to my typical routine of feeling like garbage and barely making it through the day, and without the opportunity to even do any of the things I had looked forward too before ED, it is so hard to find any motivation. I also have depression, which I have struggled with for years, so it just adds more hopelessness to my mindset. Another piece of this is that I kind of feel like my ED is invalidated because with shelter-in-place, no one has really seen how much weight I have lost. I know that I shouldn't have to ""prove"" my Anorexia and that EDs occur at any size, but still, in the back of my mind, I think I have to preserve this skinny body. Anyone else having difficulty pushing themselves to recover during Covid? Any tips for getting past this?","Hi, yoyokay! I have been recovered from my eating disorder for almost 3 years now and I used to feel a lot of the same things you are feeling. All the stress around Covid can definitely exacerbate things. I found my solution through 12-step but that was just my personal experience. Not everyone has the same path.","Hi. You mentioned feeling hopeless so for precaution, we wanted to provide you with these resources you can reach out to if you need additional support:Please take care and stay safe. ","Hi,
I can definitely relate to your feelings of capitulating to the ED in this time of COVID. My sister calls it an apocalyptic shit-hole (pardon my language) and while I'm not sure I think it's that bad, I am definitely suffering some negative effects from the whole thing. However, I have also found a few silver linings to hold on to. One is that I'm learning how to meditate-- I'm absolutely terrible at it, but I keep trying to practice and am hoping that at some point it will become a new tool for me to use in the face of anxiety. I am also learning how important it is to take time to do a self nurturing activity. I have never really believed in that, but just taking 10 min to do something ""frivolous"" can be very positive. Perhaps you can find a few things like that which can help you lift that feeling of hopelessness just a little?","Thank you. I will try my best. I am at a point where I am starting to feel more motivated to recover because my health has truly gotten bad. I still am very low mood-wise, but I think I can muster up enough energy to take steps towards getting better.","Hi Yoyokay,
You sent me a wonderful post of support the other day. Now it's my turn.My current relapse gathered steam in April and because no doctors were seeing patients and I wasn't getting weight checks, it really snuck up on me. I couldn't have friends over, so I invited anorexia in without realizing it. My panic about COVID was (still is) off the charts and it is exacerbating my panic disorder, OCD, and depression. Food is a whole new kind of scary - it seems to have this aura of deadliness around it. Which, we now know, is pretty much a crock.With my medical team checking in on me only by Zoom and only seeing my face, no one knew I was in trouble. I found out my looking objectively in the mirror and being scared by what I saw. And then not caring. So what. Who needed me around anyway. When I realized how dangerous that thinking was, I messaged my doctor. She got me in for an in-person visit immediately. That visit was my wake-up call. She also scheduled a bone density since I have had three minor fractures this spring. I'm 71, it turns out I have osteoporosis, so can't afford to mess around with this. (I'm postponing bone-building treatments until I've dealt with my ED. One monster at a time.)I MISS shopping, seeing friends, going out for dinner (even that); going to movies,the library; and more than anything GETTING HUGS. Dear God, I need those hugs.You don't have to prove your anorexia in order for it to be real. You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders. You're proving it to yourself. Here's something a friend mentioned to me in passing: we need strong immune systems right now. Anorexia compromises that.Don't know if it's ok to mention this here, but just this week I discovered another eating disorder support group. The Zoom meetings are worldwide and meet every day, several times a day. I love the program. I wish you well. Remember there are a lot of us walking beside you, even if you can't see us.",Thank you so much for the kind words. I really do not want to give this ED the power to have a lasting negative impact on my health. I need to keep reminding myself that I can do so much more if I am healthy.,"As you mentioned, we do not want to have an irreversible bad negative impact on our health due to letting our ED take care of our lives. You are a precious soul and you deserve to be happy. I know COVID has added too much stress and uncertainty to our lives. However, as one of my mindfulness teachers said: ""If you can not go outside, go inside"".Personally, I have used this time to focus on my recovery. It has been hard. I have also been seeing my team mainly via zoom. I do hate zoom! However, I have been doing my best to keep committed with the different challenges they have brought into my life.If you feel there is no reason to ""work hard"" on your recovery due to the COVID situation, just think that YOURSELF, your health and your happiness are worth it. It does not matter no one notices if you are better or worse. As long as you know you are caring for yourself and you are doing things for yourself, you will be in the right path.Trips and the ""outside life"" will eventually return and you may be willing to be ready to enjoy it as soon as it starts.Fight for yourself. Remember that you matter and that there are a lot of people (in person and virtually) that cares about you.Hugs

Now it is COVID and my parents think I am being sensitive and exaggerating COVID.

These are more expressed when the weather is gloomy. I am scared I am getting fat, I have no purpose and a million other crazy non productive thoughts.  When I exercise they go away (for a bit at least)
Is anyone else in this bad space?

You don't need to do anything to be valued and valuable.  You are beautiful for just being you.when it comes down to it, your weight is nothing but a number.

  Please keep us posted.  We are here to support you.   You can get through this.   I did after 30 years of suffering.","Hi Marygwen. I can relate 110% from the connection to identity all the way to feeling better when I exercise (momentarily). I have started affirmations, although I cry every time, they are forcing me to handle the nitty gritty of loving myself unconditionally not just when I am exercising or being productive or looking fine af bc I have been exercising. COVID has screwed me up and I am. working on changing the dialogue. Also feeling super stuck/trapped. Commenting to emphasize community and let you know you are more than your body. (Personally the gym is my safe space and them being closed makes me feel useless and incapable). Capitalism has forced us to believe our worth is based on our productivity and what we contribute to the world. You are more than that!","Hi Marygwen, I'm so sorry that Covid has triggered your eating disorder. And it's so important — so very, very important — that the people around you understand the real challenge you are facing. It's so easy to slap all of the reasons we are stressed out on Covid. It is, in fact, a very scary time for this nation. Those of us with addictive disorders are especially vulnerable. I was talking to my therapist the other day, and I asked her if I was the only one who was in relapse. She said that forums like this, and mental health professionals, are being overwhelmed by a huge spike in ED relapses. That isn't happy news at all, but it was cold comfort. I relapsed too; it started back in March when we all went into lock down. I felt scared of the disease, scared to touch anything, scared to go out in public, absolutely couldn't handle places like grocery stores. Gloves, mask, sanitizer sanitizer sanitizer sanitizer, disinfectant on everything including my groceries. I desperately needed to control something. It's still pretty awful. I didn't realize until too late that my weight was the thing I grabbed control of. I started losing weight without knowing it. I can't blame this on anything but my disease, but not being able to see my doctor in person gave the relapse a convenient camouflage. I don't own a scale; that would be like an alcoholic having a nice stash of an alcoholic beverage behind the washing machine. No one noticed. I started realizing that my thoughts were getting more and more irrational, everything felt a little crazier than it felt to the people around me. My boyfriend told me time and time again that I was out of control. Finally I caught myself in the mirror (I try to avoid mirrors at all costs) and I said to my reflection ""sweetheart, you look scary."" It was a wake-up call. Now I am working hard to restore weight, and going in for regular weight checks. It's very, very hard. It has everything to do with the pandemic and nothing to do with the pandemic. Stress triggers relapses, plain and simple. This is not my first rodeo. I'm 71 years old, and I remember that when I first got sick it really was about body image. Many years later, I relapsed after my father died, I moved from the home where I had lived for decades, I broke up with a long-term boyfriend. I told my therapist at the time that I was relapsing and she told me that at my age that was impossible. I left her immediately. Your parents are who they are. Here, we believe you. If you have a therapist or caring friends, they will believe you. I have recently found another online support group. All of their meetings are on zoom. It is a beautiful fellowship. People really tell their truth. There's a huge age range. If you Google them, their site will come up and you can look at the meeting list which is extensive. To me, this group is a godsend. First of all, remember that you are still you. You are a human being, not a human doing. Your professional life does not define you. Your spirit does, your intelligence does, your integrity does, what lives in your heart does. I'm afraid of the colder weather too. Gloom and drizzle run a number on my depression. Add isolation to that, and I'm pretty much screwed. I'm glad this forum is here, and I'm glad meetings are out there. It's not the same as getting a hug from someone you love, but I bet there are people in your life who really miss hugging you.","Hi, we again want to remind you that we edited part of your post since you mentioned another organization.

I've been struggling with my eating disorder ever since I was a teenager, nothing that has landed me in any facility. I suffer from s/c, a disorder that I feel does not get enough attention AT ALL. I even wanted to speak about it publicly. So why am I reaching out now? Not really sure, but it goes like this. I had Covid and have now lost much of my sense of taste and smell. Drs don't really know when or even if it will return. When I found myself engaging in ED behaviors regardless of the fact I am not even tasting the food, well HERE I AM! I was just doing with nuts...I know I can feel safe here and say, at least that was some sort of improvement because the cravings were ruling my life. But, now I have come to realize that it is ruling mine. It is just this activity that gives me...I think we all know the rest.

12,08/06/2020,COVID&healthissuestriggeringED,"TL/DR - COVID has worsened my stress related health issues (some autoimmune) and the weight loss from one of them has triggered an ED crisis and strong urge to relapse.When COVID and shelter at home started, I unexpectedly lost weight, which I only noticed because my pants were looser than normal. I have digestive issues (IBD, IBS, and others) and I saw my gastroenterologist who had me make med changes in hopes of stopping the weight loss and other digestive health symptoms (sorry, trying to not be triggering or gross by listing them). But my weight loss has continued, though it's slowed. There's been several problems with this situation:
1) I don't own a scale as I get triggered by knowing exactly how much I weigh. But now I had to start being weighed. I tried to only have it happen at doctor's offices because I ask them to not tell me the number and let them monitor it. But that's less possible now with COVID and I've had to weigh myself and record the weight.
2) There's been too much discussion about my weight by everyone - doctors, friends, family, and it means I think about it more and more. Just 2 days ago, a friend expressed great concern with how I looked (too thin). (I am still in the healthy BMI range.)
3) With COVID, I'm anxious about going to stores unnecessarily and when I do my every other week grocery shopping, I refuse to buy the foods I used to binge on. I recovered from the restricting anorexia I had in my teens twenty years ago, but I never got over the disordered eating of binging unhealthy foods and then restricting after to prevent weight gain. I've been successful at maintaining a constant ""normal"" weight, so I've just left my recovery linger there. But now, when I want to emotionally eat, I can't unless I want to risk getting COVID for a food binge run. So I don't eat anything (I'm not saying I skipped a meal but that I don't eat the extra I normally do - I'm choosing to shut down and numb instead of eating my emotions). At first, I thought I was fine. At the start of COVID, I was at my sister's helping with my nephews (her and her husband are essential workers in healthcare) nearly everyday from mid-March through the end of May and they were feeding me, so I ate normally. But that's also when I lost the most weight, though it happened pretty rapidly right at the beginning, again when I was eating regular meals and not paying attention to amount or content because I was just having a nice family meal. But now, I'm home alone most times and I've grown to really like how much weight I lost. I also notice the loose skin and untoned arms, etc. I'm pretty sure I've started eating less, on top of not bingeing, so now I don't know if the continued weight loss is my health issue or my eating behaviors. I see my gastroenterologist on Monday, so I've been thinking about it a lot, but I wasn't concerned until my friend expressed so much concern about my weight and if I am truly honest with myself, my face looks gaunt, not healthy. I've noticed I've been exercising more, though it looks healthy because I'm walking my dog, but I'm choosing hilly areas and sometimes doubling the length of walks. But what's really concerned me is that I finally broke down and bought my favorite binge food to go with a food my sister made me from scratch. But, I'm barely eating it. Even when I'm emotional, I see how much I have a smug satisfaction that I'm not eating the binge food. When I have a very small serving, I find myself satisfied I had so much restraint. I see me sliding down a slope where I try to control COVID by controlling my weight and what I eat and how much and when. I am starting to worry about where this leads. I'm trying to figure out my next step. But I can say that I don't want to go back to my ""normal"" weight. I like how I look and I want control over wanting to eat and I feel good about life. But I'm also pretty sure there's a darker side because I don't want to say anything to my therapist or too much to my gastroenterologist or to reach out to my PCP. I want to see how much less I can eat and how much ""healthier"" I can eat and if I can lose even more weight. I feel like I'm at that fork in the road between health and relapse and I'm not sure I'm capable of picking the healthy path. It's not that I've never come close to or actually briefly relapsed, it's that I always had people around who were kind of silently keeping tabs and I had reasons to enjoy food and I wasn't so afraid of everything that's happening in the world and so very desperate for control over something. If I'm not going to binge and eat my emotions, then I feel I need to restrict to numb them, to control them. This time, it will be much much harder to choose to eat. It's always a choice, every time I eat, there's that evil voice in my head encouraging me to restrict, but everyday, nearly every meal, I've overcome it for years. But right now, I don't want to. It will be so much energy to overcome those thoughts. I don't know how to pick the better path right now. This seems like the perfect solution to all sorts of problems. I need support.","Welcome to the forums!

13,05/20/2020,TFWyouthinkyou're100%recoveredbutthenBAMherecomesquarantine!,"TLDR: Covid is bringing back old pre-recovery feels. Who else is feeling this? What healthy coping mechanisms do you use? I'd been considering myself ""officially recovered"" from my eating disorder for a couple years now, but like many others in this situation I feel like I'm starting to relapse thanks to covid19. I suffered from a combination of multiple disordered eating habits and over-exercising. I only talk to my therapist every other week now and stopped going to my dietitian because I didn't feel like I needed them (also my therapist is expensive and I'm a poor grad student haha!). But over the past month or two, as my work schedule was cut in half, going to the grocery store has become an anxiety-attack trap, and climbing gyms are closed (climbing and riding bikes are my activities of choice), I'm starting to feel like the lack of control is putting me back in that ED headspace of needing to control something, feeling discontent with my body, extremely paranoid that I'm gaining weight, etc. One thing I've been trying to do that I think would be helpful is limiting how much time I spend on social media (this has proven to be very difficult haha!). As a cyclist I follow a lot of fellow cyclists and cycling accounts, and I've found that exercise-heavy instagram accounts make me think more about how little I am exercising in comparison to them, and then I feel bad about myself (I know this is totally irrational since some of them are professionals, or racers, or whatever, and I'm not at that level nor do I want to be nor would it be healthy or realistic for me to be, but I still compare myself with them subconsciously). The weather has been pretty crappy too this spring so there've been many days when I don't even want to be outside. But even so, I feel this guilt on days when I don't exercise and then I start doing this very negative self-talk, accusing myself of things that I know deep down aren't true or real but that's all part of the disorder I suppose. I'm trying to do deep breathing exercises when I start getting freaked out, and I'm trying to talk to people who empathize with me. My partner is supportive too but since we are quarantined together I feel bad for constantly complaining about my ED to him all the time, especially since he really has no idea what it's like. I wish I could be totally content with my body and unconcerned about it like he is about his own. Today has been an especially rough day. I had planned this relatively long and strenuous ride to do today but due to mechanical issues with my bike wasn't able to do it after all, and felt real crappy about not riding on a day when I finally have a chance to. At work I sit in front of a computer all day and that lack of movement bothers me, and I've been driving there instead of riding my bike so that I can give a coworker a ride, and that makes me feel crappy too. Also in grad school, most of my classes are online (especially now) which requires a lot of sitting at my computer doing schoolwork. These things trigger this feeling of discontent and disgust at my body, feelings that I honestly have not felt in probably three or four years, and I feel like my recovery progress is being peeled back bit by bit. I just feel like this big dark cloud of doom is slowly gliding over toward me. This feeling is so familiar to me but I haven't felt it like this for a while. I feel unmotivated to do things that I normally enjoy and sometimes all I want to do is take a nap that lasts all dang day so I don't have to worry about stuff and can pass the time without having disordered thoughts. I've been tempted to buy a scale recently but I know that will not lead to anything good. I've even thought about borrowing a scale from my workplace but I keep having to tell myself that it will not do any good. I gotta keep reminding myself that it's not all that bad. There are some silver linings to this quarantine thing for me and I am grateful for them. Still, I have days when I feel like I'm slipping back down to that dark place and those feelings come back and haunt me.",Welcome to the forums! We hope you find support here.

I have AN, used to have a job where I was on my feet all day moving around, and would exercise for hours a day before and after work, mostly running several miles. Now, I have an office/desk job and have been told not to exercise for medical safety. It is a very difficult compulsion to turn away, especially when I encounter a challenging food situation that raises my anxiety. I used to spend my lunch hour speed walking around the neighborhood, but have finally gotten myself to stop. I just want to remind you that your body needs food regardless of not exercising, and not exercising does not equal failure. I know ED can make missing a planned exercise feel incredibly guilty, but it is natural and okay not to exercise every day! Sending love.","Hi pupper, I don't have great advice but I wanted to let you know you are not alone. I'm struggling a lot with my ED right now and I've recovered for a long time. I didn't think I'm be down this road again where I want very badly to fall back into controlling something too as a way to cope with the uncertainty of our times. I related to a lot of your post and I'm glad you posted it so I know I'm not alone either.",,,,,,
14,07/31/2020,WanttoTalkwithotherswithsimilarproblems...?(Yesthat'saqmark),"Hi.So I'm almost eighteen and I'm a little concerned about how I eat. I'm a healthy weight, but I've realized I focus a lot about my food. I started tracking what I eat around five years ago when my older friend got me into fitness and running. I became very restrictive, and sometimes would skip meals if they didn't suit my idea of healthy (My clubs often go until 8 or 9 and then it takes me an hour to bike home, but I wouldn't like the food so sometimes I'd just skip eating and then eat a lot at home). After I quit x country freshman year of highschool I put on X pounds and became sort of self conscious about it. Then when I went on vacation I got up to X lb which was a lot for me, I'm 5'2. After that I went on an X diet for a few weeks, then X to got X, but since then it just feels like I'm either putting on weight of dieting. I have a habit of eating really well and then not, and then eating a bunch of X and stuff, so I'll gain again and then drop it. I think I'd probably gain more but I can't drive so I bike everywhere. I wouldn't really describe myself usually as having any disordered type of eating, because I'm a healthy weight, but I'm always thinking about my food. I always make meals that are different from what the rest of my family eats. If I'm putting on weight I'm stressed and feeling kinda bad. I don't purge, and I wouldn't say that I exercise compusively, but I'm getting sorta nervous. I don't like the idea of being labeled with an eating disorder, especially because for the most part I think I'm in good health, but I feel self conscious about how I eat. I'm not sure that a lot of my friends track their food like I do, and worry about it so much. And if I'm honest I'm sort of sick of either being ill because I’ve eaten too much or too little. I'm not really sure what to do,and I just want to talk with people who maybe experience the same thing. I don't have the sort of personality where people think I'd struggle with this (whatever it is). People see me eat, watch me exercise, I'm very loud very energetic, very confident. I get that struggling with this sort of stuff is supposed to be normal, but I'm not comfortable enough to just bring it up to my friends.I guess that I'd just like to talk to people who I feel like won't be sort of scared of me if I say stuff like this. I just kinda want to be able to talk to others with something similar.
So I guess just comment? Or offer advice? Whatever the spirit compels?

I understand not wanting to be given the label of having an eating disorder,  but if you do have one, being informed and getting professional help will save your life.
  And if you have an eating disorder,  you're not in good health.   Weight and body size does not mean you are healthy.","Before I was ready to acknowledge that I had an eating disorder, I was experiencing a lot of similarities. Unlike you, I was compulsively and excessively exercising, but like you, I was constantly thinking about foods, whether that was being afraid to eat unhealthy foods, or craving foods but denying myself permission to eat them. I didn't think I needed help because ""there are people who are skinnier than me."" Now, I am at a dangerously low weight and am struggling with the impact on my mental health as well. I would strongly recommend talking through these feelings with a therapist, even if not an eating disorder specialist. They can help you navigate these feelings and find a healthier relationship with food and your body. Not every person who has an ED is underweight! That does not mean that the situation is not serious.I know that it is stressful to be constantly thinking about and planning around food. I hope you can find a way to lessen the constant food thoughts.",,,,,,,
15,07/19/2020,Feellikegivingintothedisorder,"This whole year has been a real struggle for me with my disorder. At the beginning of the year I uninentionally lost a substantial amount of weight at a festival, and being at this lower weight (and enjoying the compliments and self-satisfaction along with with it) drove me back into some really disordered eating habits. I managed to keep myself busy with work (40-50 hour weeks) to avoid binging, however I found myself mentally and physically exhausted, not prioritising my health and often falling into the cycle of binging and purging.After this happened, then covid happened, and I felt like I was in the worst headspace possible to go through this. I'm trying to adopt strategies to keep myself busy (to avoid binging), and I'm lucky to have a job in hospitality 3 days a week, however on my days off I feel like I am constantly thinking about food, and after every meal I feel bloated or fear of gaining weight. I've tried to properly recover during this time by implementing regular meals (like what they do in recovery after discharge) however, after a few days I feel overweight or unhappy with my body, and restrict and use disordered eating habits to return back to a weight that I am happy with.To add to things, we live in a small house, and I feel like I am constantly being watched by my parents. I went through recovery 6 years ago using family based therapy, and I achieved the 'goal weight' however my mental health has been pretty inconsistent and I've felt consumed by the disorder since my first round of recovery. I feel a sense of bitterness towards my parents as I feel that their approach to my recovery was quite disconnected (they just wanted me to get back to normal so their lives could get back to normal), and I had no real support during my recovery due to their inability to try to understand the severity of my disorder, or they tried to apply their own 'formula' to my recovery, without considering my feelings and emotions. Being with them 24/7 is triggering thoughts from my past whilst also making me feel quite isolated, with no one to confide in, or no way to let my thoughts out.Anyways, I bottled up these emotions for years and eventually I just let them all out during and argument with my parents. I told my parents about the binging, constant weighing and how my headspace is really unhealthy and painful almost all the time. They proceeded to say that you can't change the past (which I know is true), but completely disregarded my feelings once again, and I felt like it reopened the wound from six years ago, whilst also ignoring my current pain, making me feel more isolated than ever. So, I'm basically at this stage where Victoria is in lockdown for the next 6 weeks, and I'm stuck with my parents who have complete disregard for my emotional headspace, and entrapment within my own disordered cycle, but also I revealed all my disordered strategies to them, so now I have to be super secretive whilst weighing food and myself etc. I thought that telling them would help, but rather its left me feeling trapped and my disordered thoughts feel harder to fight than ever.Sorry about the rant but I felt like I needed to let it out, and hopefully make some of you guys feel less alone. Let me know if theres any strategies you use to help, because right now I need support more than ever.","Hi dainna43 – thank you for posting, we’re glad you’re here on the forums.

Last spring, I abruptly lost a significant amount of weight — totally healthy, it just kind of fell off — and really, really enjoyed it. Too much, probably. I managed to hold back my actual self-destructive habits, but the mentality was still there. I ate reasonably healthy and went to the gym reasonably regularly, and it became something I didn’t even have to think about (much) for months.Now, I’m not able to go to the gym because of the pandemic, and we’ve gotten a lot of comfort food in the house (also because of the pandemic), and I’ve put on weight and it’s ALL I can think about. I’ll feel stressed about it, and binge, and then want to purge, but I manage not to, so I keep gaining weight and keep being stressed about it. And when I try to go back to my former, healthy eating and exercise habits (as much as I’m able), now it isn’t about being healthy anymore — everything is all about MUST DO THIS SO I CAN GET SKINNY AGAIN. So I can’t escape it. And it’s just this horrible cycle that gets worse and worse.It doesn’t help that everyone around me keeps talking about their “Covid 15, ha ha ha,” and how they’ll lose it later, and this is a difficult time and we need to give ourselves a break, and blah blah blah. Yeah, if I were capable of giving myself a break, I wouldn’t be in this situation. I wouldn’t have been in this situation for eight straight years in my teens and twenties. My boyfriend, at least, is sympathetic, but he also doesn’t entirely understand because he hasn’t been there.I wish I had strategies to offer, but I have none. Just sympathy. And if it helps, reading this really did make me feel less alone. I hope that reading THIS makes you feel less alone, too.",,,,,,,,
16,05/06/2020,DoIhaveaneatingdisorderorit'sjustme,"Hi i'm actually not from the states but I do have relatives there. In our country, eating disorders are not very much discussed but it is a toxic trait of our nationality that kids are getting teased when we get chubby. I was chubby in my teen years but I decided to lose some weight cause of all the aunties teasing me and as well my family...since then I have been very strict on what i eat and I feel guilty when i over indulge from my favorite foods.. I was thinking at some point "" why is it so easy for others to eat a lot and still look great? while i haven't reached my ideal weight and I get fat by just eating my favorite food??""until now in my adulthood, I've always continued my healthy lifestyle, but when i get to college i have times that i just can't eat healthy cause fast food are more convenient for me but I try to eat healthy at least once a day...Now in isolation, I have decided to set a goal for myself but cant complete my exercise or food goals and feel guilty.So to summarize: i've been having hard time in my eating psychology and sometimes it depresses if it's really an illness (cause i have not went to a doctor and seems like not lots of doctors sepcialize this condition here in our place) or is it just me overacting to what i want to look like?? heheh i think i just need someone to talk to :(","We are sorry to hear you are struggling.

The good thing is, you are at a stage where you can seek help and hope it doesn’t get any worse. The bad thing is, if you don’t, it can be very easy to let it spiral. I’m no medical expert, so I suggest reading through and researching more about different types of eating disorders. It’s important to recognize what these different courses of action actually do to your body and WHY they don’t work. Myself, I know my bulimia and recently discovered laxative abuse are doing much more harm than good, but it’s like a psychological crutch. I think you’re in a very vulnerable state. It’d be beneficial to yourself to speak with a healthcare provider if you can. Although you may not have a full fledged eating disorder, you are definitely on a very wide path that can very quickly narrow down. You are absolutely validated, and this is a tough experience to go through. Please seek help if you can, and get some resources before something awful and consuming takes over you!Cheers,
Xoxo","we are not allowed to diagnose you or say whether or not you have an eating disorder.  Only a medical professional is able to do that, and it would be a disservice for us to even try.  There's also a short, temporary screening on this site that could give you a better idea, but not take the place of, a medical professional.   I hope this helps.

17,07/11/2020,WhatdoIdo?,"I have never been to a therapist. My family can't really afford one, so I've never gone. I feel guilty being in a place like this without an official diagnosis, and I'm still partially in denial that I have a problem. Spring semester of 2019, I was really bad off though. I was down to a very low weight, I was having urges to throw my food back up, I was over-exercising, restricting or skipping meals, and I was getting very thin. I didn't see that though. People would point out that I was getting thin, but I didn't see myself as too thin. When COVID hit, I was laid off from work, my classes were put off for a while, and the gym was closed. I do love food so I end up in these conflicts with myself cause I just want to eat, but then I feel so horrible for doing so. It'd take me ages to figure out what to make for a meal, cause in my head I'd be calculating all the nutrition and caloric info to see what would be the ""healthiest."" I gained back some weight over the quarantine, and I am a very small woman so it shows. Classes, work, and even the gym is back up and I can already feel myself starting to slide down that hole again. I eat and I feel sick, I end up binging cause I'm so hungry and I feel bad about it, but then I barely eat for a while cause I have no appetite. I look in the mirror and all I can seem to look at is where it's not perfect. All I see are flaws, and I feel like I need to punish myself for not doing better during quarantine, despite still exercising and eating fairly healthy. I want to feel beautiful. I am uncomfortable with the way I look, but I also don't want to end up down that rabbit hole again. I don't want to be dizzy, hungry, and obsessive. Those who have been through this and recovered, what did you do? How do you fight back those thoughts when you start gaining back weight? How do you ensure that you eat the right amount? Not too much not too little. I want comfort, to be told I'm going to be alright despite the world falling to pieces around me, and to be told I'm beautiful and believe it, which I know sounds stuck-up and silly. I also want to know what I can do to get better. I have a wonderful boyfriend, he doesn't know about what's going on since he lives in another country, but I want to take care of myself for him if not for myself. He means the world to me. I rambled a lot here, sorry about that, but please? I want to know what I can do...","Hi BrokenBird14, welcome to the forums!

Hopefully this can be helpful to you, and again, welcome!  Additionally, because you mentioned feeling dizzy:  The following are just some of the signs of a serious problem that demands immediate medical attention:
If you experience anything above, we highly recommend seeking help from a medical professional as soon as possible. Seek medical help soon on an outpatient basis if you:
 ","If you are still a student, I think your school's counselling center could be pretty useful to you. The first time I attempted recovery was at University and there I got the best counselor I have ever had. He helped me recover from anorexia and I was fine for several years. Then, I relapsed and started with binge eating and bulimia but that is another story.
Many years later, when I was studying a master's degree abroad, I approached the University counsellors and they helped me until I graduated.
I know schools may offer limited sessions but there are some that either make some exceptions or simply do not have a limit of sessions set.
I would strongly encourage you to get some professional help with them. It could make a big difference to you.
Coronavirus has changed everyone's lives for good and for bad... All of us who struggle with eating disorders got more impacted because we had more time to be with ourselves and to face the ""eating disorder monster"".
With regards to some of your questions, I still struggle with some ED thoughts. They are not there always, they do not torture me as in the past. So, the only thing I can say is that the more you challenge them and let them pass without action on them, the weaker they get. It is just a matter of time.I still do not know if I eat the right amount or not. I see a dietician and she gives me baby steps to accomplish each session. I can not follow a set meal plan but for example, she tells me, from now to the next session, I need you to work on incorporating a snack. Or I need you to eat another piece of bread or a bigger snack... Things like that... Little by little I have been eating more and more. In that way, I have not felt overwhelmed or felt like vomiting.I do not know you but just by reading your words I know you have a beautiful soul. So, every time you look yourself at the mirror, tell yourself loudly how beautiful you are and go over the parts of your body you love. Something that helps me is to think about the things they do for me instead of how they look like.For example: I say: ""I love my legs because they let me walk, move around this world and visit a lot of places on my own"" (instead of thinking if they are toned or not or if I like them or not)","I just wanted to add that 98 percent of the time I do not obsess over or think about my body, hate my body or struggle to eat.  After 30 years of ed, I am finally free.  I fought as hard as I could for recovery and life.   Over the past 4 years, I have been in and out of treatment,  from inpatient to residential,  php, iop and outpatient.  I have worked and fought hard to be where I am.  Somewhere along the way, I got myself back.  Somewhere along the way,  I stopped hating the person in the mirror.   I faced my past traumas that were interfering with my day to day life.  I have the support of my mom and husband.   I have a beautiful fur baby that adores me.  A short haired tiger tabby.
  My advice is to seek professional help.   If you are ready to face the ed monster and willing to work hard at recovery and go against Ed, you will succeed.

21,05/09/2020,slipping,"Initially when everything shut down, I felt like I was holding a pretty even keel and even making some headway in recovery since I had a bit more time to spend on myself and pro-recovery activities. However, since week 1 I have been mandated to provide childcare for first responders and essential workers by the governor. I don't mind my co-workers or the kids (although more and more attitude seems to be cropping up), but my supervisors are making the job intolerable. They are constantly contradicting each other, giving mixed messages, conflicting instructions, and yelling at us when we don't do exactly what they said (which incidentally seems to change by the hour). We are feeling like children ourselves who are being nagged at constantly. At this point, we don't know who to go to up the chain to ameliorate the situation and it is quickly headed downhill. As a result, my stress level has gone way up and although I am trying to engage in positive activities such as meditation, going for walks, etc. I find that I am very slowly sliding backwards. It is scaring me as it is a direction I certainly don't want to go.
In ""retaliation"" I have started implementing snacks with more rigor and plan to discuss this with my therapist on Tues.
Thanks for listening.","I know things are difficult. This whole work situation is very frustrating. Maybe if you and your co-workers get together and all talk to the superiors and confront the problem, or ask the most outgoing of your co-workers.

23,05/18/2020,"Myfirstpost-pleasehelp,Iamrelapsing","Hi everyone, this is my first post here and I could use some advice. I’ve struggled with an ED for a long time and just before the COVID 19 stay at home orders I was getting help from a therapist. It’s really unfortunate timing that when I FINALLY decide to get help, I no longer can go talk with my therapist (the over the phone/telemed doesn’t work well for me, my whole family can hear our conversations and it makes me uncomfortable). I started exercising a lot again and for a while I thought I was just being healthy but now, looking back at it, I realize it may have been excessive and may have been the start of my relapse. I have been obsessing over my workout regimen and my weight and there was a period of time I wasn’t eating much because I just didn’t feel hungry. I’ve been in and out of these phases before but it has been years since I found myself in so deep. Out of nowhere two weeks ago, my motivation just stopped. I still obsessed over my weight and panicked about it but I began exercising less and less making the mental toll of it all even worse. Now I find myself binging constantly and no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to stop myself. I am waking up in the middle of the night panicking about my weight and sometimes even grabbing the areas on my body which I focus on most. I physically feel disgusted with myself but the binging is so impulsive and now I’m struggling to even exercise to balance out what I’m eating. It’s a really bad cycle of excessive exercise and binging and for the first time, I’m having a really hard time managing it. If any of you have any advice on how you pull yourself out of these cycles, any advice on how you cope or manage, or even if you can just relate, please respond. I could really use any support because I feel like I am spiraling. None of my family members understand what it is like to have an ED (and I’m thankful they have never had to experience it) but because of that they sometimes make comments on my eating behaviors as if it’s a choice I make. I hate the way that it just consumes me and I’m wondering if some of you can relate? Thank you all in advance","Hi Kaitlyn - I'm so sorry you're going through this right now. I relate to so much of what you are going through, EDs really can feel consuming and I'm sorry you're having to deal with all of this on top of the pandemic. I think you should be proud of yourself for being mindful and noticing that you are relapsing. During my recovery (from BED specifically), I relapsed a LOT. For many people, it is a part of recovery, so please don't feel discouraged. If you are not able to comfortably talk to someone right now, maybe it might be helpful to journal your feelings.  You mentioned your family sometimes makes comments - are they aware that you're currently recovering from an ED? Is there a way you can communicate to them that their comments are not helpful? Anyway, I don't know how much of this will speak to you, but my heart truly goes out to you and you are SO not alone. So many of my relapses, I felt like I wasn't being brave enough to really be mindful about what was happening. I think the fact that you are so in-tune with what's happening (even if what's happening is an ED relapse which I get is NOT ideal) is brave and amazing. Take it easy on yourself and try and focus on things you love about yourself (when you are able). Take care! <3 STP","Thank you so much for your kind response. Just knowing that I’m not alone in all of this helps me SO MUCH. I have never had the chance to talk with someone else who has struggled/is currently struggling with an ED. To answer your question, I have brought it up to my family that I have relapsed and that that is why my behaviors have changed. I have also mentioned that their words are not helping me. They don’t mean to hurt me, I think it is just that they truly don’t understand and aren’t sure how to handle it. I can tell my mom feels awful when I try to explain to her what I have been going through, but there is still a disconnect. They don’t realize that their words can hurt because it is a really sensitive topic as I’m sure you understand. I have noticed that this website has a lot of resources for family members as well and I may suggest having her look into that. I think it may be helpful for her to speak with other people who have family suffering from an ED in the same way it is helpful for me to talk with you. Thank you for being so honest with me about your journey. I guess since I haven’t really spoken with anyone else, I didn’t realize that relapse/recognition of that relapse is a part of healing but you are SO right about that. Again, thank you so so much for your response. It may seem like such a minor thing to some, but it is really bringing tears to my eyes. This is the first time that I have put myself out here like this and to have you write back to me with such a supportive and heart-felt response makes me smile. I hope that you are doing well and staying strong. Thanks again <3",,,,,,,,
24,05/16/2020,Ineedadvice,"I was doing really well in my recovery before quarantine started, and then with having to be isolated and stuck in my thoughts all day I started to slip up and it turned out to lead to the most severe relapse I've ever had. I'm currently back in residential treatment and I'm doing really well again. I was just wondering if anyone had any advice on how to manage my eating disorder during all this isolation because I will be returning home next week if my heart rate is high enough. I really don't want to go home and have the same thing happen again.","It's a hard challenge you face, I can't give you all the answers because the truth is, there is no right answer for everyone and there is no cure all. All you can do is keep reminding yourself why you are recovering; to feel better, to live longer, and to be healthy. Whatever it is, remind yourself everyday. And stick to meal plans, or goals! Seek encouragement from friends and family and distance yourself from toxic encouragement. Good luck!",I really appreciate your feedback. I'm new to this whole NEDA thing and it feels really good to know other people are rooting for me. I hope you are doing well too <3 The only difficult thing is the stress of being at home 24/7 with my 4 younger siblings is kind of a toxic environment that I can't avoid. It's really stressful and part of my relapse. it's just a really sticky situation.,,,,,,,,
25,04/10/2020,Istrugglewhileinquarantine,"Hi, I´m not quite sure what so say, because I feel like I´m making  everything up and nothing´s actually going on. Please excuse any grammar mistakes, english isn´t my mother language. I´ve struggled with an eating disorder, EDNOS, for over three years and for over the last eight months I was convinced I´m recovered. Recently I realised that I´m actully in quasi-recovery and I still keep so many habits from my ED. This situation doesn´t help at all, because I´m stuck at home where everyone is fighting, my step dad and I don´t have the best relationship and he caused a lot of relapses during my ED and later recovery. I don´t blame him, I know my brain made everything seem so much worse, but because of him I´m anxious, I want to restrict again and lately due to self isolation I feel a lot more insecure about the way I look. I´ve never lost huge amount of weight because of my ED, but I´ve always been skinny. Even now doctors say I´m slightly underweight (because of BMI). I don´t want to put any numbers in here, because I don´t want to trigger anyone, but the thing is I know I´m not fat. But I just want to be perfect and feel in control again. There´s not much I can do about the family situation, believe me, I tried. But nothing is ever good enough for him. I just want to be in charge again and having this little secret, my eating disorder, helps. It´s really hard, because I know it´s wrong and it won´t actually help, but I don´t have the energy to fight back. I don´t know...am I making any sense? I´m really scared to post this, but I keep telling myself that it´s okay to ask for help or even an advice. That´s something I still haven´t learnt.","You’re definitely making sense. Being quarantined with my parents is causing me the same feelings because things are tense and weird with them, and I find myself thinking of falling back into old habits. At the same time, it’s like you said, it won’t acrually help us. The ED will be in control, so it’s not actually helping us cope any better. I’m here for you.",Thank you so much. I´m glad that I´m not the only one who feels this way. I´m here for you as well.,That sums up how I am feeling perfectly. Being stuck in the house with my parents who regularly make comments about my weight is really starting to effect me. I binge way more than I used to and I am starting to fall back into old habits. It just sucks because I feel like there is nothing that I can do about it.,"I feel the same way. My ED is my way of gaining control when I can't control what happens in my life. But at a point I have to accept that my ED will not help, it can't help me control anything. I don't know why it's nice to have that secret, but it does not help. I'm sorry things are tense in the house, it is really hard, but maybe it can be a time for growth. A time for you to fully focus on recovery and your hobbies. Sending you hugs!",I completely understand where you are coming from. Being back home has caused me to go back to old habits because my family can often trigger my eating disorder with comments they make. It’s hard to be around people that are suppose to be there as support but just make it harder to recover. I’ve only recently gotten help so it’s been hard to keep practicing my methods while back home. I also understand how quarantine makes you focus on your looks. I keep checking my stomach to see if it’s expanded and constantly feel like I’m gaining weight. I hope you know you’re not alone in this and that I’m sending you love and support !,"Man I can relate to you guys so hard. Being back home from my dorm life has been very difficult and triggering for me. You are making perfect sense to me, maybe we can create a chat with people in these situations to discuss our feelings and share solutions. I miss pre-lockdown days, so very much.","hey all,I can totally understand everyones take on this.Isolation is making my ED worse as I've little opportunity to challenge myself, am paranoid about my changing body now I can't go to the gym and feeling I have to be more in control of food as everything requires ordering online and planning. I find being around my family triggering too so can understand.I think at this point we have to make peace with our situation and work towards small goals. Have something each day to aim for. Easier said than done I know. I went and brought a scale during lockdown having stopped daily weighing two years ago and seeing the number has risen by 10 pounds due to the binge element of my anorexia was definitely distressing. I'm trying to channel my emotions towards working hard to get that newly gained weight off and tackle triggers to the binges. The main trigger for me is alcohol as it makes me relaxed enough to eat different things but then I go from zero to 100. I wish I could find that balance.These are testing times but having one another to share things with helps :)","Hello ,
I've read all your comments and I'm sitting here crying. I was in your shoes for years. Its so very hard and painful and isolating. I had anorexia / bulemia for 14 years, (from age 14-29) so all through high school and college.  I've overcome it and been healthy now for 8 years. I just today realised that I want to try to help younger people that are going through this pain and to help get through it and overcome it.

26,05/14/2020,icanstopthinkingaboutfood,"when this quarantine started, i had just began to start eating better again and not purge anymore. however, this quarantine has made everything start to go back to the way it uses to be and i don’t know what to do. i’ll try to eat at what’s considered “normal” portions, but then i’ll feel like i ate too much and all i can think about is wanting to throw it up. every time i eat anything at all, i feel terrible about it for the rest of the day. i’ve recently started going back to these old habits and i’m scared that i’m gonna end up right back where i was before i started to get eat better. i just don’t know what to do anymore.","I understand. I've been in your situation for years. It's very hard to control especially when you are at home and all you can think about is food and what you ate and how to get rid of it. I went back and forth with being 'better' and then purging excessively. I've been cured for 8 years and I would be glad to offer you support if you would like it.

27,05/11/2020,bingingduringquarentine,"I have struggled with binge- eating disorder for a couple of years now which has led to significant weight gain over the two years. A couple of months ago, I started lifting weights and eating a healthy and appropriate amount. Lifting weights is one of the only forms of exercise that I enjoy and without it, I don't feel the need to eat clean anymore. With COVID-19 and all the gyms being closed, I have not had the chance to lift weights like I used to and I am starting to gain weight again. I am extremely self- conscious about my weight and due to the coronavirus I had to move from my college apartment back home with my verbally abusive parents who regularly make comments about my weight. This has been hard for me to deal with because I know there is nothing that I can do about it. I had ""friends"" at college that sometimes made comments about my weight but I go to a big school and it is easier for me to avoid them. I just feel like I am at a stand still and there is nothing that I can do about it.","well, shame on your parents for bugging you about your weight..on this website i read an article about intuitive eating.  I'm trying 2 eat like this for dinner 2night.glad you are reaching out.  I found that when my family criticized me about my weight, I overate even more.  Can u talk w/ your parents and tell them how you feel when they hassle u about your eating/weight?  You need their support, not criticism. hope this helps.",,,,,,,,,
28,04/07/2020,nogym,"I'm addicted to exercise and am losing my mind, terrified I'm gaining weight. I know it's the last thing I should be worried about right now but I am - I'm disgusted by my changing appearance. I'm getting in bodyweight workouts and honestly - I'm probably getting stronger. It's just the changes that cause me to panic. I don't want to start restricting.","Hi banneka. We wanted to bring your attention to NEDA's COVID19 resources to help you during this stressful time.

And i'm sure it's really hard to be cooped up inside, I understand. Take some time to ground yourself, and I hope things get better.","I understand how you're feeling and have definitely had similar experiences. I remember feeling like I wanted to crawl out of my skin because I was so disgusted with myself. Somehow, I have gotten past those sorts of feelings, but it is painful just to recall them. All I can tell you is that you WILL get through it, you are NOT disgusting, and this virus will not keep you inside forever. Since this is your reality right now though, is there someone you can talk to honestly about your feelings? Maybe you can make a list of all the great things you appreciate about your body that might help put things in perspective? Hang in there.","I totally understand. The first thought I had when I heard about lockdown was how will I work out? And it caused my anxiety to heighten and I pretty much freaked out. I then googled home workouts, brought some equipment from amazon and started cycling. All in all I have figured out a good workout routine that is challenging. Try to get some home equipment and look on youtube for boxing workouts.I think when exercise is such a big part of a persons life it helps calm the mind in general, and when thats removed it's like a coping mechanism is eliminated. Good luck!","I also am addicted to exercise and am recovering from an eating disorder (anorexia).   I was discharged from IOP the week before everything shut down.  I was an ultra-marathoner and an ironman triathlete in another life and after discharge,  I just wanted to be allowed to swim, since it's a good way to handle anxiety and good for your body.  But the pools closed immediately.  I have started walking more--I always hated walking, I thought it was boring and took too much time, but I've grown to really love it and I can walk 3 miles and feel like I've gotten out of the house and done some movement.  And I ride my bike, but only for an hour.  I've found one place to swim, a deep water lake 30 miles away, and I've driven up there a couple of times.  But in general I've had to adjust, and trust my team (therapist, dietician) and listen to what they have to say about how easy it is for exercise to take over my life again.  And I have to be super careful not to restrict due to decreased exercise---which I have done a bit of, honestly---we're not perfect, especially not in these conditions.  This is a nightmare scenario for us and yet getting through post-treatment in a pandemic, where you are TOLD to isolate, URGED not to go to restaurants or the grocery store, is only going to make us stronger.  I have to believe that.  I have to believe it.  I hope this helps.  I hope the urges subside.  i hope you learn to like walking.  I have seen some stuff on my walks that I've never seen before and I've lived in this neighborhood for ten years!","Hi Texheel,
I can relate to a lot of what you said. I used to hate walking too-- I much preferred the faster pace of running. I am not a huge fan of swimming pools even though I am a good swimmer, so the pool closure wasn't a big deal to me. However, like you I have gained a real appreciation for a walk during quarantine. It is also my way to get out and move around, get some fresh air, exercise and be gentle on my body, enjoy nature, de-stress, and re-center. I now feel like I gain a huge benefit from walking on so many levels. I don't even think about what I ""loose"" out on from a walk instead of run because I don't see it as a loss anymore!","I'm feeling the same way too, to be honest. I struggle with binge- eating disorder and I started lifting weights a few months ago and I really enjoy. It is really one of the only ways I like working out. When my college residence hall forced everyone to move out, I had to move back home with my parents and I think that is where a lot of my binging starts. The fact that I can't work out at the gym is giving me little motivation to continue eating clean and I have gained so much weight the last couple of weeks.",,,

31,05/08/2020,Strugglingwitheating,"So I've been in 'recovery' for a year and a half, kind of not trying my best and still holding onto small rules and rituals. I'm not proud of it and from an outsiders perspective, I seem pretty normal. I eat regular meals out, have many snacks and rarely do any type of exercise anymore. The only thing is is that I cannot physically stop myself from eating low-calorie option foods until I feel sick.
I live in an Asian household so we all share main dishes and take our own portions from the middle of the table.
It's just that I will get my portion, finish it before everyone else and then fill my plate up with another serving of a lower-calorie option and keep going until my stomach physically hurts.
I'm so sick of feeling so uncomfortable every single time I leave the dinner table and I hate it so much. Ever since recovery I have this mindset of 'oh there's only a little bit left might as well finish it' of my safe foods and then I take everything.
I really don't know what to do and I'm trying to remind myself that I shouldn't just fill up on that but I cannot stop myself
Sigh I'm just rambling now hopefully someone can relate :ppp","I relate to much of your post!!! Just today with one of my snacks, I had the mindset of “oh, there’s just a small amount left, I might as well finish it” but it turned out to be an among that made my stomach hurt from being too full yet I felt i had to finish all of it. The ED part of our brains are irrational and flare up at times, but the fact that you’re here posting your support shows that the recovery side of your brain is still fighting!","Reading your post was really interesting to me because I seem to have the opposite problem. Whenever there's only a little left I don't want to be the one to finish it, not matter if it's just my snack or a communal dish on the table. That is actually something my nutritional therapist has me working on-- finishing things. It can be almost painful to do so, but I am gaining a sense of strength in doing so. Perhaps you could make it a goal to not finish something. Can you maybe stop and take a deep breath and assess if you're full or just feel compelled to finish before you pick up the serving spoon. I have to take a breath and self talk to finish, so maybe you could use the same strategy not to? I don't know if it would work, but you could try serving sensible portions initially, eating more slowly, and then seeing how you feel...?
Thank you for this eye opening post and I wish you the best of luck.","Hi slamond. We edited your post to remove mentions of specific foods, which are not allowed on the forums.

32,05/07/2020,Copingwithweightgain,"Hey!So since this year( and specially quarantine)  started i've been trying to get rid of all my purging behaviors (with various levels of results.....) But that has made me gain a lot of weight ( and I wasn't underweight to begin with, nor am I overweight now, just on the other end of the healthy spectrum, I hope I am not violating any rules by saying this and I of course won't say any numbers)
Some days I feel great, but most days the self- hate is overwhelming. I'm a dancer, and (being on quarantine doesn't help) I've been slowly loosing motivation to take class and train my body, as I feel like I have nothing worthy to fight for, if that makes sense.
Also, if I was in a healthier miendset, at least I would have known it was for something. But I am on the same binge and restrict and purge cycle, just a lot heavier.
It has also made people not treat me as ""seriously"". My doctor doesn't care at all about it since I am not at a barely healthy weight anymore. I didn't ""look like I have an Ed"" ( whatever that means) before, but now even less.
I just feel alone, and sometimes wonder.if it's all worth it. Sometimes I just want to quit wanting to recover, to quit dance, to just quit my whole life and hide under my bed so no one has to see me like this.
I was wondering if anyone has any coping mechanism for when feeling down by weight gain??
Thanks to all!!
I really hope I didn't exceed any rules by saying this, I know it's a sensitive topic for a lot of us.","I don’t know if this is helpful, but I’ve been feeling some of that too so I’ll tell you how I’ve been thinking about it.I get that the weight gain doesn’t feel like it’s helpful, but I promise you it’s not for nothing — even if you’re still binging and purging just as much, it’s good to try and change your rhythm. That’s what I’ve been telling myself, anyway, and I think it’s real — gaining weight is part of the journey and even just trying to be okay with that is a huge step.The not-caring about training makes total sense — I’m a dancer/athlete too and I’ve definitely been feeling that. It’s been helpful to me to think remember what it is about dancing that I love, to really consider the possibility of letting it go and see whether or not that’s attractive. On the one hand it’s totally legit to let go of something like that as part of recovery, and on the other remember that this is quarantine and everything will be different (and hopefully better) when it’s over.I don’t know, these are just my thoughts. Don’t give up on yourself — you’re beautiful whatever you weigh and however much you’ve eaten. Society values thinness so much, but savor your solidity — it’s good to be full and earthly and take up space. I think about being curvy and womanly sometimes (I feel like solidity is a male characteristic too, but I don't have a good name), and that it's good to be filled out and have more than the bare minimum of flesh on your body. Mostly my coping mechanism is just trying to get that through my head.Okay I  know i just kind of spewed thoughts out but I hope some of it is helpful — I guess just hang in there because you are so worth it, and good luck :)","Honestly just knowing that someone understands what i'm going through makes me feel better. I actually saw your post and related so much that i had to comment, and now you are commenting on my post as well! I don't know if it's a coincidence or you saw it, but i can't deny our stories are pretty similar.
Again, thakj you so much for the support, i'm actually crying haha",,,,,,,,
33,05/06/2020,Iwassoclose,"I know everyone is struggling right now, and there's so much support on these forums and I'm grateful for that. I've only ever posted once before, but sometimes it gives me solace just to know that other people are struggling like I am and to see just how much love you all have for each other.I'm trying so hard to make quarantine a place for recovery, for really kicking the last bits of my eating disorder. And it's kind of almost working -- the last two weeks I felt pretty darn *normal* and that's very satisfying. But this week everything has been falling apart, and I'm so dissapointed with myself for not being able to make it. I haven't been this full in a long time, and I hate it, and I hate that it's so familiar it's almost nostalgic. I struggled with anorexia and now binge/purge cycles, and I'm terrified now that I'm getting better that I'm just removing the purge part and I'll never lose the weight I gain.I get to see my boyfriend every Saturday but he thinks I'm all 100% recovered, and I'm scared about how much I've been eating just this week and how much heavier I'll be this Saturday than last.I hate the way this feels, I hate how unhealthy it is, I feel like I'm taking days off my lifespan with every extra ounce of food that goes into my stomach. Usually after a bad day or two I can get back on the wagon but I've just been eating since Sunday and I don't know how to sanp out of it.Sorry if that's long -- I just wanted to tell someone, and this is the only place I feel like I can say the word ""binge"" without cringing. So thank you for that.","I understand how you feel. But recovery isn't linear, it has its up and downs. You may have been ""recovered"" for years, but have a few weeks where you fall off the wagon and binge or purge. I understand the feeling of not wanting to give in to food, it's frustrating. I have not felt as full as I am in a long time, and it's horrible, but I have to deal with it so I can live a long full life. It's hard to find the balance of how much food is ""maintaining your weight."" And it took me a long time to find it, but I finally did. Every week I just either ate more or less, or ate what I felt comfortable with, with 2 high-cal snacks.","Hey!! So i don't know if this is going to make you feel any better, but i really want you to know that i get you. Your story really resonates with mine; i also suffered from anorexia which morphed into bulimia, getting eventually worse and worse.
During quaratine i tried to drop all purging (since also being at home with my family makes ir even harder) and it has resulted in great weight gain, without actually dropping the disordered mentality at all.... It makes me feel like a failure all  the time.
But because it's always easier to give advice than to take it personally, i want to let you know that it's okay. Im not going to say that you probably didn't gain that much weight, or that you shouldn't feel that way about it. I just want you to know that you're not alone, that we can't be always at the top of our game, and that the people around us, like your boyfriend, understand that more than we think they do. They won't judge, the worst judge you can have is yourself.
I know how it feels to look in the mirror ( if you ever manage the courage to do so) and not recognize who you see. It's tough. To hate every single inch of you, and think you would give anything to go back in time to when you were ''skinnier'' even though at the time you felt just as bad. But i think wee need to give ourselves a break, because it's not fair to constantly think we are not doing good enough. Because we are. These circumstances are very hard, and the fact that you are even able to come to this forum and share your struggles means that you are trying. And that is good enough right now.
I am no expert, and probably my advice doesn't make any sense, but reading your story has really helped me, so thank you for sharing.",,,,,,,,

It means a lot in these weird times. My parents and I have a weird relationship. Anytime I've expressed mental health concerns to them in the past (anxiety) they've made sure to tell everyone and poke fun at it at large family gatherings, to teachers etc.. They also would constantly bring it up and resort everything back to ""oh you have anxiety"". At the end of the day I think any comments they make are out of concern, but in terms of my health care I really feel that the only way for me to get better is to not include them. They already make comments on my weight and food as It is, and when I ask them to stop or express frustration they just get mad.","That must make large family gatherings so difficult. It can be very difficult for parents to accept that their child is suffering with an eating disorder or a mental health problem, and I’m sorry they’re handling it this way. I’m sorry your teachers didn’t support you in this very difficult situation.
While it’s certainly not an excuse, sometimes, people deal with serious situations - such as illness or tragedy - by laughing at it. It can be a coping mechanism. It's a way avoiding that fear.
You haven't mentioned if you've had treatment such as counselling or other medical help for your situation. Six years is a long time - with or without professional treatment. You have said you don’t wish to include your parents in your healthcare. That is understandable. Are you able to seek out counseling without your parents? Maybe there’s internet-based counseling? It must be borne in mind that 'face to face' health services will be either unavailable or limited due to Covid-19. But talking with someone can help you understand your own condition and the reasons for it's origin, followed by working out a treatment plan. Maybe in addition to helping with your eating disorder, a counselor would be able to help guide you with your situation with your parents and any other people in your life whom you encounter either professionally or personally.","Hi PaulShipmanSmith - giving medical and/or psychological advice is not allowed on the forums (as per our Community Guidelines) and your post had to be edited. Thank you for your help in keeping our forums safe, kind, and compassionate and please continue posting!",Hi there.  I am really sorry to hear that.  It must feel pretty bad when that happens and to not feel you are able to trust them with important feelings and concerns you have must be painful.   I am really sorry.,That is a really tough spot.  I'm sending a big hug.  You don't deserve that.,"I totally understand how you feel, I feel like I wrote it. But in the end, I just have to remember that my family are trying their very best and I am grateful that they got me anything at all. I find a way to make the unwanted fruit work. Even though I am upset. A tip I use is that I write them a very VERY detailed list of what I want. I use brand name, describe how it looks, even include pictures",Sorry this is happening to you.I kept my ED hidden from my parents for six years then one night after drinking wine I just came out with it. They said they'd wished I'd told them sooner and that I shouldn't have kept it from them. It also matched up to what they feared about my eating habits and lower weight.You might find them a great resource at this time if you are able to share. Good luck
35,05/02/2020,Isolation&Injury,"My eating disorder started in middle school with excessive exercise. I won't go in to the whole exercise/diet/weight loss blah blah blah, but it was bad, and I got better. I gained all of the weight I had lost during this time, and then some. However, I never got the help I needed mentally, so I never truly recovered. Throughout high school, I struggled with my body-image and exercise addiction, but maintained a healthy weight (closer to overweight). I also started running cross country and track in 9th grade and have been running ever since.
     I am currently a sophomore in college and i love running. I have not run competitively since my freshman year of college xc season, so it has been about a year and a half, but I run on my own because I genuinely enjoy it. Running is how I de-stress, and balance my anxiety out a little. I don't enjoy the majority of my day and the highlight of my day is most definitely my time spent outside, putting one foot in front of the other, and re-charging.
     In January, I hurt my ankle while hiking with my brother. It hurt for a few days, so I managed to take that time off from running. Luckily, I was heading back to school so I had plenty of work and distractions to keep my busy. (I was also walking all around campus every day from class to class, so I could rationalize the exercise in my mind). My ankle has been randomly swelling up and bruising since January, but this past week it has gotten really bad and every time I step down on that foot, excruciating pain shoots through my foot and ankle.
     Now, more than ever, I need running. Being in quarantine, my running time is the only time I spend out of the house. My disordered mind is also still centered around my exercise, in order to eat. My whole day revolves around my exercise, calories burned and calories consumed. Without exercise, I am afraid I will either under eat because I haven't ""earned it"", or I will binge and gain tons of weight. I need running and exercise in my life for balance. I fear the elimination of exercise will make my disordered eating worse.
     I am not doing well and would love any support I can get. The only thing that makes me happy has been taken from me, and I am stuck in my house all day, every day. The fear of having to possibly take months or even longer off from running is escalating my anxiety a lot. My mental health is trash to begin with, but these new developments threaten to bring me to a new low I have not had to deal with since before I began competitively running in 9th grade.
     Also, for those wondering, I did not seek therapy until my freshman year of college. I made an appointment with the campus counseling center, but they said they could not help me, as they do not deal with eating disorders. I finally built up the courage to look for an off-campus counselor this past semester, and it took MONTHS to find someone with availability, who took my insurance, and was available when my friend could drive me. I saw her one time, the week before spring break. I made a second appointment with her, but when I was home for spring break, COVID-19 happened and we have not been back on campus since.
     I appreciate any and all advice and support because I feel extremely defeated and hopeless right now.","I don't really have any advice, but I definitely have support.  I have danced since I was three. And I am now 44. I adore exercising. I have belonged to gyms on and off for as long as I can remember. You name a cardio machine, and I love it. Right now I do not belong to a gym anymore and that happened before all of this started. I stopped belonging to it both for my health, due to the e.d. and for trauma-related issues.  But I have a treadmill at home and I use it everyday and I dance daily, too.  And exercise is my greatest stress reliever as well. So I totally get it. The times that I have been injured or ill, due to physical illnesses, I mean, it tears up my mental health horribly because then I feel like I do not have the right to eat. I feel like I have to burn enough calories in order to be able to consume calories first. I know that this is not logical. Because I know that we could be in a coma and still need to consume a certain amount of calories everyday. But I get from where you are coming because it is just the eating disorder mentality. So I do not have advice but I do give you my support wholeheartedly. And I am sorry that you're struggling with this.","That is exactly how I feel. Honestly, that's what I really need to hear. It's so crazy to find someone who can relate so much. It's hard not having any people in your life who understand, and it's hard to verbalize how you're feeling to someone who has never experienced these disordered thoughts.
Thank you for sharing!","Hi, I completely understand what you're talking about. I ran in high school and then competitively in college. Unfortunately due to my ED I spent a lot of time injured and was never able to reach my potential. Just to give you an idea of my age, I now have a son headed to the same college where I ran! Anyway, the first think I would like to say to you is that you is that you are doing a tremendous job of pursuing treatment under sub-optimal conditions. Similarly to you I didn't get adequate treatment in high school or college and I feel that during those formative years of the disorder, if I had really gotten treatment, I might not still be dealing with it. Please continue to chase proper treatment-- find that therapist who specializes in EDs and who can help you heal and recover. Maybe that therapist you met with before COVID is the right one-- can you reach out and connect with her? A lot of therapists are willing to do phone/ on-line sessions right now. Believe me, you don't want to fight this your whole life.Second, I understand how important running is to you. Although I absolutely cannot diagnose your injury, it sounds like it could be something that is serious or could become serious if you keep using it. Swelling and bruising and excruciating pain are all major signs that something is wrong. Get ice on that and stop using it until you can get it professionally assessed. You don't want to incur long term damage and potentially put yourself in a position where your ability to run in the future is compromised.
Good luck.","Thank you! I appreciate your advice. One of my biggest fears is struggling with this for the rest of my life. I wish I had gotten help back in middle school when I was actually underweight. Now, I don't feel physically sick enough for help, even though I'm probably in the worst mental state I have ever been. Its been so long at this point, it feels like my ED has stolen my childhood, and high school/ college experiences away from me. If it's already taken the best parts of my life away, what's the point in recovering now?",,,,,,

37,04/17/2020,AccessingtreatmentonMedicare/Medicaid,"Hi all. So...with all the changes I have been pleased to see that there are quite a few free options now virtually in terms of support that didn't exist prior to this pandemic. I'm still seeing many barriers for medicare folks depending on where we live. Have other folks been able to access treatment? (Especially in the case of only one or 2 places being successful for you and not being able to get into those) I see lots of virtual IOP being offered but folks who either need a higher level of care and won't be accepted into IOP or folks who don't live in states that have been approved for virtual IOP at a specific place....or seeing ""Only private insurance"" in those states...is anyone else experiencing this? How do we fight to take down these barriers? How do we get some actual action on this??! I'm sick of being treated like a second class citizen and being left out of options because of my insurance status.",We wanted to encourage you to reach out to our NEDA Helpline for additional support and resources. We have trained volunteers who can assist you with finding various treatment centers and options. You can call our helpline at 800.931.2237 M-TH 11am-9pm ET and F 11am-5pm ET. Additional you can chat with us online M-TH 9am-9pm ET and F 9am-5pm ET. We hope you find the support and resources you are looking for!,Thank you I've already done that.,"I also am Medicare/Medicaid, and haven't been able to access treatment other than the two inpatient units in my state. Always blows my mind that that's all they'll cover- I'd personally appreciate some preventative care and I'd think my insurance would appreciate saving a buck by covering basic treatment instead of repeated expensive medical care but... apparently not, lol. I've also been appreciating the support that's popped up in some places online due to COVID, but doubt it'll stick around.Wish I could be more encouraging... I've started relying a lot on peer support groups for people struggling with different mental health issues in my area which has been really helpful. Nice to have something in place that I feel like I can rely on long-term.",Yes....exactly! It's really hard to believe theres nothing else available. I have also just tried to patch together whatever I can. I wish there was better access and there was some kind of initiative we could start to advocate for this kind of access. Sigh...,I have this very same issue. You might consider reaching out to local programs and seeing if they will work with your insurance to create a single case agreement (SCA). The problem? Reimbursement rates are lower... There are some treatment centers that have scholarship opportunities as well. Calling or emailing a bunch of facilities can seem like a lot of work— especially if you’re not feeling so great—but it’s worth it if you can access care.,,,,,
38,04/22/2020,OUTOFCONTROL,"This is not a new topic per se. I saw many related posts to this but none of them fit exactly what is going through my head word for word. I am suffering from an eating disorder for almost seventeen years now. I have had brief, very brief, moments of recovery. Therefore, ultimately I have never actually been in full recovery before. At least not long enough to matter. I am a control freak as is everyone in my family. I just happened to be the best at being the worst within my household. Recently, amid COVID-19, I moved out of my parent's house and in with my boyfriend. We hoped that this move would make things better. It would ease some sort of something.
At home, I engaged in all behaviors and no one could stop me. I had immense amounts of guilt and shame. I still do and even being out of that house my mother constantly reminds me of what went down and it gets to me a lot. I know very well that I require a higher level of treatment. AKA Inpatient treatment. I have been in this position for a year and a half now. My insurance will now cover treatment but only in my home state because I am a too high risk to be on an airplane to go out of state anywhere or be a certain distance away from a major hospital.
I have gone way south in the past few weeks. And I mean WAY south. In and out of the hospital weekly. The only time my parents are involved now is when I need them. I feel ashamed every time I am brought through the doors of a hospital. My family thinks so highly of me right now, or so they say. I don't believe them entirely but they put on a brave face for me. I think we all know that I have some major issues going on. I have permanent damage that I have done to vital organs and body systems that I will never be able to get back. With COVID-19 everything is worse. I am sick a lot. I push myself to the brink, a lot. I AM IN DENIAL but I accept that.
When I am home, which right now is all the time, two days of the week I am all alone. My boyfriend works all day and I have to fend for myself. I can engage in behaviors all day. I am playing with fire but allowing myself to get burned and allowing my loved ones to watch. I cannot imagine just how painful it is for them.
I don't have a job or anything with which to occupy my time. I am alone mostly. When I am with my boyfriend it is hard because I feel like one giant light switch type trigger for him always on. He had an eating disorder too but is and has been doing well for years. We did not meet in treatment but were in treatment at the same time and in the same program just different facilities. I don't know how he does it. I know he struggles a lot and slips occasionally but he is my light. The only reason that I am alive. So when it comes to behaviors, we don't talk about them. I am pretty sure he knows. I know he knows. I just don't know how much he knows. But when I am with him, I switch gears and do the opposite.
I want to talk to him about all of this. I want to tell him everything because I love him and trust him and he loves me and I know it. But I am afraid of triggering him, being judged, being criticized within his mind but not out loud. Ultimately I am just a scared little girl. Plus it isn't as if I cannot see how bad off I am. I see myself as sick as I am. Coronavirus comes and hits home hard and everyone is scared for me. My father, a surgeon, terrified that his immunocompromised daughter is going to contract this deadly virus and die. What do I do about it? I don't take care of myself.
I try to keep myself mentally okay but I am finding it harder to do as the days go on. One thing that has always helped is movement, exercise, anything. I know for a lot of people that is a behavior but for me, it's a coping skill. When I was growing up I was a gymnast. A very high level, NO REGULAR SCHOOL- online school kind of gymnast. I had no life. But I trained many hours a week and competed and traveled on the weekends. I didn't care because I loved what I did. No one knew I had an eating disorder then. I am not proud that I am proud that I was able to cover that up. But it also kept my mind at ease enough to where I would allow some nutrition into my body and the exercise itself helped me on a mental level. Then I broke my back. I went full force into my eating disorder at that point. The whole reason I broke my back was from my eating disorder in the first place. Now I am stuck inside all day, every day and I don't have the energy to exercise any more or the fuel to do so. This doesn't mean I don't try. I try to keep up with my boyfriend or my father hiking but I just don't fit the bill anymore. How do I get in what I need when I am not strong enough to in the first place?
I'm spiraling out of control and I am not okay with that.
is a","Dear MM,Oh brother, I can understand why you are feeling distressed.  All these years of history, and now this.  In and out of the hospital a bunch of times recently : Shame shame shame !!  It can't be easy to feel even the slightest bit encouraged in the face of all this I know.   "" I AM IN DENIAL but I accept that.""I hope it's OK if I say this, as we don't really know each other, but….Oh baloney : You don't sound even slightly in denial to me.  To be honest, you sound pretty in touch with both yourself, and with your situation too.  I'm not sure if that's helpful or not, but for what it's worth, you don't sound deluded to me.  Which in the larger scheme of things might be a positive thing ?  You'll have to decide how to value that or not.""I try to keep myself mentally okay but I am finding it harder to do as the days go on. One thing that has always helped is movement, exercise, anything. I know for a lot of people that is a behavior but for me, it's a coping skill.""Yeah I know.  It's easy for people to think  ""Oh God, there she goes again with the exercise thing !"".  And I know you might kind of think that yourself.  But if it's keeping you sane, and you can *somewhat* keep from going overboard with it, given the current extraordinary circumstances…I'd try not to be too hard on yourself, even if these may have been destructive behaviors in the past.  Everyone else is trying to find ways to cope too, so I hope you can cut yourself some slack about this.  If you can do the ""not being so hard on myself"" thing I mean.  Being stuck inside alone like this, it's no picnic, that's for sure. Any normal person would look for ways to cope. So yeah ""being perfect"" or simply just ""being"" - It's gotta be a rough deal right now I know.I'm not sure how much luck you have with not being super self-critical, but this may be a time to try and experiment with that ?  I know, I know : Letting our guard down isn't going to feel like the right thing to do.  But what do we have to lose by trying ?I don't know your BF either, but its' possible that he'd be open to hearing your feelings. Maybe he wouldn't know what to do, any more than you or I do, but you never know.  I just know that keeping stuff in is probably not good for any of us.  Particularly during these circumstances, when a lot of us are feeling unsure.   It's possible that he's holding fears back that he'd want to talk about too.And you are right : perhaps some of those fears would have to do with you. Shame again, I know.   But you know, that's how it is with us human beings ; we do care about each other.  And it's not really that terrible of a quality.In any case, I'm glad you could write these things out.  I know it may feel odd having some stranger respond, but I just wanted to say that what you wrote... it all sounds very human to me.Which for all the strange and problematic ways that us humans can be…it's still OK to be human I think.   xx","Mmm! I totally hear you! I’ve been struggling for over two decades and I lost my job in early April. Being home all day with little structure is challenging. The quieter the room is, the louder the ED can seem sometimes. Exercise helps me cope too— to keep from worsening my condition, however, I now do my best to limit it. I walk outside for 20mins or so in the afternoon  and do a short yoga class (15-20 mins) online in the evening— I’d give you the link to the site I use, but I think it would violate the forum rules...  I am currently waiting to see whether I can obtain funding for treatment. My thoughts and urges are even more intense with this wait... In the interim, I’ve created a daily structure for myself— I find that it helps me to stay busy. Maybe think of something you’d like to learn and plan a specific time of day to work on it. Also... many treatment programs are transitioning to online formats. It sounds to me like you may not meet criteria for PHP/IOP, but something is better than nothing if you can access it. There are also lots of great recovery coaches who work remotely and might be able to assist you during this period. Hang in there and know that you’re not alone.",,,,,,,,
39,04/15/2020,It'shard,"My parents keep asking me if I'm ok and I say yes. I don't mean to lie to them, it's hard talking to my two therapists through Skype and not seeing them face to face. My older sister keeps yelling at everyone and I keep getting upset and trying everything to get my mind off of not binge eating. I hate myself and everything right now. Feel like it's never going to end. This is stupid and I'm sorry.","Its not stupid! This is such a crazy situation for everyone and you are not alone in finding it hard. I am sorry you are struggling, especially with therapy. I have been doing it through Facetime and its hard because it feels so much less private. But my therapist recommended a couple ways to help me feel more comfortable, so maybe if you explain how hard it is, they can offer a solution. Stay strong, hugs!",Thank you so much.,"I really feel you. Like in every way. I tell my parents I'm fine because I don't want to worry them, and to be honest, I have no idea how I would articulate how this feels; they just can't fully understand, not having dealt with it. I've also been working with my two amazing ED therapists through a video-app and feel like sometimes I don't even understand enough of what's going on inside myself to articulate it to them. They want to help, but I guess I'm still struggling with fully letting them in. And last thing we have in common: I ALSO have an older sister!! Mine tends to yell a lot too, especially when I tell her to chill. ;) Today was especially hard for me, which is how I ended up here. And I am so thankful I did. Your words really hit me, and I want you to know that I'm with you. I don't know when this-- this feeling, this pandemic-- will end. Not going to try to comfort you with an answer. I do want to share with you one of the most valuable things I've learned from treatment so far: if your mind is ON eating and you're fighting binges, that's your body trying to keep you alive & healthy by communicating to you that it wants food. EVEN if your hunger signals are crossed and you don't feel explicitly hungry, your body wants food. If you've been trying to restrict at all, your body knows. It's begging for a binge! The binge is not the problem-- the restriction is. The guilt is. I am in no way intending to give medical advice or control how you respond. You're a free person. I'm just saying that it feels f**king good to eat. It's scary, no doubt, but I choose to believe it's worth it. So, friendly and gentle reminder to keep eating, from someone who is struggling to take her own advice. But I am, I have been. In the last week, I've gone through a lot of food. It's difficult as hell, and I'm constantly scared of gaining weight. But I know my body needs it, and I'd rather deal with the MENTAL effects of gaining weight than be undernourished and lead my body to go into starvation mode, like it was doing for months and months. Plz plz consider reading a book that is slowly getting me through this pandemic. (I'm listening to the audiobook with the free audible trial). It's helping me like nothing and no one else could-- so validating and comforting. She is like my ED mom, if that makes sense. Lol. I'm with you, I'm thinking about you, and I appreciate you. Happy (and messy) eating to you.","Dear pjordner, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove the book recommendation and the specific mentions of food, which could be triggering to other users.

40,04/19/2020,Losingjobbringsuptrustissuesagain,"A major source of my eating disorder and depression is my issue with trust. Essentially, I believe and trust people to protect you and keep you safe, like a mother, who in my case failed to protect me and keep me safe. It's the aftermath of the lack of trust that begins to destroy me. I lost my job Friday from a private school and all the company who owns the school could tell me was ""due to unprecedented times""...
They rely on this pandemic to cover their failures. My husband works for an amazing company, the exception in a sea of companies only concerned with bottom lines and not people, despite what is written on their marketing materials. His company allows people to voluntarily self quarantine and still be paid, so I KNOW in unprecedented times, companies can take care of their staff.  My former company lied to us, saying since the initial outbreaks in February and March that we would be paid when schools closed and transitioned to online learning. Again, the familiar pain and anger of dealing with being lied to and the mistrust emerged. And utilizing a healthy way to deal with it is hard, especially when I won't receive a resolution or apology. And if I get that, will I feel better? How do you move forward? It is hard to have faith or see this as a blessing in disguise. What else can I do to feel happy again?","Hello.  I am really sorry you lost your job. That must be really difficult.  My sister just lost her job after thirty years working as a labor and delivery nurse.  It comes unexpectedly and just so difficult.  And add to that the deception that you are experiencing, the lies and the cover up that brings up things from your life story.  You say this is making it more difficult to deal with the eating disorder?  I know it is often said that eating disorders have to do with control and when things seem out of control the eating disorder flares up.  Is this happening with you?   How is your husband dealing with this?  Is he supporting you?  I hope so because it sounds like you really need that right now.  You mentioned maybe seeing this as a blessing?  May I ask in what way it may be a blessing?   In terms of moving forward, I think it is really important that you feel your feelings about this.  Feel them but don't get drowned by them.  Process what happened.  If you believe in Jesus, talk to Him about it, or to your husband or a friend.  If none of these work, journal.  After that for me, forgiveness is the way to move on.  Acceptance.  In DBT radical acceptance of what is or what happened.  This doesn't mean it was okay or that it was right, what happened, but just accepting that it did.  This can be a very difficult step to take but I believe it is very important in being able to let go of what happens that hurts us.  Then move on.  You may want to look at what happened again, but hopefully it won't hurt so much.  And it is okay to be angry or upset or feel betrayed.  Feelings are not bad.  They are real and an important part of recovery.Do you have support in dealing with the eating, and/or what you are going through?
I hope this was helpful and if not just know you are not alone.  iwanttolive","Hello, this sounds really difficult. There really is no correct way to precede, right now you just have to focus on staying healthy and recovery. Losing trust is a very hard thing to earn back, and I know how hard it is. It might be awhile before you feel happy,but you must trudge through the storm. Seek comfort from your husband and stay strong. This is going to be a tough time, but I know you can get through it",,,,,,,,
41,04/14/2020,Stockpiledfoodleadingtobingeing,"One of the ways I try to manage my bulimia is not having a large amount of food in the house at a time aside from things like cooking ingredients. I usually go to the grocery store daily or every other day instead, so if I feel the urge to binge I have to actually leave the house and it's a bit more difficult than just walking to the kitchen. But at the moment, I'm quarantined with my roommate who is also stockpiling food, and I'm both bingeing on my food and his, because he has (a large amount of) food that I generally wouldn't be around at all because it triggers a binge. One of my other main methods for cutting down on bingeing is when I feel an urge, I go do something out of the house, active, and distracting- nothing else has worked to help prevent bingeing.
Does anyone have any advice for this? I guess the social distancing won't go on forever so there might be a natural end to this dilemma, but I just hate the amount I'm bingeing right now.","I have experienced the same thing. I too avoid keeping a lot of food in the house to avoid the temptation, and quarantine has been difficult. I have thrown myself into a deep cleaning and reorganizing of my house over the last few days and have not had as many urges. For me, I just have to keep busy. Once I stop, my mind races and it always leads me to bingeing. I’m not sure what I’ll do once the cleaning is done. Wish I had more advice to offer, but am struggling to paddle this boat too. Stay in there!",Cleaning and reorganizing is a great distraction - thank you for the advice!,"Hi ficus_Iyrat. I'm really sorry that you're having to go through this. I too am really struggling, although I don't purge after (I either eat a lot less for days after or I excessively workout). I literally just had a binge episode where I baked a dessert and pretty much ate them all and I now feel like I'm going to explode.
Something that sometimes helps for me in reminding myself is writing in sharpie on my hand... which I'm going to try now for tomorrow and remaining days (I suppose we aren't seeing anyone, right?). Another thing that has worked for me in the past is sticky-note reminders. I get that you have a roommate and so that might not be feasible. I have a boyfriend who I live with and I don't even feel comfortable to post sticky-notes places.
Something that will always work for me IF I am disciplined enough to do it is to play some music! The TV does not help. My phone does not help. If you have some songs that make you happy or sad, listen to them. I'm not sure about you, but I have never been able to binge when listening to some good music. I turn it off to feel worse about myself. Then again, this will only work for me if I am disciplined enough to turn it on in the first place.",,,,,,,
42,04/13/2020,Losingcontrolathome,"I've been back home from college for about a month now, and it has really been impacting my recovery efforts. Obviously my parents want me to recover, but i feel as though I have more control over my behaviors and recovery goals at school, without the watchful eyes of my whole family who is aware of my past with disorders. I've definitely relapsed a bit, but they still don't know. I am trying to find motivation to recover and maintain recovery again, but I feel as though part of the reason its so hard is that I am inside indefinitely, and I feel as though I have plenty of time to hide away in my own problems. This has basically just led to me going back to past behaviors after my parents go to sleep, since I'm in college and can use the excuse of staying up late to work. I am really starting to hate these behaviors and the fact that sticking to recovery is so hard. I reaallllyyyyy want to be healthy and recovered, but being at home is posing new challenges. I am also way to scared to turn to them for help, since my siblings also are struggling with issues such as depression and early signs of alcohol problems, which is taking up my parents time/worry. I'd hate to add to it, but I know that doing this behind their back is so toxic for us all. :(","Hey collegekid, I am in a very similar position. Was living in a dorm for over a year, really enjoying the indepdendence and control, and now my parents are worried about my low weight and are monitoring my food intake. They think they're doing a good thing but they don't realise they may be pushing me into a full-blown ED. I am not sure if you can PM on this website, but if you can, please feel free to contact me directly and we can support each other. No time like the present situation to lean on someone's virtual shoulder <3",we can only reply on here.,"The fact that you are really aware of what's happening is good-- it means you're not in denial and you are prepared to fight for your health. If I were you, I would tell your parents that you are finding the situation difficult. If you can give them any specific ways to support you, tell them. It will be much harder if you don't have specific ideas for them. Do you have a therapist you see? Is there a way you can do virtual sessions? It sounds like some outside support might help too. I am sorry this is a difficult time for you and I applaud you for trying to focus on your recovery despite the situation. Good luck!",,,,,,,
43,04/16/2020,LiterallyJustSpiralling,"I literally don't even know what to write but my mind is spiraling and I don't want to bother my frineds/family because this is all so stupid but I'm literally losing my marbles.COVID-19 SUCKS. And I HATE complaining because I live in a stable house and I'm provided for and there are so many people who are in situations so much worse than my own.But I am literally just stuck in my mind all day long. I have NO motivation to do anything, I just sit in my bed and oh my goodness do I SNACK. I don't think I realized how amazing college has been at forcing me into a structure that allowed me to have my anxiety and ED under control and now I'm just spiraling. There is SO much I could be doing with my time; I have always been such a busy person and now you would think I would cherish this free time to get ahead and do the things I've never had time to do but instead I'm just constantly thinking about food and my body and of course that just spirals out into everything. My life, school, my future, my friends, my family... literally everything. And I don't know how to make it stop. I am trying to just keep reminding myself that this is permanent. That I have so much to be thankful for. But ugh its so hard and I just wanted to rant over this for a bit because I really don't get to talk about my ED with many people. I've been ""recovered"" for a few years and so the issues aren't really huge, just normal anxiety... but this quarantine has really amplified them and I'm really struggling.Hope you all are doing alright :) <3 I send my love and support to everyone, no matter what your situation is.","Thank you for talking out how this pandemic makes your feel. Reading your post made me feel like I'm not alone in this!

I've struggled with ED in the past, and I thought I was done with it but its here and I'm scared again. I also took for granite how the structure of college really helps.

44,04/14/2020,Relapsinginisolationduetomovingbackwithparents,"Hi I had an ED (Anorexia Nervosa) when I was 15 (now 23). I have struggled with body dysmorphia ever since (I never got therapy), but I controlled my eating habits well and didn't fall back into anorexia. I have been living out of home in a dorm since Feb last year. Life was good, I definitely did relapse a little bit but nothing severe. I tried to conform to normal mealtimes, I was restricting (but that's how I've lived since I was a child, I do not like eating breakfast as I have IBS and breakfast upsets my stomach a lot, I also don't wake up hungry), drinking decaf coffee, having other staff instead of real food as post-class but pre-dinner snacks, watched calories on things I bought, etc. It sounds disordered on one hand, but on the other hand it didn't really affect me. It was a long term change. I just learned to have lunch, dinner, and not buy sweets. Food wasn't as available as normal and I was more preoccupied living out of home, so even before I started restricting at all, I was eating a lot less and losing weight. This always happens during times that I am busy/happier, I shed weight as when I am happy and preoccupied I forget food being an existence (in fact, when I was a young child I didn't feel the need to eat at all, only because I felt it was a waste of time alongside more fun activities, and was taken to several docs about this). I should mention I didn't visit my parents as often as I could have since I didn't want to gain weight by going there. When I moved out of home I was on the low end of normal weight. Gradually my weight dropped and I stabilised around borderline underweight. My weight has not gone above this weight since I moved out. I obsessed about my weight a fair bit in the dorm, particularly as I didn't have a scale. I was worried I was constantly gaining weight, but at the same time, if we had parties etc., I would eat food unrestricted. But the food I chose for myself was always low fat, and I am not a picky eater so it didn't really affect me. I felt I was eating to live, eating was a nuisance amongst everything I needed to do.
I thought I would gain weight this year, as it is a stressful year of placement. Instead, I have been dropping weight and am now quite underweight. I thought I'd gain when I had to move back home when isolation started a month or so ago. Instead I dropped more. At this point I was actually trying to eat more and put on weight. My parents picked up on it a few days ago, and my dad got extremely angry at me (he has chronic severe anger issues), told me it was my fault etc., and is now monitoring me like a hawk and taking control of what I eat and when. He asks me what I ate all the time, he criticises what I am eating. I feel constantly judged.
This has unfortunately been extremely triggering. Now I can't stop thinking about food, my weight, I panic at the feeling of hunger, I don't eat even when I am hungry. My eating was disordered before but it wasn't this bad. My dad's attempts to help have stripped me of control and actually triggered me to go back to a mental state I avoided so well for so long. Yes I restricted food out of home, but I never felt panicked about it, usually it was just a ""Oh I am hungry I will just finish this and then go eat"" not a ""oh I am hungry this is terrible I better just hold it out and not eat because otherwise I will gain weight""... Essentially my dad has made me hyper-conscious of what I eat, which is the exact thing that I have worked so hard for the past 8 years to get rid of. I am terrified of binge eating disorder, I am terrified of gaining weight. This morning I read the weather was warm, I was afraid to wear shorts, afraid to walk around with a figure I assumed was fat due to being on a forced weight gain diet now. Weighed myself, gained a tiny bit, sure, but still very underweight. If I feel fat at this weight, how will I ever be fine with myself in a higher weight again. I will probably fall into a depression and a panic and overeat.
Anyone in this position right now?","those things are not allowed on this site.  They will be deleted.   They are triggering to others.  Plus, there is really no need for numbers.  I would suggest seeing a medical professional, doctor, therapist, and psychiatrist to help you.","Dear Mollydolly432, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove weight, BMI and height numbers as well as mentions of specific food items, which are not allowed on the forums.

45,04/13/2020,DepressionandIsolation,I’m feeling really depressed today. It’s so hard being isolated from others. I haven’t been able to get out of the house much lately because of the stay at home order. It’s also been hard to eat. I’m wanting to restrict. Today has been especially hard. I feel worthless.,"I'm sorry you are feeling like this. I know how you feel and I have found what helps me is to keep busy and create a routine. Even if you think it's pointless, taking time out for yourself like having a shower and reading a book can really help. I'm also isolated because of what is going on and being stuck with your own thoughts can make it more difficult to maintain healthy habits. I believe in you to keep strong but just remember you are not worthless, this stressful time will pass and you will be so proud of yourself for getting through it.",I appreciate your response. I went on a short walk in my neighborhood this afternoon. It helped some.,"Hi blue 44. I'm so sorry that you're so isolated and feeling so discouraged and depressed. I understand but not completely because I'm with family and my sister and my roommate. Although my sister is in isolation in a bedroom at my parent's house. This is a tough time.  That's when we need to really press into Jesus because He is always with you, He'll never leave you and He understands more better than anyone.  I just encourage you to take a walk when you can and when you're feeling up to it. I am sitting out on  my front porch.   I had to get a new phone because I dropped mine and broke the face. This phone has speech to text so I have to be very careful what I say and  need to proofread what I speak otherwise I might send something that I really don't want to. I also had to get a new laptop because mine broke but it was able to get the information transferred onto the new one before the old completely broke. But that's besides the point. I am glad that you're reaching out for support and know that you're not alone even though you are physically alone, you have people that care  and a community on this form that cares. I know it's not the same as tangible bodies.
Our routines  are not the same, and this too is challenging.  But just hang in there my friend. We're here for you, I'm here for you just just take it one day one moment at a time.I just said one woman at a time instead of one  moment at a time which is why I have to be careful to proof before I send it. So for now take care I look forward to further chats.iwanttolive",Thank you for your encouragement. I really appreciate it. I’m feeling a little better than I did earlier today.,"I have found neighborhood walks really helpful too. Just getting outside for a little while and getting some fresh air seems to improve my mood. I have no agenda on my walks and just let my mind wonder. Sometimes I think about ""difficult"" things, like how the ED is such a big part of my life, and other times I just look at trees, etc. I am glad you found some solace in that as well. It's a good way to sort of ""reset.""",No profound words.  Just wanted to let you know that I'm here for you.  <3,I feel very anxious. I’m feel bad about myself because I took more than my dose of anxiety pills last night. I also barely ate breakfast.,,,

48,03/28/2020,Grief,"My grandmother just died. It wasn’t expected because the freaking nursing home never called to say she was declining.
On top of depression and ocd symptoms having been ramped up already, I feel so much shame and guilt for not going with my dad to visit her that often. I wasn’t as close with her as I was/am with my moms parents. I feel like a horrible person. I don’t really feel distraught, which also makes me feel like a horrible person. I kind of just feel detached from anything. Like my depression makes me feel, but even more so. I haven’t called my best friend in over a week or reached out to anyone but I just can’t seem to stop this downslide. Even more so now. I know I should reach out to my psychiatrist to tell her that my OCD symptoms are still getting worse so she can increase my antidepressant like we previously discussed, but I can’t even get myself to care enough about my well being to do this.","I’m sorry to hear about your grandmother. I remember when my grandmother died, I felt a lot of guilt and shame around not visiting her more. It was a difficult time in my life to be close to her, because I was struggling with my own ED and anxiety at a very severe level. You cannot blame yourself for distancing others when you yourself are sick and hurting, it’s a part of the disease. I know how triggering this must be for your depression and ED, and all I can say is to keep taking steps forward. Do the next right thing, even if it sucks. It’s so hard to get the motivation to care for yourself when you’re grieving, know that it’s a normal part of the grieving processes. You can do this, and never blame yourself for the death of a loved one in times like this, or ever.","Dear tryingtobebrave – we are so very sorry to hear of your loss. Know that you are not alone during this time. You mentioned some worrying feelings, and we wanted to make sure to post information about resources if you need support: Take care of yourself and please do not hesitate to seek help. A list of resources specifically for COVID-19 can be found here – you are not alone.",Wrong thread - sorry!,"I'm sorry about your grandmother truly, but I know you cared for her. You don't have to feel like you didn't care just because your not as upset as you think you should be. It could be the shock, or maybe you had already accepted it because you knew she had lived a good life and it was her time. But I do think its a good idea to talk to the psychiatrist. Things must be very hard for you right now, there is no need to feel ashamed to get the help you deserve.",,,,,,
49,04/01/2020,ParentThreats,"I have still been working at my job even with all this going on. I work at a fast-food place, and it may not be always fun, but it's keeping me sane through all this, giving me a sense of purpose. And now my parent wants to take it away. He wants me to quit, and I understand he's worried, but i'll go insane! And not only that, I pick out my own groceries, and now he doesn't want me to go. I don't know how I will cope if I can't control the food that comes into the house. This is so stressful and I just want it to be over.","Since you said you can understand why your dad feels that way, Could you maybe have a conversation with him asking him  Why he doesn't want you to work anymore and why he doesn't want you to go to the grocery store?  Maybe you could work out a compromise. I'm not sure about the fast food restaurant thing. Depends what his reasoning is. Because I know most places around here are only doing the drive-thru. So it's not like you're having contact with very many people if that's the case. But with the groceries, maybe he would be okay with you ordering your own groceries online. That way you would stay safe. But you still would have control over getting your own groceries. Just an idea and that way you both have a little bit of control. I hope this helps and I hope that you are able to still get through this. Hang in there. I'm here for you.","I am still working too and I see a spectrum of reactions to working/not working during this time. I have been mandated to provide child care for first responders by the governor since I work at a school. Personally, I am so thankful to be working and getting out of the house and not having so much time to get overwhelmed by my thoughts. I completely agree with you that it's good for sanity. It also provides some income, some appropriately distant socialization, and a way to not let yourself become over absorbed in your ED. Perhaps if you talk to your dad and explain to him what befits you feel you are getting from your job and what precautions you are taking, you could allay his fears? I would say the same with the store-- go over what precautions he would like you to take at the store to make him feel comfortable with you going. A mask? Gloves? I don't know what your relationship with him is, but I hope it's open enough that you can have a frank discussion with him about the stress and anxiety you are feeling and that you are open to working something out that you can both be ok with. Good luck.",,,,,,,,
50,03/27/2020,Anxious,It feels so anxiety producing to not be able to do all the every day stuff.  Plus it feels like it will never end.  It makes me want to disappear.,I also have a lot of anxiety. This virus is making my anxiety even worse. Staying isolated is very hard.,"Hey you guys.   Yep, it's stressful for me too, and is probably the most difficult for those of us who live alone.  No one is comfortable with this sort of uncertainty, that's for sure, so I don't think it's proving anything particularly negative about us if we feel ill at ease.Day by day, that's what it's going to take I think.  Along with the realization that a lot of humanity is in the very same boat, and that we really aren't quite as alone with this as it sometimes feels.  xx","My panic broke yesterday after coming on here. it did reoccur today and will probably tomorrow but we have to just take each day as it comes as everyone else is right now. I'm looking forward to a bike ride for exercise and to get essentials tomorrow and as its near a vast beach I may go early in the hope its unpopulated. I am finding positives for instance, the great thing this lockdown situation is for nature, I am reveling in the abundance of wildlife that I'm seeing. What silver linings do you look to x","Hi everyone.  It is so interesting that during this time of isolation, as we may have been exposed to the virus and nothing being open anyway, that my roommate and I are spending a LOT of time together.   We are having meals, today I made breakfast for us, and working on a project together.  She is used to being out a good part of the day so for these two weeks that we have been together we have taken walks in our backyard, we have a beautiful brook, and just spending time together.  There is no tension and we are laughing and praying and have sorrow all at the same time.  For me, I am learning how to trust God like never before.  I have been in isolation for three weeks.  Hopefully we will find out if my sister has the virus tomorrow and if she doesn't I can go back to work.  I am a home health aide and want to be doing what God has called me to do, even with the concerns of the virus. I just can not go into the nursing home right now.  So between trusting God and laughing even though I am scared.
I have been eating too much at night.  Late at night too.  I need to stop this behavior.  When negative thoughts come, because they do, I am learning to pray, use skills and force my mind to think of something else.
I am glad that we are sharing here and and pray for us all.iwanttolive","I’ve been having a lot of anxiety too, that feeling of being trapped really gets under my skin. My OCD symptoms and intrusive thoughts are a lot worse, I get distressed over stupid things like asking everyone to wash their hands after they handle the mail.

I’m grateful I can at least have a telehealth visit with my therapist on Monday, and may reach out to my psychiatrist about adjusting my medication for ocd.

52,03/31/2020,Tele-health,"I have been telling myself that this entire COVID-19 thing and the various stay-at-home orders really are not affecting me too terribly. And for the most part, that's true. I am not one to panic. And I know that this is fulfilling Bible prophecy, so it's not really bothering me, in that regards. I also tend to be a homebody, while also being an on-the-go person even though that sounds very contradictory. :-) Recently, I had had a lot of physical problems, and for the past 3 months, I've kind of been at this similar stage of isolation that we are all facing. The part that IS starting to bother me now, is the Telehealth thing with my therapists.  I am not exactly keen on having to do therapy over my dinky pathetic little camera on my phone. Especially when my phone is pretty stinky in the first place. I hate technology. It never seems to work properly for me. But especially since everybody is having to rely on it like crazy right now, the four times that my two therapists have tried to use the system for doing our sessions, they have failed miserably. (The systems, not my therapists.)  And today, was the absolute worst. We spent at least  half an hour just trying to negotiate two different apps to try to figure out how we were going to talk and see one another. And even when we tried the second app, even though we could both see one another, we could not hear each other very well. So he had to call me on the phone, while keeping up the video from the app. And this drained my phone's battery life like crazy. A side note, I only have my phone for any internet connection. I do not have a computer or tablet or anything like that. So I feel like my therapy sessions are being wasted on technological difficulties. I know they are as frustrated as I am. And I know there is really nothing any of us can do about it.  And it still does not make matters any simpler. And then to make matters worse, once we did at least get a working system going today, we talked about some things for about 10 minutes probably, which then triggered me into going into a dissociative flashback. Fun!! Not! And that took up the rest of the session. So, like I said, I really feel this entire session today was completely wasted. And the majority of the reason was because of the COVID-19 restrictions that we are all facing. So yeah, I guess I am feeling a little frustrated about all of this. For the most part, it's not bothering me too much, in my regular life, for my day-to-day activities. But when it comes to my therapy, yeah, it's really messing up everything.","I soooo relate to what you said. I too am usually a homebody due to physical issues, but having to use telehealth is a challenge. Even just the fact that we can’t be in the therapists usual room is hard, we weird as that sounds. I know it’s not the same. I can’t do much trauma work beyond saying what I’m thinking/ feeling and cementing coping skills. I don’t like it.
The one other thing is I really miss seeing my best friend. The one thing I got out for socially once a week was seeing him. Even in my darkest times, just spending time together was keeping me going. He understands and I don’t have to pretend to be okay. We can just sit in silence and know we’re not alone sometimes. We could go out to breakfast and I could be present without ed thoughts. With my mental state being so erratic, I’ve been a bit self destructive in isolating myself without reaching out. I’m going to make a conscious effort to call him tomorrow. Hugs and love",I haven’t been able to have a session with my therapist in several weeks because of the virus. A phone session is an option but I don’t have privacy at home so I haven’t scheduled a session. My husband works from home a lot and my three children are home also. I feel so isolated and I really miss therapy. I really need to see my therapist because I’m struggling.,"i had one session with my pyschiatrist/therapist over the phone and it felt really weird.
