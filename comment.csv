I had my growth spurt really early and hit puberty at a similar kind of time, I was about 10, which meant that I was always bigger than my friends (obviously, at 5ft 8in with boobs and hips starting to happen, I was obviously going to be bigger, even just in the hips and shoulders, than my 4ft 6in friends). As a result, I slouched a lot because I was very self-conscious about being literally head and shoulders above everyone else. I also had to start shopping in the adult sections of shops, which was a bit of a shock. So, I started having issues with food around this time, but I was also quite lucky that I had the metabolism of youth and the energy to do a fair amount of sport. I also walked to school, walked into town to meet friends and went for walks with my family at the weekends.

I got my first job at 17 which was in a restaurant. I walked about 40 minutes each way to work and back, was on my feet all day at work and I worked through mealtimes so, on most days, I would have a meal before I left for work and maybe a small snack when I got home, but this was usually after my family were in bed, so I had to be super quiet and often had just a glass of lemonade and a couple of cookies. Around this time, I also dated a guy who literally never fed me, as in I would go over to his after work one night, stay for my day off and go home that evening or the following day, and I would pretty much only eat if I ordered a pizza or something (which was not often). It was a bad relationship and he did not get on with his family so I spent most of my time in his room and he would leave to go to the bathroom, come back half an hour later, having had something to eat while he was downstairs and never offered me anything. I was severely underweight at this time, but I wasn't even trying to lose it. I loved how it made me feel though. I was confident, I could wear anything with no risk of looking fat, it was great.

I think this has just broken my relationship with food. I restrict almost constantly, exercise heavily if I feel like I'm not restricting enough (or if I'm not hungry because that means I must have eaten too much), I feel tremendously guilty if I eat something I consider ""naughty""...

honestly i have no experience with binge eating so i can't say much. i'd say whether that's a diagnosable issue depends on how much you consume in one time and how often it happens. the feeling bad part, both physical and mental, well, a lot of people feel like that.

- being able to actually enjoy food without anxiety/fear. Food is such a social thing; I‚Äôve been quiet or held back or completely missed experiences because of food. 


- being able to hold conversations with people and connect with them instead of losing focus.


- not spending your day thinking about food/when or what you‚Äôll eat. There is so much more to life and I‚Äôve missed out on so many beautiful experiences worrying about food or my body. The months/years that I‚Äôve woken up to food &amp; planning when/what I‚Äôll eat that day as my first thought is so fckin depressing.


- being able to have deep, meaningful relationships. When I‚Äôm deep in my ED, I isolate myself and the few friends I talk to I‚Äôm too exhausted to fully and truly connect with. 


- being more than your eating disorder. I‚Äôm kind, charismatic, bubbly, and outgoing. My eating disorder stole this from me and made me a shell of this person..It made me selfish and i don‚Äôt recognize myself 


- to finally live. The earth is so fckin beautiful and I‚Äôve missed out on so many opportunities to see it because of this horrible disease. 


Lastly:

Think about the happiest moment of your life. Just do it - think about when you were truly happy, laughing - maybe with friends/family, over the holidays, or by yourself reading a favorite book/exploring that new place in town.

You also need to communicate with your daughter. Do not pressure her or you will only make things worse. You can‚Äôt be direct and you can‚Äôt mention weight or looks. Ensure the conversation is entirely about health. It can even be about ways to stay fit with regular eating and exercise. Talk about how the existing habits she has are unhealthy and why. But also ensure you are finding replacements for those habits. 

Example: Eating once a day can slow down your metabolism and cause you to feel tired and weak. Eating an unbalanced diet (like junk food pizza rolls) are EMPTY calories that do absolutely nothing for your body or health. There is little to no nutritional value to fuel your body or mind. Junk food has preservatives that your body cannot digest easily, meaning the food will sit in your stomach longer than it needs to and become fat in the body. An alternative would be eating lots of healthy snacks throughout the day. Fruits and veggies can be prepared in a wide variety of ways that can be appealing and fuel your body and mind effectively.

If it helps you at all, Ive worked in multiple fast food places for years and workers DO NOT ever ever ever intentionally switch non-diet with diet and vice versa. 

The reasoning that if the employee did so and the customer had a serious health concern (say diabetes or allergies for example) the company can be sued to hell and back. They dont want that and it is prohibited in every place Ive ever worked. Even janky fast food places strictly adhere to food safety regulations or theyd go out of business like that.

 It does not generally happen and the incidents that do happen make it to the news for the rarity/extreme cases when it does. Odds are strongly in your favor they wont dare put regular instead of diet soda. Your family may accidentally mix up an order when handing it to you but employees are supposed to push in the lid tabs button thingy whether it's diet/soda/water to be sure. 

I am super familiar enough with the taste of sodas to tell if it was artificial sweetener, and taste a sip as a last resort... the artificial taste tends to linger and has a particular flavor compared to sugar. You dont need much to tell either so one sip won't do a thing. At home I have cases upon cases of diet sodas of all sorts.

She basically explained it like this (I‚Äôm oversimplifying to get to the point): ED behaviors are like coping mechanisms for whatever perceived threat or trauma we are dealing with. It‚Äôs really scary to just rip that away without replacing it with actual healthy coping mechanisms. For example, maybe you used your ED to numb difficult emotions from toxic relationships. If you remove the ED behaviors without first learning how to set boundaries in relationships or deal with your emotions, then you‚Äôre going to feel a lot worse. 

She also used an analogy of getting caught in a river where the current is really high and you can‚Äôt swim. The current (your real life problems) is difficult to navigate, and then a log floats by and you cling to it to save you (the eating disorder). Later on, you get to a part of the river where you may be able to swim to shore (recovery), but you‚Äôre not sure you can just let go of the log and make it that far. So instead you practice floating and treading water by the log, and practice swimming laps around it (slowly using healthy coping mechanisms) until you‚Äôre more confident that you can let go of the log and swim to the shore. 

That might be a little cheesy, but that story always stuck with me, so I thought I‚Äôd share. Learning how to take care of yourself in healthy ways and finding out what the source of your problem is will be essential to do because in a lot of cases, that‚Äôs what your ED was doing for you.

A bumped up creatinine can be something as simple as dehydration. It can mean something other than dehydration. There is much, much more to diagnosing kidney injury/disease than just creatinine. Also, levels matter here. For instance, an elevated creatitine of 1.3 means something much different than a level of 5. Results of other lab work paired with it matters, urine studies matter as well.

I know it's frustrating to wait for your doctor to get back to you, but they have all your info and are the only one who can say what significance this level has. One lab value can't tell you much here.

It sounds like perhaps you are obsessively exercising because it feels like the only thing you can control, which is something I do a lot of when I get stressed or anxious. It's not always a problem if you do exercise a lot, but you need to make sure you are eating enough, particularly focussing on protein to protect your muscles. Perhaps, if eating doesn't appeal to you, try smoothies and protein shakes to make sure you get some nutrition (you can always add a little bit of protein powder to smoothies and other food if drinking it doesn't work for you - I find them quite powdery so mixing some into a pasta sauce or curry hides the texture quite well). You don't always have to have proper meals either - you can try having more smaller snacks, like yoghurt, nuts, fruit and protein bars. This might make you feel better because you won't be eating a full meal, rather eating smaller amounts more often.

I think you should also focus on ways to manage your anxiety. I know that's a lot easier said than done, but maybe there's people here who can help with tips they use. I find that I feel a lot calmer on days that I do yoga or even just a bit of meditation - it seems to settle me.

[],,BasiliskFangness,,,[],,,,text,t2_11hfer,FALSE,FALSE,[],"As a stranger on the internet, I am in absolutely no position to tell you what to do with your life. But as someone who has been in your shoes, I feel compelled to ask that you please end your relationship.

I stayed with someone for years despite repeated incidents of him cheating on me. I've struggled with eating disorders and my appearance since I was about 12, and still struggle now in my 20s. In all these years, nothing exascerbated it as badly as being with someone who had cheated on me for all those years. It's single handedly one of my biggest regrets.

With every woman he had cheated on me with, there was some excuse. She had something that I did not. One had a smaller waist. One was built like a proper model with a flat stomach. One had larger breasts. None had an overbite like I did, or the acne. He never said it out loud but I would just know the reasons why she was more beautiful. Even though we were ok for a while, I couldn't look at other women he interacted with the same way. I would see reasons why they were ""better"" and why I wasn't good enough. I loved him dearly. In fact, I was so sure I'd be spending the rest of my life with him. I'd sacrificed a lot to be with him as we were high school sweethearts. I spent years trying to be better in order to be good enough that he wouldn't cheat on me again.

The breaking point was something that, to me, was far more extreme than him cheating. People who cheat in a relationship are people that indulge in their own narcissistic tendencies. They are toxic regardless of how nicely they treat those around them. That toxicity will eventually rear its ugly head. For some, it will be through substances like alcohol or drugs. For others, it will be through opportunity. In the case of my ex, he made me choose between him and a suicidal friend that needed my support. Incidentally, I love my friends more than I love myself, and refused to bend to his whims. When I chose my friend, he used it as an excuse to cheat on me.

""Why should I choose you over her when you didn't choose me over him?""

That was his excuse, and that was my breaking point. I had left him, but I was also lost. I had no self-worth, no confidence in myself, and no love for myself. I was still comparing myself to everyone else, and I found myself in a number of life-wrecking relationships afterward. In retrospect, I realized I had stayed in a toxic relationship long enough for it to change my world view for the worse. Even in the relationships succeeding it, I was comparing myself to other people and singling out people I foresaw my partners cheating on me with. My eating disorders worsened, I became an alcoholic, and my depression hit a new low.

While the story of a stranger may mean absolutely nothing, I do hope you can see some parallels in your life. I hope you can learn from my mistakes before making any of your own. I hope you find happiness and peace in a relationship that makes you confident in yourself and the love you have. At 25, I am still struggling but I am not struggling alone.

Love that is unconditional will never breed insecurity.",,,1609637069,{},ghvvvdy,FALSE,t3_kp6tar,FALSE,TRUE,t3_kp6tar,/r/eating_disorders/comments/kp6tar/wanting_to_relapse_after_my_bf_cheated_on_me/ghvvvdy/,1609639576,3,TRUE,FALSE,eating_disorders,t5_2zzq8,,0,[],

The progress was great I didn‚Äôt lose much but I did lose some and 8th grade I found ED tumblr
I know I had no one to ‚Äúlove‚Äù intimately when I was a kid bc I was a fat while everyone who was small and popular had people. This dude told me my fingers smell like chili (they didn‚Äôt it‚Äôs cuz I was fat)
HS came the bullying was still there when I tried to balance on a chair squatting a few kids in my class teased my tummy. I wanted an ED so bad and I remember one time this kid after school made w fat joke so funny even my friends laughed that was the breaking point I ran to the restroom and sobbed about wanting to take the ED seriously. Id lash at my mom saying it‚Äôs her fault I was fat. She helped me diet she wanted the best for me but she didn‚Äôt know it was just giving in to the ED. I did the doctor diet again and had restrictions occur. I developed fear foods and stuck to healthy food only. Progress cane yay. The baggy clothes fell and I got cute ass fits BUT BUT as the weight dropped the person in the mirror grew. Body dysmorphia was bad bad. I cried so much and my only thought revolves around food. Commercials began to break my heart. I found a new diet I will not name from this instagram who sold the product and it helped! I lost 15 lbs in 2 weeks, 2 lbs a day. I loved the diet so much I stuck to it for a year... the dizzy spells fuck. I‚Äôd cry when I ate chicken nuggets or cookies and try to spit it out and sob hard I couldn‚Äôt even eat what I enjoyed. The laxatives also took a toll on me. Eventually I began to eat and fell in love with food all over again. It was beautiful but I never felt full. I began having blackout moments where I‚Äôd consume everything in sight and even my friends leftovers when they were full. I was happy but ouch I gained weight :( all the weight I lost back. My cute clothes stopped fitting and I went back to sweatpants and baggie clothes. I tried to go back to anorexia again but I was too Into food to go back. People I haven‚Äôt seen for a year after high school mentioned how thicc I got I FUCKING HATE THAT WORD I felt everyone staring at my tummy
Now I‚Äôm here

My appetite is nil in the AM many days. Some days I am hungry and wanting food, and I will absolutely breakfast those days. Otherwise, I usually have an early lunch and it's typically a big sized meal. And as a mom to teenagers, my kids sometimes eat breakfast and sometimes don't. My daughter usually does eat something for breakfast, my son typically doesn't have an appetite until lunch, with some exceptions. I have always encouraged them to follow their hunger signals. Eat when your hungry. Stop when you are full. But this really is only healthy *outside* of disordered eating, when you will make up the nutrients you need at other eating times and you aren't just skipping them, and you aren't encouraging restriction. That is an important distinction.

When I was early in recovery, I had no ability to truly intuitively eat, so prescribed, structured meals and snacks were a mainstay, and I honestly couldn't have recovered otherwise. And I stayed structured for a few years.  When my RD started introducing intuitive eating, I definitely felt off when I realized some of my personal hunger cues appeared at non-traditional times. But I decided to truly go all in with intuitive eating, and found that I often don't get hunger cues until 11 am or so. Now, some days I want that breakfast, and I have zero issue eating breakfast those days.

So, I think it is ""normalized"" somewhat for a variety of reasons. Some people are not morning people, and food drops off the priority list in early hours. Some people, like kids in school or work commuters, might wake up too late and have to bolt to get to school on time, missing the opportunity for breakfast. That was me in high school. Some people have little appetite in the morning. A finally, others may be trying to control their intake by skipping a meal or following an eating window, which may or may not be a good idea, depending on the individual.

It's literally made to be addictive by hitting all the right taste buds to trigger the receptors in your brain related to feeling good the same way drugs hit them. Fast food companies know this and get away with it because of how people view fat people. 

Worst part of my BED was when every single one of my meals was fast food. Then if my mom cooked I ate that too. 

Basically your taste buds have adapted to the fast food. I went on Keto to drastically change this, and my tastebuds pallet did change. But I developed EDNOS and began chewing &amp; spitting fast food to satiate my cravings for carbs. I dont recommend dieting if you already have an ED. It will just make it worse. 

My suggestion is to start cooking fast food meals at home. You can find near identical recipes online that taste almost the same, and when you prepare your food at home, it's so much easier to control what's eaten. You can start here and help calorie consumption by dabbing paper towels on the meat to soak grease up or by using half portions of sauce. Start really small. The goal is to get your pallet to change because if you were addicted like me, vegetables tasted like SHIT. Anything healthy was bland and boring and didnt spark the joy.

You should also get therapy for this. I'm not sure if you should focus on ED therapy or Addiction therapy, but for now, I'd just focus on getting in to see a therapist. Be OPEN. Be HONEST. A good therapist will understand. 

Sorry if this doesn't help. I'm still addicted to fast food and just made the commitment to stop eating it again and cook at home. I had to stop my dieting and halt weightloss because of how bad my ED got. I was never good with middle ground, always all or nothing.

[],,passercule,,,[],,,,text,t2_8zf6gy68,FALSE,FALSE,[],"First of all, I'm going to repeat what IsAFailure said: your value is not determined by numbers. I know it's hard to believe that when there are numbers everywhere, especially if you're in school and taking exams and constantly being measured in one way or another. Trust me, that's all total bullshit. One of the things you will sadly have to learn about the society you live in is that most of it is actually bullshit. But nobody on their deathbed looks back on their life and wishes they'd been a pound lighter or got an extra point on that test. They all wish they'd done more things they'd enjoyed, and showed the people they loved how much they loved them more often.

Think seriously about whether or not you can talk to your parents about this. I know parents can be unhealthy and even toxic, and impossible to talk to. Mine were like that, so I definitely understand if they're not going to be any use. But if you're a child and living with them, it'll be difficult for you to make changes in your life without their support. If you can get them on your side, that will give you a serious advantage.

If you can get your parents on side, ask if they can help you see a doctor as well. You may well be overweight due to an underlying medical problem, and it is definitely worth checking to see if that is the case, so that you can get treatment if needed. Plus a doctor should be able to advise you on how to eat and exercise healthily in a way that's suited to your age and any conditions you might have. However, be aware that some doctors are just shitty and bad at their jobs. If you do see a doctor, but they don't take you seriously, or they put you down, or the advice they give you seems extreme, try to see another doctor if you can. But the general advice that you can find on the internet, including what everyone says here, is not going to be tailored for your needs. Also, most of it is going to be aimed at adults who are finished their physical development, and may be inappropriate or dangerous for a young teenager. So if you can get a good doctor who can treat and advise you in a way that's appropriate for you, that will also give you a serious advantage.

With all that out of the way, some general advice. When it comes to food, focus on getting nutrition and variety into you. Eat vegetables because they've got vitamins, minerals, and fibre. Your body needs vitamins and minerals to function, and your gut and especially your gut bacteria needs fibre to stay healthy. Try to eat wholegrains instead of processed grains for the same reason, so for example, brown bread instead of white bread. Eat some higher-protein foods with each meal, like meat, fish, dairy products, beans and lentils, tofu. Protein is needed for just about every single process in your body, and your muscles including your heart are made of protein.

And try to make sure you eat lots of different things, so different kinds of vegetables, different sources of protein, etc. Every type of food is slightly different in terms of what it provides, so getting variety in the foods you eat helps you get a better balance of nutrients. For this reason, don't cut foods out of your diet and especially not entire food groups, unless you get proper medical advice first. I know the food pyramid is boring and overused but it really is a pretty reasonable guideline of how to build healthy meals for most people.

Once you've gotten a nutritious and balanced meal into you? Have a treat if you want to. Nice treats are enjoyable, and like I said, nobody gets to the end of their life and wishes they'd enjoyed themselves less. Just make your priority getting the nutrition you need to keep your body working well, and once you've made sure you have what you need to be healthy, then feel free to also have something especially joyful as well if you like.

Exercise is important because again, it helps your body stay healthy. But you can injure yourself if you push too hard, and those injuries can plague you for life, and make it harder for you to exercise properly later. Trust me on this. Find an activity that you enjoy, or that at least fits in well with your schedule, and do it in moderation. Walking is actually remarkably good exercise, so it really doesn't have to be extreme (and like I said, extreme can be dagnerous). Try not to exercise with the goal of losing weight. I know it's hard not to, but like with food, try instead to focus on building yourself up: becoming stronger, having more stamina, being able to do more. That's what fitness really means.",,,1606818597,{},ge8x1px,FALSE,t3_k4bxny,FALSE,TRUE,t3_k4bxny,/r/eating_disorders/comments/k4bxny/help_im_213_lbs_and_only_13_and_56_and_im_so_fat/ge8x1px/,1606818608,1,TRUE,FALSE,eating_disorders,t5_2zzq8,,0,[],
[],,TryNotToBridezilla,,,[],,,,text,t2_62npdcv1,FALSE,FALSE,[],"I think maybe you need to speak to your parents and ask them to help you. Perhaps you could ask if they could only bring treats once or twice per week. Hopefully, they can support you. 

I know I'm the same - if there's treats there, I will eat them and not in moderation either. But, if there aren't any treats, I either won't miss them too much or I'll have to walk to the shop to get some treats, which is definitely better than walking to the fridge. 

Also, finding things to do in your spare time might help too. I don't know what your free time is like at the moment, but I'm finding that working from home I eat dinner earlier, which means I have a much longer evening in which to snack in front of the tv. I have found a few things to keep me occupied so I don't snack so much - I'm teaching myself calligraphy, reorganising most of the house before the Christmas decorations can go up, doing yoga. It makes me feel better in myself and I find that doing healthier things like exercise makes me crave healthier food, whereas junk food makes me want to eat more junk food and do very little.

I know all of this is probably a lot harder when your parents are probably in control of the food shopping, what you have for dinner and what treats they buy, but I think talking to them about making a few healthier switches and buying less treats may help. You could always make more suggestions for healthier meals you would like, I know I always appreciate someone else making a suggestion for dinner.

In a young person, unhealthy mentalities can easily become very entrenched. And in a literal child who still has a lot of physical development ahead of them, extreme eating habits are especially dangerous and especially likely to lead to health problems that can end up plaguing them for life.

[],,BasiliskFangness,,,[],,,,text,t2_11hfer,FALSE,FALSE,[],"Here's a list of things that helped me when I was recovering, so I hope it helps you. 

* If you eat nothing else in a day, eat a banana. Or any other fruit or vegetable you can manage. Of course disordered eating will cause problems for the rest of your body, and reversing that is not going to be immediate. I have found, however, that most people with an ED can manage a fruit or two in a day with no issues. Calories and nutrients help. 
* Stick to washing your hair every 2-3 days instead of daily.
* Make sure your shampoo is sulphate-free. Eating disorders and hormonal changes can make your skin more sensitive and irritated by products that you've otherwise used for years. It also impacts food tolerances! My hairfall was accompanied by a dandruff problem and sudden sensitivity to sulphates which dried the HECK out of my scalp and made my hair fall more. Switch to best sulphate-free and ""natural"" shampoo you can afford.
* I make a hair oil mix to help strengthen my hair before I wash it. This mix contains olive oil, coconut oil, black castor oil, rosemary essential oil, and peppermint essential oil. I massage my scalp with this oil and leave it in for a few hours before washing my hair as usual. 
* Use conditioner as sparingly as possible. If you use oil, scalp massages, and a more natural shampoo, then try skipping conditioner. It adds weight to your hair which can cause weak hair to fall out more easily. If you need the moisture, use conditioner sparingly. I highly recommend using aloe vera gel and a few drops of oil on the ends of your wet hair once you're finished shampooing. Just leave it in and it does a decent job keeping your hair nourished. 
* Biotin won't always work. I've tried. Look for a hair, skin, and nail complex that contains: biotin, B-vitamins (B3, B6, B12 and the works), folic acid (this is important), magnesium and iron. Additionally, vitamin D3 (if you don't get enough sunshine), and collagen. Take these in addition to your multivitamin. 
* Get screened for a hormonal disorder or autoimmune condition that could be causing your hairfall. My disordered eating started at 12, and I was diagnosed with PCOS at 19. I've undergone inumerable hormonal shifts and bodily changes in the past decade which all affected my hair. Your hair will change with your body and your health. It's helpful to get your blood screened extensively on a yearly basis to keep track of what could be causing certain changes.
