I think my sister has a binge eating disorder but any time I try to bring up getting help to her, it always results in more binge eating. I don't know how to talk to her about getting help because I'm always scared it's going to result in a binge. Does anyone have any experience with this and how did you successfully stop this cycle? Also, I've read in guides that when you talk to them about getting help you should try to limit mention of food or their eating habits, but I'm not sure how to site my concerns about her binges otherwise. Does anyone have any advice? Could you give me examples?","Hi everyone,

1,03/06/2021,IsuspectmylittlebrotherhasanED,"Yesterday my dad called me and told me he thinks my brother has been throwing up after meals. He noticed that my brother doesn't drink any liquids when he eats and the promptly chugs liquid after dinner. He also noticed obvious throw-up underneath the toilet. My dad told me that he confronted my brother about it, asking him if he's been throwing up after meals. My brother denied it and said the throw up was from one time when he ate too many snacks and felt sick. I am in my 20s and don't live with my family, but when I was home last I noticed my brother skipping a lot of meals because he slept in so long. I really only saw him eat dinner, but he said he ate snacks at night when he was still awake playing video games and we were all asleep. He's always considered himself ""chubby"" and I remember him struggling as a kid regarding it. I am also realizing that he's been obsessed with always chewing gum for the past few months. Maybe that is his way of trying to cover up his breath after purging? My dad had an eating disorder when he was younger for 14 years. He somehow managed to stop his behaviors entirely by himself and seems to think my brother will do the same. I feel so sad and worried and scared. Yesterday after I found out, I reached out to my brother just to play a game online with him and have a casual conversation. I didn't bring anything up about his eating habits because I want to make sure I'm the best support person I can be. Our parents aren't the best proponents of mental health and positive guidance. I also feel so guilty for being far away and not being able to be with him in person. I will be going home in a week though. He hasn't been diagnosed or anything but I don't think I'm overreacting, but maybe somehow the throwing up was just a one time thing? I don't know what to think - I want to take this seriously and be helpful but I also don't want to overreact and be overbearing. Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated","Yeah, who knows what the situation is.  But the idea that your dad would think to mention it to you…He probably wouldn't do that if he wasn't concerned.  I suppose he could be overly sensitive to the matter, having had an ED himself, but then again because he did have his own struggles he may have an eye for things.  For now, it sounds like it could still be hard to draw conclusions. ","Yeah, who knows what the situation is.

As far as ""symptoms"" go, I'd keep an eye out for various ways that he feels about himself.  People with EDs are often really harshly self-judgmental about themselves, and can question whether they are worthy human beings, so that might be one thing you'd want to look out for.

3,01/08/2021,Isuspectmysisterhasaneatingdisorder.HowinvolvedshouldIget?,"I have an awesome little sister who is going to turn 17 in March. I am concerned that she has developed an eating disorder or is on the path to developing one.
  Recently, my family and I have noticed that she is not on a regular eating ""schedule."" She will skip meals, sleep through them, or just have a snack. None of her food choices are very healthy, even though my mom makes healthy dinner options for her. She instead opts fast food. At first, I just assumed her altered eating was a result of a ""quarantine"" blues type of thing, but her habits aren't changing.
  My eyes weren't truly open to the situation until today. I was with my sister and her boyfriend on a shopping trip. I told her that she was looking really skinny (which I realize now is not the way I should have brought up my concern) and I again expressed my worries about her skipping meals. She admitted to me for the first time that she has a fear of gaining weight. She assured me that she doesn't ""starve"" herself and she eats when she is hungry. I started reminding her how she needs to eat healthier in order for her body to function. She responded that she ""doesn't want to get fat,"" and so I reminded her that if she was concerned about that part, she could always stay active and exercise. She told me that she didn't have time to exercise. At that point in the conversation, I then asked her if she had an eating disorder. She didn't say yes, but she didn't say no. I don't think she is certain either way herself.
  I told her that she needs to talk to our mom about all of this. She said she ""might,"" but told me not to discuss it with my mom.
  My question is: how much or little involved should I be? And what does the involvement look like? Do I let my mom know of the conversation that I had with my sister today, even though my sister told me not to mention it? Or should I stay out of it, knowing that my sister may never independently seek help? Either way, I am going to research how to be supportive in situations like this. Right now, she's in a world of high school self-consciousness, fake social media body ""influencers,"" and a relationship in which her boyfriend is incredibly body-image conscious.
  This is my first experience with someone close to me having a challenge like this (that I know of), so any advice is appreciated. I know how serious this issue is, and I would hate to see my sister hurt. I'm just unsure if it's my place to discuss it with our mother or not.
  Thank you.
P.S.: Now that I look back on our conversation today, I realize that I may have addressed my concerns the wrong way. I will be educating myself on ways to be supportive so that I will be better prepared for future situations.","Dear Froggie8, it's great that you would like to support your sister during this difficult time!

Unfortunately, commentary on weight has been in our culture’s crosshairs for a long time. If she isn’t getting a message about weight personally from someone, it will come through media and other sources. So... it’s impossible to protect her from it. She may need to be the one to shut down the comments with you at her side.

My mom never saw anything wrong in this, even as my sister lost an incredible amount of weight and became a skeleton. I finally convinced her to get my sister some help so she took her to a nutritionist and our GP, but never a mental health professional. She's gained a little weight, enough to satisfy my mom, but she still looks very unhealthy and scary to me. ","My sister has struggled with an eating disorder for about 5 years.

I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this as a family. When I was going through my eating disorder as a teen, my family had a similar dynamic in terms of brushing it under the rug, which ultimately made things worse of course.  I think appealing to her mom could be a good approach, and perhaps appealing in the most non-accusatory way that you can while trying to inspire action?  The turning point for me getting treatment was actually a neighbor who approached my parents and voiced her concerns and went to them with more of a ""I know this is scary, and this isn't your fault, but we have to do something or your daughter is going to die.""  Every family is different, and every situation is different.  I'm sharing what triggered action in my situation in the hopes that it might be a viable avenue for you.  Good luck, and great job seeking support!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,08/30/2020,Whattodo?,I didn’t see a forum for family members that weren’t siblings so I apologize but this is my cousin. She has been doing this for years while she was a minor and now that she just turned 18. Her mother refuses to admit that she has anorexia even though doctors and psychologists diagnosed her. Her father is too weak to stand up to his wife. Her mother got her out of the hospital twice within days because she refused to say her daughter has a problem. My cousin is no longer going to doctors appointments now that she is an adult. What can I do? She has never looked thinner. Her heart rate is in the low 30s. She is dying and I don’t know what I can do me and her brother have tried to talk to her and she completely shuts us out. Any help works I just need to do something.,"Hi monkcarter, thank you for posting.

9,08/04/2020,Howcanihelpmylittlesister,"My little sister is 15 and in this past year has developed anorexia. She lost a lot of weight and is now really underweight and had to get bloodwork done at the hospital. They discovered physical symptoms during that doctor visit I never even knew of, she had kept secret. I realized that even I had not realized how serious her ED had become. My mom is now searching for a therapist, although the only open appointments were a month away. She’s still looking for more immediate help for my sister but i fear that because she isn’t in an inpatient nor outpatient program she isn’t getting the help she needs so desperately. I cry everyday because i hate myself for not speaking up when i initially noticed her exercising daily and eating less. She is now severely underweight, and she constantly is frowning even while my family is laughing with eachother and i look over and i notice it. It makes me sad that she is so unhappy all the time, i know the ED is taking its toll on her mental health. She also stays home a lot, she’s the only one in my family who doesn’t work, so it’s difficult to cheer her up unless my mom is home to take her out- even then she seems down and has a temper. I want to know anything i can do to help. We had a really heartfelt conversation the day she went to the doctor, and i continue to make lunches for her and dinners that she will eat. Yet she isn’t eating much more than before, still small portions- even if now she’s eating 2 meals rather than 1 barely eaten meal a day. Im just worried we aren’t getting her help quickly enough. I’m constantly stressing that i’m not helping enough because i don’t know how to approach the topic. I ask if she is okay, if she is hungry, i hangout with her and watch tv with her when im home.. I just fear that she is so depressed and crippled by this. She tells my mom she struggles so much with eating & does not wanna gain weight. Since she kept it a secret so long i think its so much more comfortable for her to just keep her thoughts to her self, she tells my mom the most out of any of us but. I wanna be there for her too as best i can. Are we doing anything that is hurting her? Is there anything I should take into account? I would so much appreciate the advice of someone who has recovered from such a brutal disorder..

EDs tend to sneak up on people, and while we can look back and think about all of the things that we wished we had done, and berate ourselves for not being aware of things which seem obvious now, the fact is that most people aren't very familiar with EDs, and it's kind of the normal thing for it to take a while for them to figure things out.

Being cranky and irritable all the time is a pretty common symptom when people suspect that others are ""against them"" and are going to be wanting them to give up their ED.  I mean don't people understand all of the effort and extreme self-discipline it's taken them to get to this point ?  And they expect her to welcome the idea of throwing that all away, and  just ""getting fat"" again ?   You can understand why she might be feeling pissy.

Go on a hike, go to the museum (if you can)- anything to keep her in touch with the world. That may not seem like much, but sometimes things like that can give the person a break from the never-ending ED chatter that's going on in their heads.Plus people with EDs are often frustrated.

If I were you, I  would ask her to get a wellness check up, ""just to be safe"", but you would want to make sure that she is honest with the doctor about her limited food intake, even if she thinks ""it's fine/no big deal"". This is because, even if as of right now, her blood work or other lab results are not critical, the doctor will still express concern and be able to warn her about the dangers she is bringing upon herself, and recommend a safer level of food intake. Would there be anyone who could attend this appointment with her, to make sure she does mention the disordered eating to the physician?

Which is an idea which might sound more appealing to her ?Anyhow, just some thoughts.  Things like this are difficult, and sometimes you gotta come at them from the side to begin with, rather than starting by confronting them head on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,04/29/2020,HowcanIbesthelpher,"Hi - I am new the forum and I am very thankful for it! Recently, I have been home living with my sister because of all the recent quarantine orders. I have been very aware of my sisters ED. She Is diagnosed with disordered eating and does not yet fit the criteria for a specific ED. Living with her and seeing her habits form / fluctuate have been so hard for me. I just keep watching her control so much of her food and go so many days eating so little. My fear, of course, is the disease growing and becoming more and more severe. My sister is aware of her struggles and actually acknowledges how difficult it’s been for her.
I guess I am struggling with how to live with her that is supportive but also learning to cope there is not much I can do... she is older, 20, and typically at school living away from home. I also am typically not home with her but given the circumstances. I also am a fixer and it is such my instinct to be proactive and try and assist and fix the problem which we all know doesn’t work unless the person wants to get better. Any advice on how to process, and mostly learn how to not worry so much about our siblings. Also maybe just more information on what’s appropriate to support them but not push them or become fixated on things.  Thank you in advanced. I know there is so much more to this story that is too much to share.  i appreciate everyone here.",We understand your concern and want you to know that we have some resources to assist you. You can always call our NEDA Helpline at 800.931.2237 M-TH 11am-9pm ET and F 11am-5pm ET. You can also visit our page geared toward helping you help a loved one https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/help/caregivers which has tips on how to talk to your sister and encourage her to seek professional help.,"hey,
We're in pretty much the same boat. My sister is also 20, and we don't usually live together but quarantine has brought us both back from college to our parents house. I don't know if my parents are really aware that she struggles with this; she's had mental health issues in the past but she's never seen someone for eating disorder related things specifically as far as I know. I think I might only know about it because I pay attention (and sometimes she hints at it on social media). But the last couple weeks I've noticed it's getting worse. She doesn't eat all day until a she eats a smallish dinner (we eat dinner as a family, and I think she's trying to keep us from noticing). She also has taken up running, which scares me cause I know she's exercising on an empty stomach and that can be dangerous.
I don't know what to do! I'm kind of afraid to bring it up with her, I don't really know why. Maybe I'm afraid that she'll just hide from me more and will stop trusting me. I also don't want to tell my parents because I don't think they will deal with it well. I feel so stuck and scared and helpless. I'm also the kind of person who needs to fix things, and she's my younger sister so I will always feel very protective of her. I guess my first step is probably to talk to her about it but I'm afraid and overwhelmed. Ugh","hi guys. i am in the same boat as your sisters-- home from school with eating disorder struggles while trying to make sure no one notices or gets too concerned. i grew up watching my sister suffer from life threatening depression, and there is no worse feeling of hopelessness as you watch someone's mental health crumble. as far as EDs go, the best thing that you can do is just check in. not ""i noticed you aren't eating"" or ""please eat"" or anything drastic, just ask if something is up and if there is anything you can do. this is hard to hear but there is probably nothing you can say to get rid of disordered thoughts and behaviors, but encouraging to get help and even offer to keep the conversation confidential from parents. I am so nervous about concerning my parents, and if they aren't jumping at the idea to talk to a therapist the last thing you should do is bring parents into the conversation right at the jump. encourage professional help, ask what you can do, find out what is helpful by asking and know that you cannot fix them, but you can help them find a way to seek recovery :)","also-- expressing concern is nice but one of the worst ED thoughts i experience is wanting to keep things from everyone because you don't want to make the whole family's life worse with an ED. if my sister came to me and said ""i am worried about you and i am scared"" i would feel terrible for my actions affecting her emotions. definitely doesn't apply to everyone but just something to consider",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,04/16/2020,Canpeopletrulyunderstand?,I feel I've reached a breaking point in talking to friends about my sister's ED.

Does anyone else feel this frustration?,"I feel I've reached a breaking point in talking to friends about my sister's ED. But I also feel torn about my frustration with this - is it really fair to blame them for not understanding what I'm going through? Does anyone else feel this frustration?My sister is on her 5th hospital admission now and has been struggling for the last 10 years with this illness. Early on I was met with all of the classic unhelpful remarks, which I would try to take lightly. But I feel like those around me are now just tired of this situation and don't want to talk to me about it anymore. I'm constantly met with ""she's back in hospital again?"" and ""Is this still going on?"" (sadly those quotes are not exaggerations). It's not only just a lack of understanding of the illness but I think people find it hard, in general, to talk about illnesses that seemingly have no end or cure in sight. There is no silver lining they can try and comfort you with so instead they'd rather not talk about it at all. ","I feel I've reached a breaking point in talking to friends about my sister's ED.

There is no silver lining they can try and comfort you with so instead they'd rather not talk about it at all. But I've got to the point where this frustration is causing me to end relationships and friendships as I find it so difficult to be around people that make these comments and have these misunderstandings. I know I should try and be more forgiving to them but in all honestly, I've run out of energy to do that. Part of me just thinks I should stop talking about this with friends all together and I am really lucky to have a great family support system who are so helpful. But not talking about it at all with people I am close to just seems impossible. This is part of my life, a very big part of my life and I just don't think I can just pretend it's not there and everything is fine. How can I move forwards with this?","It's hard when friends let you down. I came to a situation in which my friends let me down some time ago & decided to write them a letter, telling them the problems & that I was struggling to continue the friendship. If your friends' disinterest continues, maybe they aren't the best friends for you & it might be best to move on. It's a sad reality to face but there are plenty of people who are willing to listen to your problems regarding your sister & sympathise with them. Those people would be great friends for you. This forum is proof that there are caring people in the world. I wish you & your family well & hope you find some new good friends soon!","Thank you so much for your comment. It sounds strange, but in a way, it's comforting to know that others have had the same problems with their friends too. Having said that, I'm really sorry about your friends and I hope the letter helped the situation with them. I think it could be a good thing to try as I find talking to people quite intimidating sometimes. Thank you again for your kind and supportive words.","Ugh, it sucks to be alone with situations like this, but at the same time, if other people have not been through things like this themselves, it's a lot to expect them to understand it.","Ugh, it sucks to be alone with situations like this, but at the same time, if other people have not been through things like this themselves, it's a lot to expect them to understand it.Of course they want to ""say something"" but as you've seen, coming up with words that are helpful or understanding can be difficult for a lot of  people.

It is a lot to expect of people to understand such a complex disorder - but also to understand the complex ways families and friends of people with ED suffer too... I do feel my own mood and thoughts about it all change a lot too, sometimes I'm really angry, other times I feel very low and other times I can't really express how I feel. I can see that that can be a lot for someone with no experience of mental health to deal with.
I think you're right about trying to find peace with it too, and I think it is important to see the difference in intention when people are not wanting to engage vs trying to engage but not really understanding.
Thank you for your support! I appreciate it very much","Hi there. First, welcome. I am sorry that you have been dealing with friends who just don't understand and your sister dealing with an eating disorder. I am sure it isn't easy on you either. I know my sister's had trouble dealing with me and my struggles. It does seem that mental health issues are frowned upon more than medical but that is because they are so misunderstood. And often it takes a long time to heal from. They are so multifaceted. I encourage you to take care of yourself while you support your sister. Do you two talk?

Yes, me and my sister are very close and we talk all the time which I am really grateful for.... but I do think that can make it hard for people to understand too... obviously this illness can make her a difficult person to deal with sometimes and if I talk to my friends about that side of it they will say things like ""she's a nightmare"" and ""why do you do all this for her, she's not a good person"". That really hurts because even though the things she has done and put my family thought have been pretty bad but she is still my sister and I still love her very much. I think that complex relationship is really difficult for people who don't have experience of mental health to understand and can lead to those hurtful remarks.
I will always put my family over any other relationship and I think sometimes when I feel like I can't be friends with people anymore it's as much to protect my sister as it is to protect myself in a strange way... I just don't want people who say things like that to be anywhere near her.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So it's just a tough thing all around, and part of our task is to try and tease out the positive bits, and see them as such.  And then see what we can do from there.You wrote :""A few days later we went shopping and she opened up to me about it, and told me things that I hadn't been aware of before. She told me that at a time she had been restricting, and that she'd fainted several times when no one was home during that period. She started eating more after she had fainted a few times, but even up until now shes still counting calories and wants to work down to a lower number. ""So there's one of the positive things.  For whatever reason she chose to tell you about some matters that concerned her.  It's a big step when people can begin to recognize those things, and an even bigger step to admit them to someone.  So really, there's one important step that she's taken.  Even if it ends up with the ""I'm fine"" thing."" I'm lost on what to do. I can't be forceful about it because that never works. I cant make it clear to her that I'm worried about her because then she'll just hide it better. ""Well yes, she may try and hide it.  But the thing is…you already know.  So that's how I'd approach it if I were you : You already know the truth of the matter, and probably should resist acting as though there's something she can successfully say to dissuade you from thinking that it's not happening.  Because you do know.  And that's because she took the risk to tell you herself.  Which was brave of her, you know ?And it was brave, so I think it's OK for you to acknowledge that fact when the two of you talk.Because if she's going to get better, she's going to need to continue to be brave.  And I think that that's something you can legitimately continue to encourage.Anyhow, just some thoughts.  I hope you'll continue to keep writing, if it seems to help a bit ?Bob J.","Dear Mothman, you mentioned that your sisted fainted a few times.

16,03/03/2020,SisterDenial(reflux),"hi my sister has had an eating disorder for nearly 2 years and at the beginning was eating normally but obviously purging afterwards. she is now at the stage where she claims she no longer has an eating disorder but that she has an eating reflux, where anything she eats automatically comes back up. she denies this is an eating disorder problem and is adament its a physical condition. my parents and me are out of answers and she is not starting to refuse to go and see her therapists as she claims she is over her eating disorder and just wants her stomach relux to be fixed and she will be all better. i dont know whether to face up to her and say this still is her eating disorder or go along with her and hope she continues to talk to her therapists and she will get better? any help at all would be so appreciated. thanks","I'm not an expert on this, but people can have medical problems (specifically gastroparesis) where they eat, but their stomach won't empty itself along into the rest of their digestive system, so the food just sits there and they end up throwing everything back up again.

17,04/08/2019,Mysisterisevil,"I am really struggling to come to terms with my sister ruining my family. She has been ill for approx 12 years now, and I am at breaking point. I was still growing up when her issues began, and as she is my older sister, I assumed all older sisters were nasty, hysterical, violent, manipulative, and generally unstable. As I got older, this became quite obviously untrue. My sister struggles with lots of mental health issues, but the ones which manifest themselves most obviously are the anorexia and bulimia b/p. To preface this, I am well aware, all too aware, of the affects of eating disorders on the brain. I know she is not in control/her brain is starved, she does not choose to be unwell. Unfortunately, when it comes to my sister, it is not that simple. The fact of the matter is that before she even got ill, she was quite horrible. Now she is unwell, everyone says, 'oh, its not her fault, she's sick! poor her'. For starters, she was nasty before, so it's not all the illness. Second of all, poor her?! Poor my mum, poor my dad, poor me? My mother cries herself to sleep every night, my sister is very abusive to her and constantly tries to blame her and inflict pain on her. She is a nasty, nasty girl, and I don't know what to do. When people hear she is mentally ill, they immediately gravitate toward sympathy. I don't understand where the sympathy or understanding for family members who are under the complete control of the ill person is? She rules my family like a despotic leader, my parents are so scared of her harming herself that they will do whatever she wants. She steals, she lies, she abuses, and no one says anything. I don't know her at all. Before I was 10, she was horrible, and from the age of 10-21, she was horrible and mentally ill. It's incredibly hard to feel supportive, and in fact I no longer feel supportive at all. For a while, I tried to help her - for years, in fact, to have it thrown back in my face. She refuses to live with my parents despite the fact that they pay for everything as she dropped out of school, uni, and refuses to get a job. So now she is living with me - she leaves mouldy food everywhere, breaks appliances by purging into them, blocks my plumbing, makes me gets rats, and I have no choice because where else would she go? On top of it all, she is horrible. My parents don't want to get her committed as they fear she would hate them forever, yet her weight is lower than ever and she is very obviously deeply unwell. I am sick and tired of her and I am sick and tired of her abusing and manipulating my family. I feel horrible writing that I have given up on a family member, but I can't take it anymore. I just want to know that some other people have also reached the end of their tether. Please don't lecture me/say I am being mean. I don't have capacity for that.","Hello.  I am so, so sorry for you pain.   I get the feeling that you were probably also neglected as your parents have put all their attention onto your sister who doesn't seem to want their help, just their handouts.  You are not selfish nor are you being mean.  You are suffering and are in a lot of pain.  You are probably worried, angry, worried about your parents, feeling badly that you have been overlooked, correct me if I am wrong.  When a member of the family is so sick, often parent's are unable to let go and say no more.  Not no more love, but until the individual, your sister, is wanting to get help, to change, than something has to change.  I would like to explain my situation because I feel it is similar.  My sister pretty much lives in her room in bed.  I don't know when she eats or even goes to the bathroom.  She has ligit medical problems, but she isn't getting the help she needs.  She had been living at her house for twenty years rarely leaving her couch.  Then she moved in with me about two years ago.  She rarely leaves her room and now claims intractable pain, isn't eating, sleeping, so she says, and I am angry.  She never asks how I am doing.  She is very self absorbed and I am upset that my parent's allow her to do this.  for the better part of two years my sister has been a control freak, never contributing to household expenses, never cleans, everything is done for her.  Just recently she has been mandated to contribute to household expenses by our father who is our landlord.  There were such fights even though she hardly came out of her room.  I was ready to leave, but I can not afford to.  She doesn't listen to anyone even doctors.  My Mom is conflicted because of her medical issues.  I think they are doing too  much for her.  I know they are worried about her physical health but what they can not grasp is that they are hurting her more than they are helping her.  And I am angry.  I am told not to be, that I have a choice to be angry or not, but I am also afraid that she is going to die.
Back to you sister.  To have someone who is mean, cruel perhaps, running the two households and holding everyone hostage is not fair.  Does she have to live with you?  Can you find your own place?  It may not bode well with your parents but that is not your responsibility.   Right now you need to take care of you before you get sick.  People can take advantage of their mental illness and use it as an excuse, my idea.   If someone isn't willing or able to get the help they need someone needs to be called in and an assessment needs to take place to see if she is safe to be living by herself.  You can not take care of her.  You have your own life.  It is not fair for your parent's to expect you to, especially if she is abusing you.  That is not to be tolerated.  Mentally ill or not.

I know they are worried about her physical health but what they can not grasp is that they are hurting her more than they are helping her.  And I am angry.  I am told not to be, that I have a choice to be angry or not, but I am also afraid that she is going to die.
Back to you sister.  To have someone who is mean, cruel perhaps, running the two households and holding everyone hostage is not fair.  Does she have to live with you?  Can you find your own place?  It may not bode well with your parents but that is not your responsibility.   Right now you need to take care of you before you get sick.  People can take advantage of their mental illness and use it as an excuse, my idea.   If someone isn't willing or able to get the help they need someone needs to be called in and an assessment needs to take place to see if she is safe to be living by herself.  You can not take care of her.  You have your own life.  It is not fair for your parent's to expect you to, especially if she is abusing you.  That is not to be tolerated.  Mentally ill or not.  I am really sorry for all the fear you have lived with all these years, the years that were stolen from you due to your sisters illness.  Your own losses and confusion.  What do your other siblings have to say about all of this? Can you talk to a therapist and ask them what they think you should do?  Get help for yourself to talk about your pain and suffering?  You can't keep doing this forever.  She needs help and you can not help her as her needs are too great.","Hello.  I am so, so sorry for you pain.   I get the feeling that you were probably also neglected as your parents have put all their attention onto your sister who doesn't seem to want their help, just their handouts.  You are not selfish nor are you being mean.  You are suffering and are in a lot of pain.  You are probably worried, angry, worried about your parents, feeling badly that you have been overlooked, correct me if I am wrong.  When a member of the family is so sick, often parent's are unable to let go and say no more.  Not no more love, but until the individual, your sister, is wanting to get help, to change, than something has to change.  I would like to explain my situation because I feel it is similar.  My sister pretty much lives in her room in bed.  I don't know when she eats or even goes to the bathroom.  She has ligit medical problems, but she isn't getting the help she needs.  She had been living at her house for twenty years rarely leaving her couch.  Then she moved in with me about two years ago.  She rarely leaves her room and now claims intractable pain, isn't eating, sleeping, so she says, and I am angry.  She never asks how I am doing.  She is very self absorbed and I am upset that my parent's allow her to do this.  for the better part of two years my sister has been a control freak, never contributing to household expenses, never cleans, everything is done for her.

As a fellow younger sister of an eating disorder sufferer I can absolutely relate. In fact your story sounds very similar to mine, at least at the beginning. Fortunately at the age of 21 and after 10 years of suffering, my sister moved away from our family and started her own healing journey. It came about after my parents threw up their hands and said she could no longer stay. It was the hardest thing for my parents to do, and it broke my heart to give up on my older sister. We didn't know if she would live or die, but we knew she couldn't stay and continue to destroy our family and herself.
She went through a hard road, but she is now much healthier than before. I'm not sure you can say she is free from mental illness, but her physical health is good and that has helped substantially with her mental health.
I commend you Sue for doing so much for your sister, for not giving up. You are a kind and loving person. From my experience though, the care you provide her may be allowing her to continue to manipulate you and your family and hence prolong her (and your suffering). She's not evil, this illness is evil and it's taken her over. It hurts me to say it, but you need to let her go. You need to show the illness that you will no longer let it control your life, and this will also show your sister that it doesn't have to control hers. Please have hope, and tell her to have hope, cuz it is curable, but it will take space and time and discipline on your part to commit to letting her begin to heal on her own (and with the help of prodessionals if she chooses).
My heart goes out to you girl, and to your sister. Good luck, let me know if you wanna chat more. ","Hi Sue, I've just joined the site therefore just read your post.

18,01/13/2020,MyBrother,"A couple of months ago I was reading and posting on the forum when I came across a post that went something like this, ""I have a lot of anxiety surrounding what my sister eats. I have bad eating habits and sometimes so does she. I always compare what I eat to what she eats. I just have to eat less than her, and it makes me so sad when she doesn't eat a lot, I have a problem with eating and she knows this, but I just have to eat less than her.""
I didn't think much of it until I saw the username, it was my brothers name. And what was posted seemed like he definitely wrote it. I think a lot about that now. I am posting on the forums because of my ED problems, and so is he. Yet, neither of us knew that the other was so troubled by our ED's. We both hide it from each other.","Wow, that is incredible.  Does he know you know?  Do you think you can talk about it?  How do you feel about this?  Are you okay?  This can really be a time of healing for the both of you.  If you are able, please let us know more about what happens from here.  Thank you for sharing.","Wow, that is incredible.  Does he know you know?  Do you think you can talk about it?

19,12/21/2019,Beingabigsisterinrecovery,"So I’m in recovery from anorexia. I have two little sisters who don’t live with me, but whom I’m very close to. This summer we spent a lot of time together when my ED was in full swing. They saw it progressively get worse and worse and they also saw the beginning days of my recovery. Even in my ED, I tried to talk positively about food, but I know actions speak louder than words. I feel really bad because I never want them to do this to themselves.
They are also going through some tough stuff. One of them eats like a normal kid but has major self esteem issues (I see so much of myself in her it’s scary) and the other way really healthy and is constantly praised for it. Neither of them have given me cause to think they have a food problem.
I know because of recovery I’m super vigilant about food, diet culture, eating, body talk, etc.
I guess my point is: for you guys who are siblings of people with EDs, what are some things that would have helped you? What can I be doing to be a better older sister and example? I can’t turn off my discomfort and attitude towards food and every day is a battle but I love them and I want that love to be stronger than my eating disorder.","Hi.  I am sorry you are dealing with an eating disorder.  I think it is so caring that you are reaching out for help to know how to help your younger siblings.  When I was young I never thought about how my illness would affect my sisters but it did.  I almost dies in front of my then thirteen year old sister, I was sixteen.  Since then my sisters have stayed their distance from me as I have been dealing with disordered eating for so long.  They blamed me for being sick and don't understand that a lot of the way they have coped with life has in some ways been just as unhealthy but since I was in the hospital so many times I am blamed for not getting over it.","Hi.

20,12/13/2019,Sisterdoing12steps-forgiveness,"Hi
My sister has had an eating disorder for years. she came out of a clinic two weeks ago. it was a clinic that treated eating disorders like an addiction, so started her along the 12 steps path used by AA and others. Today I think she must have got to a step about forgiveness as i got a message from her saying ' Today i decided to forgive you. not because you apologised or because you acknowledged the pain that you cased me, but because my soul deserves peace'.
I wasn't aware that she was feeling angry with me about anything. what do you recommend i do? it was a picture message from a calm app so I don't know what to do with it. It makes me angry tbh but I'm sure that's not a helpful response!
has anyone else's siblings gone through this?","Oh brother, I can see where this might be confusing !  But things like this happen sometimes, when people find themselves considering various emotional themes.   I'm not very familiar with 12 Step, but one of it's steps may involve the theme of forgiveness ?  And if that's the case, then maybe you might find yourself needing someone or something to forgive ?   Even if you hadn't really thought much about that before ?","Oh brother, I can see where this might be confusing !

Even if you hadn't really thought much about that before ?Having said that, yes, it's not too emotionally considerate to forgive someone, without informing them what it is that you are forgiving them for.  That sounds kind of passive-egressive to me. So in turn, you may need to forgive her for that ?  Not that I would tell her that, but maybe you know what I mean.  The whole thing must be kind of confusing I know.","Oh brother, I can see where this might be confusing !

And if that's the case, then maybe you might find yourself needing someone or something to forgive ?   Even if you hadn't really thought much about that before ?Having said that, yes, it's not too emotionally considerate to forgive someone, without informing them what it is that you are forgiving them for.  That sounds kind of passive-egressive to me. So in turn, you may need to forgive her for that ?  Not that I would tell her that, but maybe you know what I mean.  The whole thing must be kind of confusing I know.If it were me, I would not get into it with her.  This forgiveness thing is for her, and for a process of her own that she is going through, and there's probably something good to be said for that.So if you feel that you need to provide a response, you might simply say that you are glad that she is finally finding resolution for old issues that she may had in the past ?Which would be a truthful response, I suspect ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  I was reading the post about your sister and was wondering how things are going now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,10/04/2019,Howtochoosepathoftreatmentformysister,I've done some research on eating disorder treatment (anorexia is my sister's issue) but how do you decide which kind of treatment? My sister works full time and has kids. There are centers that seem unrealistic due to the expectation that someone will spend many hours there per week. I also looked at psychiatrists which seem more realistic (1 hour per week or however many sessions you want to pay for). How to make a decision where to start? Each option is a little different. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks,"Hi! Thank you for posting. We’re sorry to hear about what’s been going with your sister! We hope that you are able to get the support you deserve.

I am so sorry your sister is going through this terrible struggle, at the same time I am proud of you and want to say thank you to you on behalf of sisters who care enough to want to try to help their sibling.  As said, unfortunately we are unable to mention specific programs, but I would like you to consider something.    She is dealing with a life threatening illness.  Going into a partial hospital program my take her away from her job, for which she should have protection, and spend long days in therapy.  But if you look at the long picture, if it helps and she gets stronger, she will be able to be a better parent, and employee.  Eating disorders take so much from someone.  It is much like someone who is addicted to drugs.  Their only thought is how to get the next drug.  The brain is unable to function properly if not nourished.  Sound decisions, thinking clearly, just can not happen because the brain is malnourished along with the rest of her body.  So if she gets help now then she stands a better chance at weekly or bi-weekly therapy.  Unfortunately, it can be expensive to seek treatment, and it shouldn't be this way.  I am fortunate that I have Medicare and Medicaid and I can get therapy, but not with a trained eating disorder therapist.  But that is okay because I am in recovery and am back in therapy to help deal with an abusive family member and a family member who is young and may be going onto hospice soon.  But a therapist can help deal with underlying issues, fears, traumas, even if they don't specialize in eating disorders.  ","Hello.

I ressent my mum for being so immature and unable to cope with my sister's illness. I myself am tired and I can't see an end to this. I plan every day around my sisters meals and her progress and I visit my other sister at least once a week.

I feel a lot of guilt because I'm the oldest sister, and my two sisters idolise me and have ever since they were little. We've always been very close. I left home for the first time last year to work in France, the job was part of my university degree, and I was away when the first twin was admitted to hospital. My parents told me not to return home and I was scared about not honouring my job contract/not getting college credit. My parents said that coming home wouldn't change anything and I was only 6 weeks away from the end of my contract. When those 6 weeks were up and I did come home, I found the second twin emaciated and my parents in complete denial about it. They'd been focusing so much on the first twin who was diagnosed and in hospital, that the second twin was left to her own devices. I spoke with them the second I was home from the airport, and only then did they get her referred and eventually diagnosed and on a treatment plan.

She's gaining weight even if she doesn't want to, sometimes it feels like theres two sides to her - the one who wants to go back to school and be her old self, and the one who's terrified of food and hates the whole family.

I'm very proud of her! I think my other sister would recover quicker if she was inpatient, but that would be painful in its own way, and I want her to stay home. She's gaining weight even if she doesn't want to, sometimes it feels like theres two sides to her - the one who wants to go back to school and be her old self, and the one who's terrified of food and hates the whole family. thanks again for the kind words, I think this forum is going to be really helpful in the coming months","""sometimes it feels like there's two side to her-the one who wants  to go back to school and be her old self, and the one who's terrified of food and hates the whole family"".  Very well stated and so very true.  The fear drives a person with an eating disorder, anorexia, to be people they never were, to say hateful things, lie, and self destruct because of the fear of gaining weight.  I used to find safety in being underweight and there are issues that cause one to turn to an eating disorder and initially it is used as a coping mechanism but then the disorder takes over and the individual no longer is in control but the disorder is.  There is a lot hiding behind the fear of gaining or food.  That is why therapy is so important.  Could you write a letter about how you are really feeling and read it at the next family session?  It is really important for you to  have a voice too.  And it may help reduce your own anxiety and depression as well.  I am glad to hear your other sister's outing went so well.   Yay!!!!  Eating disorders are so complex.  They are very difficult to treat and recover from.  But...recovery is possible.  I recommend you reading through some of the other posts on the other headings so you can see the challenges.  I am trying to help some talk more about what is underneath their fears and symptoms, to talk about their fears as this will help the recovery process.  I was afraid to get better because I was afraid to live in the real world.  Hiding out in hospitals as horrible as that was was easier than living outside of them.  Then God healed me.  I am free from all behaviors and addictions and am getting ready to start volunteering to help those who suffer with eating disorders.  My user name, iwanttolive is so true because for most of my life I wanted to die.  My life Scripture is I will not die but live and declare the works of the Lord.

I just wanted to say thank you so much for posting this. My younger sister has been struggling with anorexia for over a year and I have gotten to the point where I can't live my life like this anymore. It is so debilitating to see your family practically fall apart due to an ED. I miss the way our family used to be and especially how my sister and I used to have so much fun together. I feel so sad, angry, and lonely as a result of her mental illness. I can no longer keep my feelings in so I am going to try to find a therapist.

I’ve known about it for almost every day and I feel horrible. I don’t know what to do to help my sister.

I’m so worried about her health and I wish that I knew what to do to help her stop. I’ve tried talking to her but she just waves it off and says that she’s fine. My mother and I are trying to get my sister to agree to go to the hospital and talk to a therapist but she flat out refuses saying that it’s all useless. She already has cuts inside her throat, all that purging and laxatives have messed up her insides so bad that sometimes she has trouble breathing.

My sister does suffer from clinical depression, and she has an anxiety disorder. I do think that her anxiety disorder played a part in her developing an ED. My mom and I have tried multiple times to get her to agree to go see a therapist for her depression but she always refuses. The worst thing is is that she knows what her ED is doing to her health, she’s fully aware of it she just can’t stop. I just don’t know what to do at this point. Like you wrote, I won’t be able to convince her myself to have her stop but she’s become so emotionally dependent on her ED. She’s not trying to overcome it herself, and there’s nothing that I can do that’ll make her realize that she needs to stop. Honestly at this point I’d be more than willing to just force her to go to the hospital or therapy than have this continue for any longer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,04/17/2019,Needingsomeinsight,"My sister has an eating disorder going on three years. The thing is, she isn't sooo bad. That's not me in denial. She's definitely too thin, she needs to gain some weight. But she doesn't starve herself completely, nor does she throw up - she eats, and she's been doing so much better the past 6 weeks. She's been eating three meals a day (I think), and isn't as concerned with what she's been eating. But now, she has the chance to be admitted as an in or out patient (not sure which at this moment) at a facility, and I can tell she's unwilling to go through with it. She wants to enjoy her summer. I want that for her too. But I want her to get better, first and foremost. But I'm not even sure if this is the kind of treatment she needs. The menu they provide seems to be less than what she's eating now. She's gained some weight in the last 4 months. Progress is progress, but I can see how hard it is for her to gain weight, on a physical level. How long does it usually take for someone with an ED to fulfill proper weight restoration? I imagine its different for everyone. Do you think she should go in for treatment? Because maybe if she remains diligent, she can recover on her own, with the support of myself and my parents.","My sister has an eating disorder going on three years.

I want that for her too. But I want her to get better, first and foremost. But I'm not even sure if this is the kind of treatment she needs. The menu they provide seems to be less than what she's eating now. She's gained some weight in the last 4 months. Progress is progress, but I can see how hard it is for her to gain weight, on a physical level. How long does it usually take for someone with an ED to fulfill proper weight restoration? I imagine its different for everyone. Do you think she should go in for treatment? Because maybe if she remains diligent, she can recover on her own, with the support of myself and my parents.I also think going to a therapist is extremely important for her, so she can confront the body image and dysmorphia she's been struggling with for a long, long time. However, she's seen two, both of which seem to not really help. I think its about finding the right person. Would you recommend she talks to someone who has recovered? Like a sponsor of sorts? Where could she find help like that? She's been to a group session, but they have restrictions on what they can talk about as to not trigger anything. I get it, but I think she needs someone she can really be open and honest with, and someone removed from her friend group and family.","My sister has an eating disorder going on three years. The thing is, she isn't sooo bad. That's not me in denial. She's definitely too thin, she needs to gain some weight.

I don't know how to be there for her when she complains about the way she looks. I try not to engage with that kind of conversation, but I just never know what to say or what the right thing to say is. Often, she gets mad and upset no matter what I do. She says that I insinuate that she looks ""different"" aka fat, if I refuse to engage about how she looks, or if I tell her to remember that she doesn't see herself accurately. I try not to take it personally, but I've been having bad anxiety and panic attacks afterwards. I've been very supportive, and she knows that I'm always going to be there for her. I tell her how proud I am of her, and how this is just another battle that she will conquer. But it's taken a big f'ing toll on me. I just feel so bad.

26,04/10/2019,Afraidofothersgettingeatingdisorders,"About eight years ago my sister began suffering from anorexia. I was the first one to notice that she had a problem with food. Her disorder was a horrible strain on our family, as I'm sure is normal for families of eating disorder sufferers, and I think it had a big impact on my development as a teenager. Today though, thank God, she seems to be securely in recovery, and is at a healthy weight. However, despite the fact that my sister and the rest of my family seem to have moved on, I have struggled with this. I live in a different state from my sister and family now, and every time I visit them I find myself having to fight to not monitor every food my sister eats and every time she exercises. Even worse, I struggle to not monitor the food habits of basically all of my friends. Every time I see someone exhibiting an unhealthy attitude toward food, dieting, or exercising, I panic and want to lecture them on creating a healthy relationship with food. And unfortunately, most women in their early twenties don't have a perfect relationship with food, which means I am panicking a lot. Has anyone else experienced this, or does anyone have advice for how to cope with this?","Dear SH,","Dear SH,Oh boy, it really does seem like you were traumatized by your sister's situation.   No doubt about it, home situations, when someone in the family has an ED, can really eat into everyone's life !

Our sensitivity is not a bad quality, and can serve us in good ways in the future, but yeah, we can pay a price for it sometimes too.

Our sensitivity is not a bad quality, and can serve us in good ways in the future, but yeah, we can pay a price for it sometimes too. Because when we have a family member with an ED, it's like what can we do ?  Our sense of control over our environment goes right out the window, which as I'm sure you know, can be a truly unsettling feeling, and in itself can leave us with some real sensitivities.   Sensitivities that can be triggered again, later in life.    To an extent where if we see other people who we think might be heading in a bad direction, it can bring up those panicky feelings again.  At the risk of getting all Sigmund Freud about things, these panicky feelings may somehow relate to the  feelings of loss of control that you had  surrounding your sister. I suspect your remember how unsettling those feelings must have been. Also, we all deserve to get proper attention when we are young, but when someone in the family has a problem, often they are the ones who get all the attention, while  other children are neglected.  Stuff like that can really leave an impression on us too, particularly if we are of an intrinsically sensitive nature.  Almost like a PTSD sort of thing, you know ?And really, we can't just tell ourselves ""Oh don't be so sensitive"".   We are who we are, and it doesn't pay to beat ourselves up about that.At the same time, no one wants to find themselves in a situation where they are being triggered all the time, so I don't think  your concerns are silly at all. Everyone is going to say ""Oh you should get therapy"", but they may have a point.  This sort of stuff is disruptive alright, and it wouldn't hurt to try and figure out what's really at the root of it, and then go from there.   Therapists who advertise themselves as working with trauma and PTSD issues might be the ones to check out.   Not that you were physically abused or anything, but more the part about how disturbing events can really stick with us, you know ?   In ways that really can cause us some legitimate emotional disruption. BobJ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

28,09/17/2018,Understandingmysister/howtohelpher,"My sister has suffered with an ED and depression for many years and she hid it from myself and my family until a few years ago. She was admitted to in patient program for 3 months after she almost dropped out of school due to her ED and it initially helped. It has been a few years since she went to the facility or saw a therapist/psychologist regularly and since then, she has dealt with her ED and depression on her own and I would see her struggle but thought she was doing ok or knew how to handle her emotional upheaval from the therapy she received at the inpatient facility. I did not realize how much she was actually struggling until my girlfriend told me about the obvious signs, i.e. not eating consistently and being obsessive about what she ate, never communicating or being honest about how she was feeling, she would cry when we would go out to eat because she was not in control of her environment or what she could eat, and how skewed our sibling relationship was to an outside perspective. I did not recognize it but she often used me to deal with her emotional turmoil and I was always there to help her out and tell her everything was going to be ok. We never discussed anything serious nor did I ever confront her about her difficulties and not seeking help for them and I thought I was doing the right thing by being there for her. It is incredible difficult to tell her anything because I know how sensitive and emotional she becomes when we do talk about what she is struggling with and therefore I never confronted it. We also come from a family that doesn't talk about emotional issues and instead brushes them off and tries not to think about them and I am the only one in the family that she trusts talking to about her struggles. It has made both of us scared of confrontation and avoid difficult emotional discussions. I thought this was an adequate way to deal with her struggles, help her out when she was struggling, make her laugh and let her call/text me whenever she wanted, until it started causing problems in my relationship with my girlfriend. She would get angry and frustrated because I lacked the perspective to understand that my ""help"" was in turn letting my sister off the hook and leaving me emotionally drained and constantly worried about her well being. My girlfriend told me that I had to change something about my relationship with my sister because it was such a drain on our relationship and it wasn't a healthy way to deal with my sisters ED and depression. I decided, through my girlfriend's suggestions, to only talk to my sister once a week and let her know that she had to seek therapeutic or medical help because I couldn't always be there for her anymore. It was a drastic change to how we talked before but I felt that if I didn't do something drastic, I didn't think she would comprehend the magnitude of her issues and how important it is for her to seek help. It has been several months since I made this change and there seems to be little change on her part; I make sure to tell her she has to seek therapy or talk to someone else about her emotional struggles, even if it is a friend. I also make sure to tell her each week that she has to be more honest with me about what she is going through and if she has sought help. She is in school now and tells me that she is too busy or forgets to call counselors and I know it is her way of avoiding the issue. Each time we talk I confront her and she starts crying and shuts down and doesn't tell me much. I am just wondering what I should do? Do I not talk to her at all to let her know how serious I am that she seeks help? I am being too demanding when I ask her to seek help and not change much on my end? I told her that I will go to therapy too to help understand how to help her and change my way of dealing with confrontation and emotions. I want to keep talking to her but I don't know what to do and I am looking for help on how to talk to my sister and where to go forward from here.","Hi.

You’re situation is very similar to mine.  My sister has been struggling and ED for at least 10 years but she hid it well from the family because she has other health concerns that mask when her ED is taking over.
How has the advice you received on this website and forum helped you?  I’m not sure how to speak to my sister without starting an argument every time we speak. She’s trying to control the way we communicate and my responses to her. She’s openly telling me I want you to speak to me this way not that way, but I don’t think it will help her. I feel like I need to be tough and somewhat motherly but she is telling me she wants me to keep it very light and not discuss her eating disorder. I feel like ignoring her illness and avoiding the subject is the wrong thing to do, but she wants me to trust that she is aware of the steps she needs to take to recover and just keep the conversations superficial.","Hey there,","Hey there,You wrote :","Hey there,You wrote :""I feel like ignoring her illness and avoiding the subject is the wrong thing to do, but she wants me to trust that she is aware of the steps she needs to take to recover and just keep the conversations superficial.""","Hey there,You wrote :""I feel like ignoring her illness and avoiding the subject is the wrong thing to do, but she wants me to trust that she is aware of the steps she needs to take to recover and just keep the conversations superficial.""Just some thoughts, but my  guess would be that your approach  would depend on if she actually is trying to get better or not.  If she seems to be making progress, then ""normal"" conversations that help her  remain in the world (rather than her withdrawing from normal day-to-day interactions ) can be of help, I think.  But if it seems like she's not getting better, and simply want's others to avoid pointing that out to her, so she can proceed with her ED unchallenged, then thats' probably another thing altogether.

At first I would try to help her by listening to her and hugging her and telling her everything would be OK but it got to the point where I started suffering emotionally because I couldn’t handle it anymore. I am a highly emotional person and I also have borderline personality disorder so I started struggling to the point where I was having breakdowns over her problems and realized that I needed to set boundaries for myself. So at the suggestion of my counselor I implemented some boundaries as far as when I was available to talk, consistently reminding her I was not equipped to deal with both her major problems as well as my own, gave her multiple contacts to call, reminded her to see her mental health doctors, etc. but she would keep crossing those boundaries or not doing any of the things I suggested. I also should add that she has been noncompliant with psychotropic medications over the years also because she claims that the side effects are too severe. So as a consequence to that she has lost many psychiatrists  because of their frustration with her. ","I am very new to this which is surprising because my sister is 65 years old.

But her eating disorder is something that never even occurred to me. She would always tell me that she has a very high metabolism and she eats lots of food but she just couldn’t keep on any weight. I have to say that she is so painfully thin you can see her spine and bones protruding from her body.Our year ago she had major back surgery and had a 10 inch rod put in her back for what we all thought was stenosis of the spine. The surgery failed  and ever since then she went on a downward spiral mentally. She suffers from bipolar 1  and OCD. Over the years her mental illness has been managed quite well but the past year she has been in such extreme pain physically which led to her downward emotional spiral into deep depression.I always assumed that we could talk about anything because we always have. I come from a family of six siblings and she and I are the only two that are close. The other siblings are not close to her at all,  because my family has a hard time tolerating her personality based on her constant complaining about her physical pain and depression and also the fact that she alienated most of my siblings many years ago because of things she has said that were hurtful to them. But my relationship with her has always been unique in that we just get along so well and accept each other no matter what.  I must add that I am very close to my siblings and my mother so I feel fortunate in that way but I cannot talk to them about her because they have animosity toward her and so I feel helpless and without support even though I do see my counselor regularly.  I have bipolar and depression also and so we can always relate to each other and have always supported each other throughout the decades. We spent much time together and laughed and always had a deep connection to each other unlike any other I’ve ever experienced. We even know what the other is thinking without even saying anything.After her failed back surgery a year ago, she has been depending on me more and more  in times of crisis, which at times could be multiple times a day. At first I would try to help her by listening to her and hugging her and telling her everything would be OK but it got to the point where I started suffering emotionally because I couldn’t handle it anymore. I am a highly emotional person and I also have borderline personality disorder so I started struggling to the point where I was having breakdowns over her problems and realized that I needed to set boundaries for myself. So at the suggestion of my counselor I implemented some boundaries as far as when I was available to talk, consistently reminding her I was not equipped to deal with both her major problems as well as my own, gave her multiple contacts to call, reminded her to see her mental health doctors, etc. but she would keep crossing those boundaries or not doing any of the things I suggested. I also should add that she has been noncompliant with psychotropic medications over the years also because she claims that the side effects are too severe. So as a consequence to that she has lost many psychiatrists  because of their frustration with her.  So therefore she depended solely on me for crisis intervention on a daily basis and after six  months of that I literally couldn’t take it anymore so I set a boundary that we can have a relationship but I can’t talk about her issues anymore. Her issues being her depression, her financial  difficulties, her severe pain, etc. Nothing I ever said to her helped in anyway.  She saw multiple medical doctors and none of them had any answers.

It finally got to the point where the county had to intervene and she was placed  under their care through the court system and was required to go to doctor appointments and if she did not then she would be placed in a psychiatric facility against her will. She failed the first appointment but they did not check on her until four days after her missed appointment and when they went into her house they found her emaciated,  disoriented, with heart palpitations and found out she had not eaten in a week. So they placed her in the hospital to get her hydrated. After that she was placed in a locked facility for the past 10 days and I was not allowed any contact with her at all and it was breaking my heart in pieces because I just wanted to comfort her but I knew it was for the best.

She always told me that she wished she would gain weight but said she was eating a lot of food (which I never saw her eat because she eats at home alone) and she felt terrible that she was so thin but that’s just the way it works and I took her word for it because my four brothers and my dad are thin also And over the course of the years I have seen them eat a lot and still remain thin because we do tend to have a high metabolism in our family.   To make a long story short, my sister is now going to finally get the help she deserves for her anorexia and bulimia in a place that specializes in those areas. I am holding out hope that she will improve enough so that she can get back home again eventually but I realize  it might take a long time or it may never happen. ","I am very new to this which is surprising because my sister is 65 years old. She has always been extremely thin since she was in her 20s but it wasn’t until a few days ago that I received a diagnosis from a team of doctors that she was suffering from both anorexia and bulimia and has been for about the past 30 years.My sister and I have been extremely close our entire lives and I feel like she is my soulmate and we can talk about anything. But her eating disorder is something that never even occurred to me. She would always tell me that she has a very high metabolism and she eats lots of food but she just couldn’t keep on any weight. I have to say that she is so painfully thin you can see her spine and bones protruding from her body.Our year ago she had major back surgery and had a 10 inch rod put in her back for what we all thought was stenosis of the spine. The surgery failed  and ever since then she went on a downward spiral mentally. She suffers from bipolar 1  and OCD. Over the years her mental illness has been managed quite well but the past year she has been in such extreme pain physically which led to her downward emotional spiral into deep depression.I always assumed that we could talk about anything because we always have. I come from a family of six siblings and she and I are the only two that are close. The other siblings are not close to her at all,  because my family has a hard time tolerating her personality based on her constant complaining about her physical pain and depression and also the fact that she alienated most of my siblings many years ago because of things she has said that were hurtful to them. But my relationship with her has always been unique in that we just get along so well and accept each other no matter what.  I must add that I am very close to my siblings and my mother so I feel fortunate in that way but I cannot talk to them about her because they have animosity toward her and so I feel helpless and without support even though I do see my counselor regularly.  I have bipolar and depression also and so we can always relate to each other and have always supported each other throughout the decades. We spent much time together and laughed and always had a deep connection to each other unlike any other I’ve ever experienced. We even know what the other is thinking without even saying anything.After her failed back surgery a year ago, she has been depending on me more and more  in times of crisis, which at times could be multiple times a day. At first I would try to help her by listening to her and hugging her and telling her everything would be OK but it got to the point where I started suffering emotionally because I couldn’t handle it anymore. I am a highly emotional person and I also have borderline personality disorder so I started struggling to the point where I was having breakdowns over her problems and realized that I needed to set boundaries for myself. So at the suggestion of my counselor I implemented some boundaries as far as when I was available to talk, consistently reminding her I was not equipped to deal with both her major problems as well as my own, gave her multiple contacts to call, reminded her to see her mental health doctors, etc. but she would keep crossing those boundaries or not doing any of the things I suggested. I also should add that she has been noncompliant with psychotropic medications over the years also because she claims that the side effects are too severe. So as a consequence to that she has lost many psychiatrists  because of their frustration with her.  So therefore she depended solely on me for crisis intervention on a daily basis and after six  months of that I literally couldn’t take it anymore so I set a boundary that we can have a relationship but I can’t talk about her issues anymore. Her issues being her depression, her financial  difficulties, her severe pain, etc. Nothing I ever said to her helped in anyway.  She saw multiple medical doctors and none of them had any answers.  Fast forward to about two months ago and it finally reached a point where  I had to reach out to professionals to learn how to cope with both loving her and being angry and resentful that she was putting me into the position of being her sole emotional support, which I am not equipped to do. I have my own issues and I also I am under the care of a psychiatrist and a counselor and do very well but I cannot handle someone else’s major issues as well as my own. Because my sister lived alone and was begging me to help her and telling me that she couldn’t eat because her throat was so irritated and acid was coming out and her pain was unbearable and none of her doctors were helping her and she didn’t know what to do anymore I finally had to reach out to the police department and the officer told me that whenever she had a crisis I needed to call for them to do a welfare check. So the first time that happened, a couple months ago, I did that and she was sent to a mental health facility but she quickly got out after 24 hours saying it was a horrible place and they didn’t understand her at all and it made things worse. Then she would go back home alone and the next day be in crisis again and reach out to me again and I would try to talk to her and give her suggestions and advice which she would not take.   So what ultimately happened is that in the last two months I have called to have a welfare check for her about four times and each time they would put her in a mental health facility and she would get out after a couple days and be just as bad or worse. It finally got to the point where the county had to intervene and she was placed  under their care through the court system and was required to go to doctor appointments and if she did not then she would be placed in a psychiatric facility against her will. She failed the first appointment but they did not check on her until four days after her missed appointment and when they went into her house they found her emaciated,  disoriented, with heart palpitations and found out she had not eaten in a week. So they placed her in the hospital to get her hydrated. After that she was placed in a locked facility for the past 10 days and I was not allowed any contact with her at all and it was breaking my heart in pieces because I just wanted to comfort her but I knew it was for the best.   The facility told me that this is their protocol because when someone is in such physical and mental distress it is imperative that they get acute care without the intervention of family members at the beginning so I understand that completely. I got a call finally yesterday from her team of doctors and they determined that they did a full evaluation and diagnosed her with  both anorexia and bulimia and it is extremely advanced. I almost fell on the floor in shock.  I didn’t know!!  How could I have not made the connection?

I am holding out hope that she will improve enough so that she can get back home again eventually but I realize  it might take a long time or it may never happen. What I want people to take out of my comment is that even someone you were extremely close to for many years, you can be completely in the dark about the fact that they have an eating disorder.  This is the first time I have ever known someone with an eating disorder so it is all new to me  even though I have seen documentaries on the subject. So if anyone who has a loved one who is suffering from anorexia or bulimia or both, please know that it was nothing you did or didn’t do that may have prevented them from getting proper treatment  and there was nothing you could have done to fix them on your own. I realize now that what I did for her by continually calling for welfare check was the best thing I could’ve ever done for her even though at the time I thought I was being a monster.  No she is in a safe environment where they are starting the  process of treating her eating disorder. It will start with her admitting that she has an eating disorder and then it will go from there to actually treating the disorder itself.","I am very new to this which is surprising because my sister is 65 years old.

 Thank you for sharing your story. My sister hid her eating disorder very well for about 15 years.

29,03/13/2019,Feelsohopeless,"Hello and welcome to the forum.  I am so sorry to hear about your sister and your story.  Thank you for sharing. You did an excellent job at explaining what you have been through with your sister.  You are correct in saying you are not to blame.  I understand you may feel ""how did I not know?""  But your sister was clever in lying and deceiving all.  You did the right thing in getting her help.  It is up to HER to decide if she is going to keep up with what she will learn in treatment. You are doing what is good for you in setting boundaries.  Boundaries are a sign of love believe it or not.  It forces the one who is ill to utilize the help that is there for her and will help keep your relationship healthy.  You are correct in saying you are not able to carry her and you.  As difficult as it has been for you to get her the help she needs, you did the loving thing, even if she is angry with you for it. I am really proud of you for loving your sister enough to do the difficult things you have done for her, and for yourself.  Please know we are here for you.  I am glad you posted.  You have been through a lot and as you said you are both older and it makes recovery a bit more challenging. I am 51 and after thirty plus years of suffering am now in recovery.  So it is possible. I relied on my faith in Jesus and my parents support and my friends.  So.  Again, I am glad you posted and shared your story.  Please let us know how things go.

30,12/09/2018,Shouldworryaboutmy16yobrother?,"Hi everybody, My name is CC. I'm 20 and I live at college about half an hour away from my family. I'm worried about my 16yo brother. He's grown very tall and skinny in a very short amount of time. He was a chubby child, and my mom and his soccer coaches used to bother him about it and encourage him to work out more often and eat more healthy. He counted calories for a bit, lost weight, gained muscle and became a very accomplished athlete. They were kind of mean about it though, and I worry the criticism may have negatively affected him and made him obsessive. He doesn't often join us for meals, although I'm not home super often. He eats sort of secretly in the middle of the night, and if I ask my parents if he eats enough, they say he just eats in the middle of the night. This again, might just be what a teenage boy does. However he also is very sensitive about eating food. He will snap at me if I ask, even jokingly, if he eats enough. Over the last year, he has grown very thin and he exercises very often. He plays tennis very seriously and goes to the gym several times a week. This definitely could just be that he's growing very fast and wants to be fit. I know our mom feeds him a big breakfast (I haven't personally been up early enough to see if he eats it. I assume he does or my mom would be worried.) He completely skips lunch at school but usually (according to my mom) eats a big snack when he gets back. A few weeks ago, he actually passed out when he didn't eat an after school snack and fell down the stairs, which scared my dad. My brother, like my mom, passed out a lot as a kid from talking about blood or getting a shot, and I believe his blood pressure is low. Everybody has a different story. My brother claims he didn't pass out from hunger, but instead tripped and hit his head and passed out. My dad claims he had a seizure (which nobody has any history of, and my dad hasn't seen my brother pass out often enough to know what it looks like). My mom believes it was from hunger because he didn't eat all day and plays sports after school. Everybody was freaked out, but it hasn't happened again, and it just got kind of dropped. He doesn't seem to avoid certain kinds of food too much. He certainly doesn't like sweets as much as he used to, and he won't usually indulge in dessert. He obsesses a little over not eating too much junk although he definitely could afford to. Again, this could just be a health-conscious teen. On their own, none of these are entirely concerning (except maybe passing out, but he has always passed out very easily, and the reason is debated). However, this morning I found a bottle under the sink of knock-off weight loss pills that look too sketchy for my parents to have purchased them. When I asked my mom, she said that nobody had claimed them. Since my dad has no reason to hide them, they belong to my brother. I don't have any experience with eating disorders, and the evidence doesn't seem solid enough to bring up to my mom. On top of that, my parents are weird and uncomfortable about mental health problems (I hid my own seasonal depression and anxiety from them through high school and only found a therapist in college). If I bring it up to my brother incorrectly, he will become defensive. He and I have a pretty good relationship, but he sometimes shuts down about certain topics if he isn't in a great mood. I don't think he would confide in me if he were having self image problems. I will be home for winter break for about 5 weeks where I will see him every day, so I will be able to see whats going on. Should I be concerned or am I worrying too much? What should I do? Thanks for your help, CC","Hi.  Thank you for posting and for caring so much about your brother.  There does seem to be some reason for concern.  I am not a professional, but I think he should at least be seen by a medical doctor, just to make sure everything is okay, especially since your dad thinks he had a seizure and the fact that he passed out.  Then the doctor can further investigate to see if there are any other possible medical problems, and will know if his weight is not in a healthy range.  I am sorry you had to go through struggles with depression alone.  That must have been difficult.  It is odd that he is eating at night.  He may be embarrassed to be seen eating.  There is a parent tool kit on the forum, and it may help you if you look through it.  Please keep us posted.  Anytime someone is concerned about a loved one, even if nothing is wrong, it is never wrong to seek help or ask questions and make sure that loved one is okay.  Denial is a huge part of an eating disorder.  So he may not answer truthfully.  That is part of the illness.  So it is okay to be asking questions and for being concerned.  I wish you the best.","Hi.  Thank you for posting and for caring so much about your brother.  There does seem to be some reason for concern.

31,08/10/2018,11yearoldsisterisstartingtoshowsignsofaneatingdisorder,"<p>hi, my name is diana and im 14 years old at the moment. my little sister told me just last night that she was depressed and had been eating less and less for a while. i didn't know to what extent, so i told her that the first thing she needed to do was tell me what she had eaten that day. she told me what she ate, i thought that was fine so i asked her if that's what her usual meals consisted of, and she told me no. she said that she usually eats only a little bit before going to sleep. to put some context into what i'm about to say, my little sister uses my mom's phone to text &amp; call her friends. today, i asked her how long she had had this problem with her weight. she told me that she had been bullied since 4th grade about multiple things, but mostly her physical appearance. eventually, she got to the point of staring at herself in the mirror and pointing out her flaws. the first thing she saw was her stomach. that's where it started. so, she let me read some of the texts she sent her friends, and the date that she told them about it was July 28th, 2018. her message read, ""for a few months now i've been dealing with something and i think i should tell you."" i'm worried that this has been going on for a long time and i don't know what to do. if anyone has any answers or suggestions, please please feel free to comment or reply. i need to do something, but i don't know what approach i should take.</p>","Hi.  Is sounds like you have an amazing relationship with your younger sister.  It does sound as if she may be in the beginning stages of developing an eating disorder and if she is concerned enough to reach out to her friends and you I would want to suggest you tell her you are concerned and you need to talk to a parent of both if you can. Eating disorders are serious and life threatening and if caught early the early intervention can prevent a life time of suffering and serious consequences.  I would let her know you plan on telling a parent or someone you trust so she doesn't feel betrayed but I think she is asking for help and is scared herself.  The best thing you can do for her is to let someone know who can bring her in for an assessment and  get her help.  The best approach is letting an adult preferably a parent know and if nothing is done or it isn't taken seriously then let someone else know.  This isn't something that is easy to deal with and you are in a position that you may not want to be in.  But now that you know, you are right, you need to do something.  You sound like you love your sister. I am sorry she is suffering.  You too are young and to be in this position is difficult.  I wish you the best and hope that you let us know how things go.  Take care, I hope this helped you some.","Hi.  Is sounds like you have an amazing relationship with your younger sister.

It is so wonderful that she opened up about this, that she realizes it is bad and that she seems to be looking for help. Her chances of recovery are higher the earlier she gets help and having you and the rest of her family involved in her treatment therapies has been shown to also give her the best chances for recovery. This is a serious condition, be brave in getting help from a trusted adult if you haven't already. Stay strong, it is not easy to see someone you love hurting this way.","Hi diana, I hope you have been able to get your sister some help.

32,08/20/2018,Howtotalktomysister,"Hi! I hope you don't mind me coming to this forum as I'm actually the sibling with the ED. I need to talk to my family, but need some advice so I was hoping y'all could help give me some perspective. My ED started about 7 years ago, but I've been in recovery for almost two years with a few rough patches here and there. It started towards the end of high school and I did everything I could to hide it from my parents-I think they suspected something, but we just don't communicate in our family so nothing was said to me. My sister was away at school so I definitely don't think she knew anything was going on. I left for college and that's where my friends took over. When I had breakdowns or had to go to the hospital or anything they were the ones I let be there for me. I hate that I lied to my family about so much and hid everything, but I didn't want them to know because I was ashamed. Now that I truly feel I'm doing better I have to get this burden off my chest and tell them, but I'm still scared. Do you, as siblings, have any advice for me? I'm going to try to talk to my older sister first because she's actually a therapist so maybe she can give me some advice on how to handle my family as well, especially knowing their personalities. (Though I'm kind of scared she'll go all 'therapist' on me which has driven a wedge between us before just in normal situations so I really don't want her to do it now. So if there's someone that can relate and has any advice, I'm listening.) One other thing is she and I live a few hours away so I don't know how to meet with her because I really want to do it somewhere private, not at a restaurant or anything. Any suggestions there? Any advice really and I would be appreciative!! Thank you!!","Rea-rea,","Rea-rea,Sorry your post sat here for a while.

It can be a slow process figuring out what triggers and what is helpful as sometimes these things can even appear to be dynamic in nature in some cases.A major issue in the house of course is food. Initially I would eat out a lot.. or not eat myself hardly at all and never around her as this seemed to trigger horrible binge / purge cycles. I don't want this for her of course so I reacted by making changes. But as finances struggled I found myself eating cheaper things like bread at home more. But anything food related I bought into the house was gone before I could eat it myself so I went along barely eating or eating out in cheaper ways. I then decided I would only purchase healthy items.. fruits, veg, eggs etc. in the home, so that if she takes them the night at least she's getting whatever nutrients she can from them before purging. So I did that lately, she didn't take everything but most of it. The food in the house not being enough of course, (despite her being in pain from fullness)she'd go out and eat more taking my money or money from our dual account and spend insane amounts over time. She was always very specific about what food she binges on and none of it is cheap. She doesn't work herself and I'm helping her get through school but we can barely pay rent because of this issue. Recently I resorted to making my own account and explaining that I understand she can't seem to help these urges but I can't have her spending our money for rent on this. Doing this has caused huge arguments.. accusations of mistrust etc. She thinks I'm being controlling etc. I decided recently to give her a certain amount of money for food a week she can spend how she chooses but she spent it all straight away and then had nothing to eat and started acting like I was starving her and being abusive. So I've just bought her food myself in reasonable amounts but she's been taking that and also borrowing off friends and family for the extra binges and hiding them. I really don't know if the way I'm approached things is the right thing to do, she is making me feel like a controlling monster and our relationship is really suffering for it.

We knew each other online before so I was aware of her issues going in and have tried to be as understanding and helpful as possible along the way. As anyone with a partner who struggles with an ED will well know, it can feel sometimes like you are doing everything wrong or saying the wrong thing in the wrong way a million different times. It can be a slow process figuring out what triggers and what is helpful as sometimes these things can even appear to be dynamic in nature in some cases.A major issue in the house of course is food. Initially I would eat out a lot.. or not eat myself hardly at all and never around her as this seemed to trigger horrible binge / purge cycles. I don't want this for her of course so I reacted by making changes. But as finances struggled I found myself eating cheaper things like bread at home more. But anything food related I bought into the house was gone before I could eat it myself so I went along barely eating or eating out in cheaper ways. I then decided I would only purchase healthy items.. fruits, veg, eggs etc. in the home, so that if she takes them the night at least she's getting whatever nutrients she can from them before purging. So I did that lately, she didn't take everything but most of it. The food in the house not being enough of course, (despite her being in pain from fullness)she'd go out and eat more taking my money or money from our dual account and spend insane amounts over time. She was always very specific about what food she binges on and none of it is cheap. She doesn't work herself and I'm helping her get through school but we can barely pay rent because of this issue. Recently I resorted to making my own account and explaining that I understand she can't seem to help these urges but I can't have her spending our money for rent on this. Doing this has caused huge arguments.. accusations of mistrust etc. She thinks I'm being controlling etc. I decided recently to give her a certain amount of money for food a week she can spend how she chooses but she spent it all straight away and then had nothing to eat and started acting like I was starving her and being abusive. So I've just bought her food myself in reasonable amounts but she's been taking that and also borrowing off friends and family for the extra binges and hiding them. I really don't know if the way I'm approached things is the right thing to do, she is making me feel like a controlling monster and our relationship is really suffering for it. I guess I was just wondering how others with partners with a similar binge/purge ED handle food in the house and if anyone has better ways of dealing with this. I feel like everything I do or try is wrong and makes everything worse. :(Don","Don,","Don,Yep, the ""binge haul"" thing, as the girls often call it.

34,08/05/2018,Iamclosetoabreakingpoint,"This will be quite long and lengthy just to note in advance. So my younger 15 year old sister has been dealing with an eating disorder for about two years now. It all started in the fall of 2016 when she tried taking her life and everything has been downhill since then. She suffered with the eating disorder right after that and for a while life was bad for her, that was until she became apart of a teen program which made her find a hobby and what me and my whole family thought was going to help her on a road to recovery. At the time she was 14 and became friends with a 19 year old boy there and he'd come to the house and it was just all really good for, but me and my mom and dad (i was 17 at the time 18 now just incase anyone wonders) would tell her you know its wrong to ever do anything right? And her response was always very reassuring and she told she would never and that doing anything with him would be gross and wrong, but unfortunately we found out they were a couple and she never would have told us if it weren't for my mom finding out :( so we were back to going downhill again. Unfortunately there was more stuff with him and multiple times of her running away and another attempt at killing herself and she was off to residential. During that time when she was gone I felt very guilty for loving the time she was away because we'd all be at peace. A few months later she told me how she had relationships with a bunch of guys in that teen program and they were boys who knew me and who were older then me and I just couldn't believe it. I had become a tattle tale and a snitch because when she would tell me things I would just have to tell my family because she puts herself in danger. She has become a huge liar and a very convincing one as well. She takes a lot of my things without asking me and thats created a huge strain on our relationship. I'll express to her how much I don't like that she takes my things and it got to the point my parents put a lock on my door. But everytime she takes my things she is so convincing and makes me believe it won't happen again so I don't lock my door and then she does it again and it messes with my head. A few examples would be her taking a very expensive make up product of mine and genuinely driving me insane because I can't find it anywhere and I thought i lost it for months and a week ago she gave it to me and apologized because she said it happened when she wasn;t eating a lot and couldn't remember hiding it, but she lies so much I don't know what to believe. And before I explain the next part I need to explain that I do smoke to help cope with anxiety and panic attacks sometimes and so one night I went to go get my smokes and it was gone and I was so shocked because I never ever forget to put it back in my bag so I got to her and I ask her if she took it and she tells me no and then I ask her if she'll check outside with me and she got very very defensive and told me no. Then she also told me and god I can't believe what a good actor she was but she said ""well you misplaced your makeup so you probably just misplaced your smokes."" And i went to my room so confused and then it just hit me and I went into her room and demanded she give me it back over and over and then she finally did. She's been smoking a lot and my parents keep catching her doing it and flushing it she has down the toilet and telling her no more! You are going to hurt yourself mentally if you keep using it to cope. Right now I just don't know what to do. My parents are on the verge of divorcing because this is becoming something they can't cope with together and I am so angry at my sister and I know my feelings are valid and I'm not alone but it's so hard to try and be there for her when she lies so so much and puts herself in danger with older men. I feel like it is all her fault and I feel like she loves having so much control over all of us. It is hurting so much. What has happened has made us cancel a huge family trip, is ruining my parents relationship, has made my anxiety and depression so much worse and it just sucks so much. I miss my old sister shes changed so so much and i miss the old me too. I just miss the happy family dynamic we once had and I can't even remember the good times anymore just the bad. My house just has a dark cloud around it and it is so sad here we are all so sad. And right now I have become a punching bag for everyone. When my mom has to deal with my sisters eating disorder and then my anxiety she can freak out on me a lot because her tolerance is wearing thin or if she gets into fights with my sister or my dad she'll freak out on me. This past weel has been the worst of me getting the short end of the stick. If anyone could help me or tell me I'm not alone or literally anything it would be appreciated.","Hi vital, welcome to the NEDA forums.

35,08/01/2018,littlesistercomingtovisit,"Hi everybody,
I have just been informed by my mom that my younger sister (she's 18) is suffering from an eating disorder, she severely limits her food intake and has been isolating herself from her friends and what not. i do not live at home with my family so I have not actually experienced this first hand, however my sister is coming to visit me for 10 days starting next week and I am really worried about how to help her. I want my living environment to be as comfortable for her as possible and I don't want her to feel any pressure from me during meal times, however I will likely be doing most of the cooking. I also live in a very unique food-hub so prior to my knowledge of her ED I had booked a few reservations at neat little places for us.
Basically I am just wondering what I can do to best support her and if I should keep these restaurant reservations, etc etc. I am totally out of my league in dealing with this so any advice would be greatly appreciated!!
Thank you so much","Hi.   It is kind of you to be wondering how to best help your sister.  I am sorry she is suffering.  Maybe if you read on NEDA web site on the information pages about how to help loved ones, and just familiarize yourself a little on eating disorders in general before she comes that will help you some.  Also, don't be afraid to ask your sister what she is comfortable with.  Ask her if she wants to eat out or not.   I wouldn't cater to her every desire if she isn't eating much.  I would try to be as normal around food as you usually are and then ask her if she wants anything in addition to what you have already planned.  She may be anxious about the whole food deal with three meals a day.  But I would still plan for the three meals.  If she chooses not to eat and wants to excuse herself I wouldn't try to convince her beyond an Are you sure? and then leave it at that.  That is just my suggestion.  Someone else may think differently.  I wouldn't mention anything about how she looks.  Like you look good or something along those lines.  Say something about what she is wearing or her hair or something neutral.  Ask questions that don't revolve around the eating disorder unless she brings it up.  Ask how school is going, what she is doing with her summer, work, those kinds of things.  If she wants to discuss the eating disorder and she feels you are open to talking with her, she very well may.  Ask her if you can ask her questions.  Let her be in control of the whole eating disorder stuff.  I would make yourself available to her but wouldn't try to pry or push her to talk if she isn't ready.  Meal times may be awkward, but try to be calm and as easy going as you can.  Since you don't know much about where she is at it makes it a little more challenging.  I hope this helps you some.  Just be her sister.  Treat her as you always did.  Ten days is a long time.  Post here as you need and let us know how things are going.  I didn't see your post before today, Sunday.  So sorry for the delay.  I wish you the best.  It is good to see how you care about your sister and want her to be comfortable.  Take care,","Hi.

My sister has been dealing with an eating disorder for a while now (she’s 23 like me) and her problem really started when she attended a university. I currently go to a community college, but I’m going to attend a 4 year university as a visiting student this fall semester. I know this might sound crazy, but I am really worried that something bad might happen to me, just like it happened to my sister with her eating disorder. I really wanna go to experience something new and make some new friends, but I’m very afraid. Thanks for listening :)","Welcome to the forums, and thank you for posting.

I am glad you posted.  I am really sorry your sister developed her eating disorder while at college.  Or at all for that matter.  Seeing her suffer has to be difficult.   I know you know this but you are not your sister and her experience does not have to by yours.  I don't know what happened to cause her to develop the eating disorder.  Maybe she wasn't ready to go away.  But you are and you want to go and explore the freedoms of being at a four year university, making new friends and taking on new challenges.  Try to focus on all that awaits you. All the new and exciting experiences you will have.  I hear the concern and the fear.  Try talking about it with a friend if you feel comfortable.  Write about your fears and then go out to the university and live.  Try not to allow the worry to grow and become greater than it is.  Fear has a way of doing that.  Your experience does not have to be what your sisters was.  You are in two different places.  Two different people.  I know you know this.  But I don't want to minimize your feelings.   They are real.  If you work through them before you attend, hopefully the fear will be smaller than it is now and it will be something in the back of your mind instead of in the front.  I hope this helped some.  I want you to enjoy your life and know that because your sister got sick it doesn't have to happen to you and you do not need to feel guilty for enjoying your life.  It is okay to be well.  It is healthy for you to move on with your life.  You can still be there for your sister if you want to be, but go ahead and live your life.  It is your time to fly.

My best suggestion, seeing that you seem to understand how drastically your sister's life has been affected by her ED, is to take note of these disadvantages each time you might feel certain triggering thoughts (which might be helpful to do some research on to recognize). It's more difficult to notice your own symptoms and match them to that of an ED than to see them in another. If it's helpful, begin to log your food intake along with how you feel during each time you eat so you can notice these changes in your mood as you eat.
What I try to remember when I slip into my old habits is of how much I am enjoying in my more balanced life without such stress over food versus what my fatigue and anxiety prevented me from doing while I had my eating disorder. It's a difficult concept to grasp without having experienced it, but as I mentioned previously, comparing your sister's post-ED and pre-ED life might be helpful in this way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

39,03/11/2018,TheElaphantintheroom,"Hi, my younger sister has been battling an eating disorder since the age of 16. She has been managing over the years ( pretending to manager for the most part) she is raising 3 teenagers. Since our Mom passed away 2 years ago she lost a lot of weight. I haven't seen her in a year, however my older sister has and has kept it from me how deteriorated she has become. I saw her a few days ago and was speachless. I called her husband to chat and he just laughted, he said welcome to my life. She is refusing help, I suggested an introvention and my older sister said it wont work. She lives far from me but I said I want to help or shes going to die and no one else seems to want my help? Im extremely frustrated and sad that no one has asked for my help let alone have seeked outside help. I called a therapist in her town who is willing to help but my brother in law is avoinding me. I suggested to him to talk to the therapist himself to better help his wife. They used to go to church every Sunday and have stopped going 9 months ago. I told him also my sister needs fellowship and other women to lift her up, as she is a stay a home mom and has no one in the daytime to talk to.
All I want to do is help, I spoke to my sister directly too and told her I love her and dont want her to die. She is mow avoiding me too.

And remember, you are not responsible for her.  She is.  That is difficult to hear but it is true.  Until she gets to the point where she is able to make decisions, because sometimes malnutrition takes that away from someone and they are unable to make decisions or see how bad they are, which is when medical intervention needs to take place, getting that person medically stable and capable of making clear decisions, that is when she becomes responsible again for making choices.  Did I just confuse you?  I hope not.  But you are not responsible for the choices she has made. Painful to watch, yes, same with my sister.  Will my sister die?  Maybe.  But I can not change her anymore than you can change your sister.  These are just the hard facts of living with someone who is not making good choices.  I hope I have not depressed you.  I am wanting to let you know how special you are and how blessed your sister is to have you even if she doesn't know it.  The tears, the frustration, the fear.  I understand.

It isn't easy but with the support of a few amazing friends and a husband it can be possible.I'm happy I found this forum for support.,Thank you so very much for your words of love and support.

So Im supporting her the only way I know how and Im putting her at the feet of Gods grace and praying for her veil to be lifted, praying for her to open her heart to discern truth beyond all understanding.  I still talk to her 3 times a week and I keep letting her know I love her and if she wants to pray with me Im here. Jesus promises us: where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.

I know it isn't easy.  I am having to do the same thing with my sister who lives with me but I never see her because she stays in her room all day and all night suffering from ailments that don't need to be keeping her so isolated.   She is choosing for whatever reason to isolate herself and not be part of this home.  Being that she is right in the house is sad, frustrating and maddening.  So I understand it isn't easy to hand someone over to God but it IS the best choice when the said person isn't responding to any attempts to our encouragement.   Be sure to take care of yourself during this time.  You need care too.  I am sorry she is so ill and not wanting to get help.  I was that way for decades.  I would ask for prayer and be binging while the person on the phone was praying for me.  How sad is that.  But that is how eating disorders operate.  Until one wants help.   Help is difficult to find.  You are a kind sister who wants what is best for her sister.  She is lucky to have you even if she doesn't realize it yet.  Take care,
                                                                                 iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,02/15/2018,Ifeellikei'velostmysister,"six months ago my sister was diagnosed with an eating  disorder and since then I feel like my family has been turned upside down. I have two sisters, the oldest of which was like my best friend, but since she has been diagnosed she has completely changed. Before she was diagnosed we would do everything together and I could talk to her about anything, but in recent months she treats me like I don't exist. Most of the time I try to have a conversation with her, she screams at me and tells me to leave her alone or will completely ignore what I say. The worst part is, my mums whole life is now consumed with my sister, and it feels like myself and my younger sister no longer matter. My mum has started to miss my little sisters school plays and our parents evening(something she would never have done previously)and has started to spend less and less time with us. I've tried to speak to my mum about it but she says she has to do anything she can right now to help my sister get better and that we all have to try and be thoughtful towards my sister. the thing is, I know I should be trying to understand but I can't help but be so angry at her. her whole life revolves around calories and she has started to call my little sister and me disgusting for eating any food that she considers fattening. And because my mum is so worried about her, all her attention has now transferred to her, leaving me feeling like I am having to be a sister and a mother to my little sister.
My biggest worry is that my little sister is starting to copy her behaviour. I have noticed her using a fitness app and checking the amount of calories she intakes. I'm so worried that my sisters behaviour is rubbing off on her and I'm worried that she soon will develop an eating disorder. I have spoken to my mum about it but she seems to think she is doing it to gain attention.

I am so sorry for what you are going though.  It breaks my heart.  It is painful to see what an eating disorder can do to the sufferer and the family.   I have no magic words but only that you are not alone.  Your sister is probably terrified.  Very reactive due to the severity of her fear of weight gain.  For you feeling abandoned by your mom and you taking on the position of ""mothering"" your little sister, again, painful.  Do you have any friends who can support you with what you are going through?  About protecting your little sister from falling into the same trap, talk with her about things outside of what she looks like and more on what she accomplishes.    Otherwise she may think she needs thinness to be her barometer of how she feels about herself.  It is difficult and painful and scary to think she may fall into the eating disorder trap.   What about family counseling?  Do you think anyone would be willing?   ","Hi.  I am so sorry for what you are going though.  It breaks my heart.

I have an older sister whose bulimia rocked my childhood, too. It was a horribly traumatic and cruel experience for me in which she made me guess what her issue was (I was just 9 years old) and harbor the secret for over a year until I couldn't bear it any more. Once my family was aware of her ED, she would use it to manipulate my parents and often engaged in behaviors after fights. My home became Eggshell Central when she was around. I just remember so much trauma and dysfunction. I have vivid memories of my brother taking me by the hand and pulling me away from the chaos on multiple occasions. I know my parents were out of their element and doing the best they could, but what I would do to go back and tell them I needed support, too.
Although she has since recovered from her ED, she went on to become an alcoholic (now >10 years sober) and that had a profound impact on me and my family as well. And while we're all thrilled that she's happy and healthy, I just cannot fathom how my loving and otherwise ""normal"" family has glossed over the fact that she spent over a decade in my family disguised as a reckless tornado. As if her recoveries have voided all the pain and burden we've all shared together and individually. So, in a different but similar way, I hear you and I feel your pain. You are not alone.
Have you thought about therapy? Perhaps a therapist could help you navigate the next steps. I guess you need to ask yourself what you want out of this, too. I recently started therapy and this was something I had buried deep down but something that has also had a surprising affect on many other aspects of my life. It's been very helpful to talk about it and I imagine your family members are harboring similar feelings and resentments. And please understand that you are entitled to feel exactly what you're feeling. I hope my message is in some way validating. It's difficult and taxing to be a silent victim. I'm here for you if you need to talk. Stay strong!","To everyone who has posted - thank you! I feel I relate to what you all said, and I'm hoping the best for all you and all of your families. My older sister was sick with an eating disorder and I relate to feeling angry along the course of her illness and recover. This anger was a big surprise for me- I was expecting relief and happiness, and I felt confused that I hanging onto bitterness for all of the hard times my family had been through because of the eating disorder.

That's incredibly intuitive and I really respect that you reached out for help and are taking time to clearly think this through. Feeling angry at the havoc eating disorders create in a family is valid and natural, and for me, it has been very important to remember that none of our siblings chose their illness. They are as much a victim of their illness as we are over their illness. Take care of yourself first, and don't give up on your sister! For me, family therapy and talking to my sister was good in the long term, and I recommend having a support system available to you when you do. Wishing you the very best!
