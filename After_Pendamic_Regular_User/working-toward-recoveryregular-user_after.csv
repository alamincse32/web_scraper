2,ev.1234,10/20/2021,I feel trapped and don't know how to stop,"I have an eating disorder. I have always had body dysmorphia and have had bad thoughts about eating since I was young, but I was able to pretty much push those thoughts aside and maintain a normal eating lifestyle. It wasn't until sophomore year when I dropped a significant amount of weight (due to stressful situations) that my mindset changed. At first when I lost the weight I knew it was unhealthy so the summer after my sophomore year I worked on rebuilding my body and I ate normally and enjoyed exercising. That summer I had the healthiest relationship with food and my body, and it has been the last time I have ever had a healthy relationship with food. That was the summer of 2019. When returning to school, I was healthy at first, but then I had the constant desire to lose weight and be skinnier than all my friends. So I heavily restricted almost all foods and again I lost a vast amount of weight. I kept on my restriction until quarantine. When quarantine hit I told myself that it'd be really hard to restrict myself without going to school and being at home all day. During quarantine I would severely restrict myself and then binge and repeat. I am still stuck in the loop of restriction and binging and I want to change my brain so bad. I know that binging comes from restriction, but even when I'm not restricting my brain wants me to keep eating until I'm sick. I am just confused and looking for advice on how to change my mindset and lifestyle because my eating disorder has brainwashed me and has become a habit.

3,2Healthy4me,10/18/2020," My Slew of Daily Vitamins, and by the way, … i Feel Flat as an Emory Board...","So I had a rather efficient breakfast, and a nice beverage after awakening. Weighed myself 1st thing after relieving my bladder this morning. Feeling upset that my weight is still rising. I am trying so hard to keep physical while @ work, as well as for my daily walking routines, not over eating, and usually Not snacking on Hi Cal foods or snacks.But according to the d--- scale my body weight is resisting my need to feel in control of obesity. Last week couldn't walk due to my fall on the stairs. Then the heat kept me from walking earlier and it seems to get dark outside even though the temperature is finally at the level which I allow myself to do outdoor exercise at.
So, even that is out of my control. I messed up on doing a rather complicated register transaction so now my new employer told me to Not do the same transaction again. In a way that is a relief, as most the people who I ever have to deal with in doing returns always seem somewhat disgruntled upon entering the store, or returning out of retaliation or something regarding their feelings towards the people working here.I experienced  another shoplifter run out of the store again. Another assistant  manager screamed and gave verbal command to call the police in lieu of just Quietly and Discreetly calling them themselves. These people are paid a lot more than the regular cashier and stock staff. So I feel that they need to go through a security training on how t use smart phone technology to use them as they witness an event causing them to feel the need to chase and scream loudly in the store, which is stressful for me to deal with.My last job in retail always have had at least 1 security guard that was at the front door checking baggage of customers exiting daily from the store. It's requires at least 1 trained guard. Cashiers having to take attention off the customer being served is really annoying, and should really be unnecessary. Really, at least the managing staff should be as well versed on how to discreetly use smart phones for asset protection as they are trained to look up the price or location of the stock on sales floor.It can all be done with 1 store smartphone, but requires an additional training in the use of dialing out police, as well as in how to take discreet security photos to acquire proof of their accusations for yelling and chasing these locals out of the store swiftly....Now on 1st of a few days off from work and feel like if I don't eat until I'm stuffed as a bell pepper and feel pain in stomach to remind my self that I am still alive, though totally quiet and isolated at home here in my doll house like apartment. I am still sheltering from covid,  and avoiding neighborhood pools, malls, driving somewhere else other than being here at home alone paying bills, and doing online, fantasy,  ""window shopping""....Or Not eat all day and continue to feel numb and isolated.....like,  a Bad boy on house arrest.",boylejake,"Sun,11/21/2021-10:58am",You shouldn't see food as the,"You shouldn't see food as the enemy.

11,Braviary18,10-09-21,Simple meal ideas?,"This is my first time posting on a forum like this, I'm really nervous to submit this but I'd really appreciate some help or feedback or even some kind words.I struggled with bulimia for a couple years in college. It started with dieting and counting calories until it progressed to throwing up almost all day long, everyday. I was always hungry and the only thing I could think about was what food I was going to eat next and how I would purge. I tried stopping at various times, but could never quite fully pull myself out of the hole I dug around me. I dated a few guys in that time and each time they found out, they were really angry with me and the relationship would end shortly after. I felt like a ticking time bomb.One day I started dating the guy of my dreams, a guy I had a crush on since I was 14 and it turned out he liked me the whole time too. I decided to fully quit bulimia. Of course I had some slip-ups in the first week of trying, but eventually I stopped puking. I had to learn how to eat fast and sugary food again without feeling sick. I had to learn how much food was a normal amount because I hadn't felt full in years. The first time I felt full and let myself digest my food I cried because it had been so long since I felt 'normal'.I started recovery on my own, but after I felt confident eating and digesting food I eventually told my boyfriend and he was perfectly wonderful about it. I had to teach him my needs, but he never made me feel bad. By the way, he lives in Massachusetts and I live in Texas. He FaceTimed me for every meal and told me I was beautiful and perfect every single time I started worrying about my weight.Over the summer I got a job in Massachusetts and lived with him in a tiny room in a house he shared with 4 guys. It was hard at first and there was even a time I almost gave up because he didn't understand I needed to eat at the same time everyday because otherwise I wouldn't eat at all. We talked it out and developed a plan. It ended up working out and I got used to living with the perfect, most loving, caring person.Summer ended and I had to go back to Texas for my last semester of college. I'm doing well in my classes because I don't skip and I always get my work done, but I'm struggling with eating again. For some reason almost all food looks gross to me. I don't think I'm eating nearly as much as I should be even though I'm really trying. I was really happy with my weight, but now I'm almost back to my high school weigh. I've never really struggled with anorexia before, but that seems to be my new problem. I'm not sure if it's because I'm sad from missing my boyfriend or scared of food because of my past relationship with it, but something's definitely wrong. I used to always be hungry and now I never am. Yesterday I felt sick while sitting at my computer, so I stood up and my vision went black at the edges. I crumpled to the floor and dropped everything in my hands and waited on the floor in the fetus position for the feeling to go away. I ended up taking a nap and ordering food for dinner and then sleeping very early. I feel alright now, but a little shaken. I think I'll feel better if I get back into a routine of eating at the same times everyday, but I've never been a very good cook and usually just ate microwavable meals. The problem is that type of food just looks gross to me now. I was hoping some of you might have some simple, fresh meal ideas for a recovering bulimic/possible anorexic that I could make easily.

14,djinniboo,10-07-21,I really need help..,"Hey guys...
I am a 47 year old anorexic woman. I had anorexia in my teens, which I had to be hospitalized for. I am normal height and I got down to a very low weight. At age 17, I got help and started recovery. I was under the assumption that I had fully recovered because I was able to eat intuitively throughout most of my adult life. But there were a few periods where I fell back into anorexic behavior, so my trajectory should not be too surprising.
2 years ago I got out of an abusive marriage. Like many people who suffer from eating disorders, I have experienced trauma. My parents were alcoholics, I was sexually and verbally abused and I have endured 3 divorces, not to mention the 6 divorces my mother went through while I was growing up. Stability was in limited supply and, put mildly, I have been through hell.
So, after the domestic violence incident in 2019, I spiraled back down into anorexia. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to find my way back out of it. I have a daughter, so I worry what influence this might have on her. I am currently receiving counseling but can't seem to stop. I count calories obsessively, overexercise, cut up my food, consume caffeine all day... you guys know how it goes. But I am angry at myself because, while I know that what I am doing is harmful and desperately want to stop...I just can't seem to.
I need help. This is impacting my ability to function. The only part of my life that seems to be thriving is my family life (for which I am grateful), but I wonder what affect this is having on them?
Incidentally, I am a very thin (but not dangerously underweight) woman, so no one outside of my family or therapist would suspect I struggle with this. Truth be told, I am of two minds. On an emotional level, being thin is satisfying. Note the word FEEL. It makes me FEEL attractive and FEEL like my life is in control. However, I KNOW (logically) that the feelings of control are an illusion, I KNOW that I am probably more attractive when my skin has color and I'm healthy and I KNOW that this is destroying me from the inside out. So, if I know this, why can't I stop?! This obsessive cycle comes at the cost of hurting my family, not to mention MYSELF. I always feel cold, I've lost so much hair, I am unable to sleep or concentrate and I'm destroying my body from the inside out. No one should feel happy when they see their ribs and chest bones! This is really difficult. I want to have my life back. I miss eating food and feeling FREE and happy.",Annet,"Fri,10/08/2021-9:21pm","Hi djinniboo,","Welcome to the forums and congratulations on so many years that were anorexia-free.
Once, I heard a therapist saying that full recovery from eating disorders is possible. Like we all can recover from a cold or a broken leg. However, we can experience a cold or break another leg later in our life.Anorexia seems to be back to your life but it may be just a lapse. You already overcame it once and I am sure you will overcome it again. You are getting treatment, you are fed up of the illness, what is that you are still afraid of doing in order to get your life back?If you are fearful of eating or not working out, do it now. The more you challenge your ED, the sooner you will be able to get rid of it. I know it is not easy. I perfectly get it. I am 41 and have had all types of eating disorders. I have been fine sometimes and I have relapsed others. But each relapse has come with a lot of learnings. I know that the older I get, my body can tolerate less the side effects of my ED. I know that an ED can steal the joy of my life. I know that an ED can make me so depressed to feel like wanting to die.So, start challening your ED, NOW. Don't leave it for tomorrow. We have it always in our back pocket. We use it when life gets hard. But our experience has shown us that it is not the way out.I send you a big hug. Keep fighting!Annet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

16,2Healthy4me,07-10-21,My OB-GYN exam left me in a Bad Space yesterday..............,"Firstly, I went to see my OB-GYN yesterday. We discussed my fibroids. Good news is that they are smaller then when evaluated a few yrs ago. Then , of course, like every OB-GYN exam, which is always so intimidating to me. I Never have adjusted to this invasive type of annual exam.Good news is the Dr said that everything LOOKS OK but if begin having a severe period or painful abdominal that I must race to the ER where they may do a spring cleaning of my old lady parts and then that shall be the end of that problem once and 4 ALL.....The bad news is that I have gained a lot of weight since she saw me last. I felt Very Ashamed sitting naively and having this bad news thrust upon my ears and then my stomach began to tighten and I thought that I would race out to the nearest bathroom and purge. Secondly, it felt like my restricting ED was triggered all over again from the bearer of this scary, truthful news about my issue of having become overweight in the last few yrs since she had seen me last.I last saw her when I was at the ER for severe pain in my stomach. My med chart states that I actually had a diverticulitis flare up and was internally toxic. I felt so bad, the EMT had to remove my IV so I could run and throw up in the nearest bathroom. This rude woman blocked my entrance to the toilet and held a plastic bag for me to throw up into. I couldn't speak OBVIOUSLY-duh, so I had to go around her rude road block. It actually felt like such a relief to rid myself of these acute toxins from my belly. That day was the 1st time the OB-GYN came in to discuss my other problem currently haunting my womanly organs. Well, I am just a little more aware of my weight as I have now heard the real news that I have gained a new pet donkey, and lost my feeling of self control and this feels scary to me. Lastly, I am actually feeling more goal oriented to be careful of what I place into my mouth  and I'm sure I will be relapsing into a full fledged case of restricting behavior. I'm sure I will feel much better when the local pools re-open, and when I find a gym to tone and sculpt my muscles which were in great form just a year and a half ago.Oh well for now. The bitter Truth is Not sweet 4 me. The truth about my Covid weight gain feels like a fulcrum in my attempt to get healthy. Once I get the Go Ahead from the recreational facilities in my local area, I will be exercising once again.I hope that you all are working on your plans for achieving a healthier YOU and keep up the great work....",Annet,"Sat,07/10/2021-6:20pm","Hi 2Healthy4me,","I am sorry to hear about your health problems. However, it is good that the doctor found you well.
I do hate going to any type of doctor but the ob-gyn is the one I fear the most.
Please do not get frustrated due to your current weight. Life is too short to live by being slaves of what we eat or how much we work out. The best here is to live your life, create your own memories and to send our ED to the back seat. Whatever weight you may have that is more than your ""healthy weight"" will eventually go once you resume your normal activities. Please avoid going into restriction because we all know, we do not get anything good from it.Hugs

My doctor has stated that at this point in my illness, it would be best for me to seek inpatient treatment. However, I am self employed (I teach piano) and if I take 3-4 weeks, I don't get paid. On top of that, my husband makes very little. We can only just afford bills as it is. I'm exploring intensive outpatient as an option as well, but even that would interrupt my schedule for teaching. No matter what way we go, it's looking to be difficult for us to afford the level of care I need. I'm overwhelmed and depressed and don't know what to do.

19,littlelemontree,09/23/2021,Doubting diagnosis in extreme hunger,"Hi everyone! First of all, this is my first post, so I'm not really sure how to put this. I was diagnosed with anorexia this year, and have suffered similar episodes in the past. This relapse was by far the worst, and I am now trying to recover. As soon as I started to increase my meal plan with my dietitians recommendations, I started experiencing extreme hunger. I try to honor the hunger and eat more, but when I do this, a voice in my head tells me that because I am ""giving in"" to extreme hunger, I can't really have an ED, and that the diagnosis must be false. I am not sure if this makes sense... Does anyone else feel this way? Of course, I KNOW that starting recovery doesn't mean I was never sick, but I feel like I'm ""giving in"" to this hunger too easily. I'm just looking for support or anyone else who has experienced similar feelings...",kcporter6,"Fri,09/24/2021-8:42pm",Littlelemontree,"I was there about 9 months ago. I was forced into recovery in a way, but there was no one holding me accountable. Despite that I ate a lot of food during extreme hunger with little compensation, so I gained all the weight back and then some. I felt like and still do sometimes, “maybe I wasn’t really anorexic, I was just exaggerating” because I wasn’t thin enough, I binged and purged during my anorexia instead of restriction and exercise. And I had people tell me I was definitely dealing with an eating disorder, but I never got a professional diagnosis, so I continued to doubt myself. Af the end of the day, I know you have heard it 1000 times before, the severity has nothing to do with anything physical, if it causes you stress or pain or whatever, it deserves to be healed. I spent months trying to go back to the original behaviors, but I never could maintain it, and I hated myself because if it was so effortless to eat again, then I never was sick. Over time, this feeling has faded for me, mostly because it’s just useless to keep ruminating and it stresses me out. The best things I can recommend is literally just validating yourself. I would’ve thought that is SO STUPID, but you hear something enough like “you are sick enough and you deserve help” you eventually start to listen. Now, 8 months later, I’m starting to return to a normal life with regular eating and normal people things like college and jobs. So I guess it does get better :)",littlelemontree,"Sat,09/25/2021-9:43am",Thank you for your,Thank you for your wonderfully kind response :) it makes me feel a lot better knowing that someone else has gone through something similar and that it does get better...

20,WorkingErlking,08/15/2021,Before Dinner Time ,"Hi,
I'm currently trying to recover from my eating disorder.
One thing that has really been upsetting me lately is before dinner. Just like what happened today. I was cooking with my mom, and I just felt so stressed, pressured, and overwhelmed as we made all the food. There was so much everywhere. I wasn't dizzy, but it was like everything was whirling around me and I ended up breaking down because it was all too much. Not all days are like this, but it seems to be a trend.
This is why I am wondering if anyone has ideas on how to make this part less stressful. What do you do when making the food is difficult? Do you just push through it like a semi truck or distract yourself by watching Mr.Bean? I don't know but please share any ideas.
Thank you.",_julie_,"Thu,09/23/2021-3:20pm",Cooking can be stressful ,"Cooking can be stressful and I also feel overwhelmed depending on what I make. I found that if I try to prep as much before cooking, like pre measuring ingredients, or if I make a side or appetizer to go with the meal, I'll make it before I even start cooking. I find that it makes cooking easier and more enjoyable and doesn't feel as stressful or frustrating. Also when I feel like when I'm cooking and it's getting away from me, I ask my mom to help out, so maybe you could let your mom take control and see what you can do to help her out so it's not as overwhelming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have never felt this way before.I eat regularly, within moderation, and exercise 4 x a week or so. Everything I do is in Moderation. After I took a tumble down my apt stairs about 8 months ago, my body has had achy thighs, pelvic bones, and now swelling in my ankle area. I did freak out and have been taking OTC water pills to help w/ this foot problem.I cant even wear normal footwear to my retail job currently from this swollen foot.I only eat X meals a day and X snacks as well.Nothing is snacked on that would even cause me to gain weight, sometimes 1 Lb. a day.I have donated all my gently used jeans, and other dresses, some which I was planning to wear when I fit into them as they were just a tad tight on me.I had to order new dresses, exercise pants, tops for work, etc.I am frustrated over these changes in my body weight and size.

Often, I feel like you.  I often ask myself: ""Why if I am doing all the right things, I am feeling worse?I do not have an answer. What I think is happening is that even though we are finding a balance in our lives (food/exercise-wise), we are unable to avoid our body complaining for so many years living an ED-life.Also, we are not 15, anymore. Besides all the damage we have done to our muscles and joints, for sure some other aches come from aging and recent injuries.In your particular case, I think your weight increase comes from your water retention problem. Please talk to a doctor and also tell him about your body aches. Sometimes, water retention causes everything to hurt. Also, you fell down from the stairs. Please ensure everything is okay.The other day, one of my Uni counsellors replied back to an email I sent him (he is retired, already). He said: ""The more that I age, the more that I learn just to observe and feel"".I am hyperactive, I suffer a lot when I can not practice my favorite exercise. But at the same time, I think of what may happen when I am old or disabled... Maybe, I will learn to observe and feel...It is just another way of living life (besides doing/moving our body).Hugs

26,kcporter6,08/20/2021,dreading life without an ED,"Simple version: I want to want to recover. But I also want to stay sick. I've seen people say ""I don't want to shrink myself"" or ""I want to live my life"" and I want to feel like that but I don't. Did something change for them? or are they just faking it to make it?Long version: I have no idea how to WANT to recover. My family has pushed/forced me in the past, but ultimately I ignore them. People have told me that I have an eating disorder, but I stay seeking validation, looking for ""sick enough"". I don't want to burden the people around me with the bullshit that comes along with EDs, but I'd still rather be dying than recovering. I want to want to be better. I don't know how to recover with so little motivation or self-esteem (but not none). I don't have hopes or dreams to come back to, I don't want to face life without my eating disorder. Currently I'm using excuses. I'm not severely restricting like I was, it's not that bad, it's under control, it's just dieting, etc etc etc etc etc. I keep saying I am just fine with living with an eating disorder for the rest of my life, that nobody will be able to help because I don't even want to help myself. But a teeny, tiny part of me knows that long-term EDs are not ideal. They are the opposite of ideal. I don't want to be sick but it's the easiest thing I know. Additionally, a little bit unrelated, I was diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder a little while ago, and knowing it commonly co-occurs with eating disorders, I wanted to start a discussion. I feel like if I give up an eating disorder, I'll have to adopt a new self-destructive habit like alcohol abuse. It's like I don't know how to cope with my own life. If anyone has any advice or comments, I would so appreciate it!! Anything to feel a little less lost.",Annet,"Sat,08/21/2021-12:08am","Hi kcporter6,","ED's always come with a lot of ambiguity. I think it is normal to have periods of time when we are motivated to recover and some others when we are not. I still believe that I can be recovered and still keep my anorexic figure. I know that is not possible but I like to think it could be real.Long time ago, I felt like you. At some point, I stopped all treatment and said: ""If I can not stop my ED, I will stop fighting with it"" and decided to keep an eating-disordered life.To my surprise, reducing the focus on my ED helped me to be more flexible and natural with regards to my eating, exercise and body perception.I was cronically ill but I was functional... UNTIL I got tired of being pseudo-recovered and gave full recovery another try.That is where I am. I know sometimes it is not our moment to recover. Sometimes, we need to fake it until we make it. But there is a point in our lives when we realize the damage we are doing to our body and to our own life. Then, the desire to change comes.The only thing I will say is that ED's limit our lives. They make us live in a little box. We miss a lot of experiences and social interactions.If we want to live life fully, we can choose to be fine (or at least, the best that we can).Cheers

I just wanted to add my two cents in here. I’ve been in your shoes and it sucks. I pseudo-recovered and now I’m back in ED hell. What I’ve been told before is that it doesn’t matter if you WANT to recover, just that you’re WILLING to take the steps necessary to start the recovery process. Im not sure you will ever hear someone with anorexia who says they want to gain weight and recover, but it’s important that they are willing to take that next step. Also, you made a comment that it isn’t that bad, that you’re not that sick. Again, this is a comment theme around eating disorders. We never feel as though we are sick enough to warrant treatment, that we could still handle losing a few more pounds, that our labs were mostly normal and we’re not in the ICU too sick to move, so that somehow gives our sick brains the green light to continue the self harm that comes along with an eating disorder. When someone brought it to my attention that I was engaging in self harm, it opened my eyes a lot. I don’t cut myself or anything like that, but I am doing damage to my body by depriving it of essential nutrients by restricting and/or purging. I too sometimes feel as though I am too lazy to continue in eating disordered behaviors, but also not motivated enough to recover. It’s difficult to find the energy to do anything when you are not fueling your body with what it needs. I don’t have the answers, but I do know that if you wait until you WANT recovery, it could be too late. Open up with your therapist about how you feel and your fears surrounding recovery. Tell them you are scared you might take up drinking or drugs to fill the void of the ED and they should be able to help you come up with some other coping skills to fill that void. Good luck! You can do this!",MSR2021,"Fri,09/03/2021-6:26pm",Motivation isn't Everything,"This is where I compare ED to depression. If someone is too depressed to get help, it's because depression saps your motivation. ED works in a similar way. It's hard to be motivated to do something when you are lacking the energy to stay motivated! Just remember that motivation isn't everything. I don't like to clean my apartment. Sometimes I do, but most of the time I don't. And sometimes it reaches a point where I have to bust out the feather duster and vaccuum because you can't take it anymore! Other times, I have to badger myself. The end result is the same.
I think EDs are kind of like that. Don't punish yourself for not ""wanting"" to get better. You being on this forum proves that you do. Otherwise, you wouldn't reach out. You didn't want to, but you did it anyway.",EphWhyEye,"Mon,09/06/2021-11:12pm",Oh why,"Oh why can't I be addicted to something not destructive?!

Bottom line is I'm constantly trying to find an escape from me, my depression and anxiety and inability to live instead of just exist. All I can say with certainty is recovery 15 years ago would have been a lot easier to start and commit to than it is now. The health repercussions have caught up to me. I am 'sick enough'.

28,struggling_mom,08-02-21,struggling w/ no family/support system,"Hello,
I truly appreciate the opportunity to be heard. I have had an eating disorder since age 14. I am now 27 with two young children. I was very very sick before I got pregnant with my first child. I had tried multiple eating disorder centers. even flying myself to other states because i didn't trust myself to stay. I'm a chronic bad patient, checking in and out depending on my emotions. It's so hard getting help as an adult, because when the eating disorder voice saying ""I don't want to be here"" kicks in, there's nothing to stop you from leaving treatment. I feel that most people have family support throughout their treatment. But I had no one pushing me to stay or get help. My fiance at the time watched my health decline and it got to the point where I knew no one was going to save me. I found a lovely counselor who specializes in eating disorders, I was able to get healthy. And almost immediately got pregnant once at a healthy weight.This is where I felt my eating disorder was ""cured""
when I was pregnant, I knew the babies health was too important to restrict. I finally had a good appetite, my pregnancy brain was protecting me from depression. I was looking forward to this new life.
Of course this was very naive. Now with my second child almost 2 years old. I'm falling back into old habits. using restricting as a coping skill to deal with the depression from lack of family support. my families Lack of concern about my health (mentally and physically). self destructing slowly and quietly. I was brought up in a family where you keep your problems quiet.
It makes me sad that this has happened before, and I still feel shame in asking for help. How could I be so selfish? why haven't I ""grown up"" yet?
I have panic attacks, extreme anxiety to the point I can't work. I've been denied disability, and I feel like caring for my children just isn't enough.
I'm currently in college, but still don't feel like i'm doing enough. What breaks my heart is my fear of losing control again. becoming so sick that I can't care for my children properly. I care about them more than I care about myself, which is probably part of the problem. my self worth has always been low. How do you get into recovery with noone supporting you? not even your significant other?
is it reasonable to expect him to help me when we're both dealing with working and caring for kids?
This was why I never succeeded in typical recovery centers. I don't want help from a rotating shift of strangers. I want people who actually care. but they just don't exist. its so depressing.how would I fit recovery into my busy mom schedule?
I'm afraid of the future after recovery, how am I going to wake up, get me and my kids ready and out the door, work an 8 hour shift, come home, cook dinner, get them ready for bed etc?
I've been in therapy for years but still feel I have no good coping skills. Nothing works for me.It all seems like too much. I love my children, but I feel like a horrible mother for having this problem.
I'm extremely resentful toward my family for making me feel like I need to suck it up and never complain.
I don't have the energy to do the things I want to do. I don't feel loved. I don't feel worthy of anything. I don't enjoy hobbies. My fear and obsession with food is consuming my life again. Id love to just have someone to talk to about this stuff, without judging or assuming I want attention (which is another fear i have about talking about it)Does anyone else feel like this? Am I the only adult who still feels like a child inside my body? forced to go through the motions but knowing everything might come crashing down at any moment.To whoever is reading this,
Thank you for thinking of me.
Kandace",ilostmyself.98,"Sun,08/15/2021-12:04pm","hey,","hey,
Many people will just say something along the lines, everything will be alright so I won't say that. what I can say is I can relate to you 200%. My family isn't the nicest they are very judgmental and gossip. Naturally I won't vent to them but lately I've been venting to my mom. I told her the real way I lost weight (not eating unfortunately), how long I've been like this for, and my concern. she then told me that she used to be anorexic and bulimic (found this out today). But again why didnt she tell me sooner instead of waiting for me to vent? These questions as much as they are good to ask we dont necessarily need the answer to them. my family as well lacks the concern for my health none of them come to see if im ok or how im doing. I have many siblings and none of them except a brother that I connected with from my fathers side who has been through worse than me. But the ones I actually grew up with my sisters dont ask me how im doing or if I wanna go out and just take a moment to vent about life. my mom doesn't do this either we talk text. so I definitely can relate to you, you are not alone.just like your husband my man doesn't push me to get help. I push him to get the help he needs and to take days off to rest as needed but why won't he return the favor or not technically a favor but why can't he care for me in the way we care for them? (another one of those annoying useless questions that just drag us down.) Ive been noticing my bones and joints hurting. I tell him my thoughts and then only thing I get is either im fine and healthy just like my doctor said or I should make an Appointment. boom end of conversation.I totally get the just everything you said I can't even pin point it anymore cause im also a college student with depression and severe anxiety that cause me to have panic attacks. I also feel like caring for my daughter isn't enough I feel like im just doing the bare minimum. I know how you feel about wanting someone who just cares so I care. I care about your health and your concerns as if they were my own. we can do this for ourselves and for our children I believe in us.",Annet,"Sun,08/15/2021-6:45pm","Hi ladies,","No one in my family really knows the struggles I go through with my Ed. In the past, they supported me but some of them never got it OR they just became like the ""food police"" to me.As an adult now, I have decided to battle this on my own.

They have many other worries to think of (a sister with terrible OCD issues, a depressed mum, terrible fights at home, etc.).

29,riverpink,08/19/2021,My Boyfriend is so frustrated with me and my ED. ,"I started battling an ED in November 2020, it went away on its own. But, it came back with so much more force in April this year. Throughout this period, I've gotten help, and im still receiving this help. But my boyfriend, I just don't think he knows what to say or do. Some days, he's completely understanding that my mood changes a lot, especially after the discussion of food or eating, and he comforts me and supports me. But some days, like today, he gets so frustrated with me. I am slowly, very slowly, recovering, but I am still nowhere near where I *should* be. Today, I ate more than I normally would. and didn't want to eat anything for dinner, as I felt full. When I mentioned he should eat, he reacted negatively. He told me to stop talking, and I didn't know what to do after this. I sat on the bed and waited for him to apologise, or come sit with me. But he didn't. I left the room to let him sleep for his early shift, and he followed me out and ranted at me. Saying that I promise him things, and don't act on them. I explained that my feelings throughout the day change, and I can never promise to stick to something. He said that if I wanted someone who would let me just ""not eat"" then I should break up with him, even after I explained that I had eaten more today than I had in weeks, and this was an achievement. I just want him to see that getting angry and frustrated with me, makes me feel worse, when my head is already a mess and pushes negative thoughts onto me. I want him to read more into how he can talk and help me, but I don't want to ask him to. I stood on the stairs crying and telling him that its not that easy, and recovery doesn't come in a day. he says he understands but I don't think he does. He says ""do I have to not eat to get you to eat?"" because I always encourage him to eat. This made me feel awful, like its my fault if he doesn't eat, when im feeling down.

I don't know how to help you. Are you going to order something? I hate when you just sit there not eating."" Etc. But other days I get support ""you'll eat when you can. Do you need anything from the store? Try a bite, it's just a bite. I saved you some for when you want it."" Etc. Your boyfriend gets angry and frustrated because he cares and feels he can't help. Understand he is his own person and don't try to micromanage when or what he does or does not eat. They don't like that and it kind of makes us hypocritical. Even with all the knowledge in the world, he will never be you and completely understand.

30,MSR2021,09-03-21,Otherwise Unspecified,"Hi, I was wondering if other people have an ED that doesn't fit into current diagnoses that well, or presents in a way different? I struggled in a PHP group because there was so much focus on a specific way EDs often manifest that I don't experience, it made me feel kind of alienated from my own treatment, or like i should be thankful that it's not ""worse"". But it's a struggle, especially when i can't seem to get treatment to ""fit"" me. I find ""otherwise unspecified"" to be really difficult to navigate. It's like, people tell you that you have aspects for for other ED diagnoses, but also that you're different enough not to fit into either. They also say that labels don't matter. But, I dunno, I find it helpful to use words to describe an experience. Saying that blue is a color so it doesn't matter what type feels like it's just ignoring helpful experiences. Or like, you can't acknowledge that blue is different than green?Sorry if the analogy is confusingHow do some of you navigate an ED that doesn't look like how most treatment thinks of ED?

So, they sent me to attend some OCD related sessions.I did not have a lot in common with those patients BUT something that we all struggled with was with an obsession and a compulsion. Most of us struggled with anxiety and depression or simply with not finding the way out.So, those are some things you can somehow relate with... and with human suffering, in general.I would suggest you to have your individual therapy sessions and if groups/treatment are being difficult to you because you do not feel you fit in, talk to your team.Maybe they can help you find some other groups where you feel better.I send you a warm hug and I want you to know that you are NOT alone. Eating disorders can come in many ways and forms. We are all different and our ED's are, too.So, keep fighting yours and in the sessions you attend, check if any of the other people's strategies may help you. Or simply ask them for ideas to fight your own daemons...Cheers

At first, it feels like ""paradise"" but as the years go by, your body starts experiencing the consequences.I had bulimia for many years but it came to a point where my body could not tolerate my behaviors any longer. As of now, I barely vomit. That is ""out of my vocabulary"" BUT if I ever do it, I feel very very bad (physically). I perfectly understand your bladder's lack of control. If I vomit, that also happens to me. It is due to the big effort you are putting on your muscles... your chest, your stomach, your back, your bladder, everything.Please get some treatment if you are not receiving any. ED's are a deadly disease and vomiting is something that completely depletes your body from all minerals and nutrients. For example: your chest pain can not only be caused due to the effort of vomiting but also, due to an electrolyte imbalance. That can cause heart attacks...My experience... the first days that you keep the food down, it is really hard. However, the longer you do it, the easier it becomes. Please start leaving that food in your body. Food is energy. It is not a bad thing...AND You DESERVE to LIVE!Hugs

35,seekingchange,08/31/2021,I don't know who to tell,"I was 8 when my sister was diagnosed with anorexia. My family life became a living hell and it genuinely ruined our lives for years and my family is still broken from the effects the illness had on my sister. She's now 23 (was diagnosed at 12) and is still suffering. I'm now in college and am pretty positive that I have anorexia. My sister was extremely skinny and I am not underweight so my family doesn't worry about my health. I don't want to tell my family because I am ashamed that after these years of my sister's suffering that now I've developed one too. And I don't want to tell my college friends because I don't want them to police my eating. But I worry about myself. I don't eat at all like I used to. I am scared of so much food and I try and eat as little as possible every day. But I came back to college after the summer having lost a lot of weight and I got so many compliments :(. Everyone is telling me I look so skinny and that my abs look so good and that I look so hot in my bikini. I don't know how I'm ever gonna be okay gaining weight. I just don't know who could possibly help me. I don't think I could ever tell my parents, who are still taking care of my sister, that I now need help too. And I don't want my college friends, who already are a bit concerned about me, because they personally are not okay with being around disordered eating as girls who have struggled with food themselves. When one of our friends started eating less and less, they expressed that it was hard for them to be around, and we aren't friends with her anymore, whether that's the reason I am not sure. I just feel trapped. There's really no one I can tell, and I love the way my body looks.

My exspouse had the disease our entire marriage and  2 of my daughters have dealt with it or are currently dealing with it.  There are a few things that I have picked up on regarding your post. First, you are afraid you have an eating disorder and your friends are telling you how skinny you are yet you don't think you are underweight. This has to do with acceptance, peer pressure and judgement.  Having to worry about what you eat while worrying about how others perceive you means you are heading down a dangerous path.  Second, you mention that your sister has had an ED for many years.  You are torn between the attention your sister received as attention that you did not get and the fact that it was negative attention that was harmful to the family.  Don't worry, as hard as it may have been for your parents, they love you just as much as your sister and will still love you the same even if you decide to tell them regarding your ED.  Eating disorders are very difficult for everyone including family and friends'  The most important thing is finding help.  I am sure your parents love you and want to help.  They cannot help if they don't know.  I am not sure if you are religious, but trusting in God can be a huge help in recovery.  Jesus loves you unconditionally and accepts you for who you are.

36,H.Maria,08/31/2021,Am I just being dramatic,"Hi!First of all I would just like to apologise for my English, you see I'm from Finland.That being said I will get to the point, even though I don't really know what my point is exactly.I have a lovely family that is unfortunately very focused on looks. My two older sisters have had and currently have problems with food and body-image. And the negative, self hating talk is the talk I have grown up with.I didn't think much of it when I was about 13-years-old (I'm 18 now) and I hated my thighs. I couldn't think about anything else. I remember wearing two pairs of leggings and jeans over them when it was a hot summer day. I just wanted to look skinny.Then I started boxing and running and going to the gym. I started loving exercise and I liked how I didn't look ""skinny fat"" anymore.But now as of lately it has come to the point where I can't cope if I can't exercise like I wanted to. Even though I more often than not feel like I just want to rest. Other people do don't they?Food was fuel before. You can't be an athlete if you don't eat. But eating has become a fear of mine. I still eat and currently I'm eating somewhat okay. But every time I don't eat when I'm supposed to I'm proud of myself. Every time I feel weak because I'm hungry I feel proud of myself.I compete with people that don't know I'm competing with them. If they eat little, I eat less. If they exercise, I will do twice as much. Because If I don't do that I feel like I have let myself go and I will gain weight. And what more is there to me than looking fit? That is my thought process. And the hardest thing is that I don't know if I want to change it. Well I know I do because I don't like living like this, but I am scared of losing control if I don't get to think like this.I don't know if I said anything even though I said a lot. It is just hard to put into words.
But the question that is constantly on my mind is am I just being dramatic?",Annet,"Wed,09/01/2021-11:18pm","Hi H. Maria,","I do not think you are being dramatic. Comparison is the thief of joy and we, as people with eating disorders, compare what we eat, our body and our exercise to everyone around.

I used to check her workouts to do more and you know what? That life style became like a prison....modern slaveryI know that if you are mentioning this is because this is something that bothers you.

38,silverstars,08/29/2021,Out of treatment & struggling...,"I was in inpatient treatment for almost 6 weeks and got home just over a month ago.
I did really well there.I gained the weight.I didn't struggle there with my meals or snacks at all.I was really motivated and felt so strong.I did a lot of hard work in CBT and DBT.When I got home I set up an appointment with a private dietician (whom i can't really afford,nor can i afford her prescribed meal plan).I was supposed to have had an appointment with her on the 4th of September but have already abandoned that idea.I haven't been eating at all the way I learned to in treatment.They told me to keep weighing myself,that it would be important for my pyschiatrist and dietcian (Both of whom I only can have appointments over the phone with due to covid so can't be weighed in their offices.) to know my weight and important for ME to know my weight-
So I have been weighing myself twice a week on the same days as i was being weighed in treatment.To be honest,I haven't been at all triggered by the number,but I am triggered by the changes in my body.I haven't really been eating meals,just snacking or bineging.Part of the reason for this is ever since I got home my GAD and OCD have been overwhelming me,and anxiety tends to steal my appetite.Yesterday i had a very bad anxiety attack and really had to force myself to eat just a very little bit.This morning I have kept telling myself I need to eat breakfast but I haven't.And I found myself looking at the calories on an item without really meaning to.It also occurred to me to weigh myself,when I am not supposed to weigh myself until tomorrow.All in all getting into dangerous territory.Already.I am so ashamed of myself.I was just in the ER the other day with a very bad anxiety attack and suicidal ideation and my OCD was so intense but they would not help me.I also had called a crisis line that morning but the guy wasn't helpful at all either really.These experiences have made me hesitate to seek out help in the future.In the ER the pysch resident asked me how I was doing with my anorexia,and I told her I wasn't actively trying to lose weight-I'm not-(At least not yet) but that I have a voice in my head sometimes that tells me i am not allowed to eat.(Not an auditory hallucination,but,you know,that eating disorder ""voice."")I know I should be eating even when I don't feel hungry-I don't want to continue with the dietcian or her meal plan.It was both a very overwhelming and expensive meal plan.My GP arranged for me to have free supplements but I haven't even been drinking those.My weight has been going up and down over the past few weeks.I don't understand.i did so well in treatment.I came home on a ""high"" as my pyschiatrist said.Now I have fallen so far even though i am still,at least not conciously,trying to lose weight.In treatment i was told not to let more than four hours go by without eating.Well I quite frequently find I have done just that.At first this was truly anxiety driven but now i fear it has become a way of coping again.And a focus for my OCD apart from my other disturbing obsessions.I don't know what I am looking for here exactly.I really just needed to get this out somewhere.My pyschiatrist is also my therapist and i have been being honest with him about this but as of this week he doesn't know how bad it has gotten.Anyway...I am sorry,this has been way too long a post.Thank you for reading if you have.Oh I have so much shame over this...",faith2joy,"Wed,09/01/2021-12:39pm",Silverstars,"There is no shame in reaching out for help.

I suffer from anorexia, bulimia, and ironically on top of that, binge eating. I've been struggling with these things since 2016, but I relapsed, hard, over the summer. I was lucky enough to get a nutritionist and I had a good three weeks of bliss. I was eating enough, I wasn't fasting, and I was finally able to get back to the gym, fitness being a life-long passion for me. However, the stress of moving out and actually being in college seemed to be too much. I binged hardcore before coming, and I've binged hardcore since. I keep having thoughts telling me to fast for days at a time and have to actively have my mom call me to make sure I eat on the days I'm not binging. I find myself at my university's gym working for hours and hours trying to get any calories off. It's already causing me difficulty in my classes, I feel totally overwhelmed and like I'm drowning. I can't stop bodychecking and comparing myself to others. I have no idea how to bring myself out of this cycle. Is there anyone else who relapsed going to college? How did you get yourself out of it?

I feel like even though binge eating is a more common issue, people don't care unless you're anorexic. Personally, the binge eating makes me feel sooooo invalid, as much as I felt in the worst part of my restriction. College-wise, I feel like if I stay busy with homework or something in a library all day and schedule my meals, then I am a little distracted from food.

I found a great person to work with at that period of my life and was able to finish school and handle my life at the moment. That person helped me overcome anorexia. Unfortunately, then, my ED mutated and I fell down into bulimia.You are not alone and what you are experiencing is pretty common for people going to college.Talk it out and honestly, stop the long work out hours.

I hope you are doing okay.
I was reading your post and wanted to say that I think I understand how you feel. For a lot of people (me too), I've heard  that it is completely nerve wracking and terrifying to talk to others about this. At one point in my life I also thought no one cared and I didn't want to tell anyone about my behaviours either. But telling my mom and then my sister was probably one of the best choices I've ever made.
Sometimes my mom will get mad at me for the ed behaviours, but she always moves back into a place of love and support. I've realised that when she gets mad at me at first it is because she loves me and is genuinely afraid for my health and wellness. So sometimes, I think it helps to try to accept others' feelings about the behaviour, because I become mad at it too sometimes.
And I know that not everyone has a supportive family system, but for me family has been important so I am very thankful. But even if they weren't supportive, if I never let my family know then I wouldn't know if I could count on them for support or if I needed to look somewhere else. So I'm a strong believer in trying to find support when appropriate because getting better is so, so difficult to do alone.
And even though there have been scary or difficult moments, I just know that telling the people I'm close to about this seems to make us even closer and my eating  disorder thrives in secrecy, so it is very important for me that others know. In the past when I kept it a secret and didn't want to talk about it with anyone, it spiralled out of control. And then I would try to get better on my own. This happened several times. It didn't work.
After telling just two people and talking with them regularly and joining support groups, I feel better and more hopeful than I have in quite awhile. I want to get better now.
So there is some food for thought if you would like to consider it. You certainly aren't alone and I hope you start to get better soon.",Aloneinthis,"Tue,08/17/2021-2:00pm",Midnight15,"Hi!

It’s now been years since I was considered anorexic, but the thoughts are coming back and so have the behaviors. I am back in therapy with a new therapist and I’m not sure how to feel about it. I want to lose weight and feel good about myself, but I don’t know how to lose weight without ED thoughts and behaviors. Maybe you could find a therapist you could talk to. I know it’s difficult for me to open up to friends and family because I feel ashamed that I’m dealing with issues surrounding food and something necessary for survival. It’s embarrassing for me to talk about an eating disorder with friends and family. I don’t want their pity and I don’t want their policing dinner tables and bathrooms and gyms.

I miss social interaction. I miss the gym and the swimming pool. I miss going out with my friends.Working from home or at something that is not your primary occupation may also make you feel you kind of frustrated. It is normal...

This was very upsetting to see how large my upper back and chest have become w/o specific gym muscle toning exercises. I use walking as my main exercise. This does nothing for my upper body and or the muscle tone above the waistline.I have been restricting my lunch for a while. I eat a simple breakfast and a meal for dinner. My body is just so hard to have control over. I'm older, but I don't want to look like my mom. She had leg trouble and could never walk due to her heel skin cracking and bleeding.  Her heels would crack and bleed if she walked,  even 3 blocks,  to our local grocery store, or to her  hair dresser lady.So I am older now and am feeling thigh pain, left side, and sometimes knees or feet begin hurting just as I am nearing the next lap on my 4 block exercise routine.I also need to begin drinking more water daily too.",Annet,"Sat,08/07/2021-9:28pm","Hi 2Healthy4me,","I think people with eating disorders struggle with aging due to the body changes that accompany it. In my personal case, I still would like my body to be able to run like 20 years back and of course, to look as fit as by then. I am not the most flexible person and less with any changes happening to my body. I also do not want to look like mum and we do not have to. The only thing we need to ensure of is to accomplish that goal by having a healthy life style. Walking and eating healthy is a good idea. Just do not obsess with it. I also feel pain in several parts of my body. After working out so much during my youth, I think I can not expect less.
That pain, sometimes prevents me from working out as much as I would like.Life is hard. We just need to be flexible and to do what is best for us at the present moment. I also recently gained an extra size in my bra...the reason being, I am putting on some weight plus I have been unable to work the upper part of my body due to a shoulder's injury.Did I like it? I am not sure. But I feel better with a healthier weight and life style.So, remember...a size and the scale do not define who we are.

Just like you, I understood I needed help. For about a year I talked with a therapist and did everything you're ""supposed"" to do but I felt helpless still. I couldn't let my anorexia go. The one thing that truly helped at first was having something to recover FOR. In my case that was college.

The road ahead is bumpy and scary and there are times where you want to give up completely. But one day, after months of recovery.. you'll realize that the eating disorder is quieter. The longer you go with recovery the more you realize that you're having fun eating out with friends and you're actually living life and that your eating disorder was lying to you the entire time. It does get better, but you have to find a reason to go through with it and you have to hold on through the scary parts along the way. You can do this.

I'm super new here. I've been eating disordered since 2016, but this summer has gotten really bad. I suffer from anorexia as well as a major binge/purge disorder, and my weight skyrockets from super lows to super highs in the span of weeks. I'm just now trying to get help as my health is on the decline. I have an appointment with professionals Monday, and I'm scared I might be hospitalized. Sorry for dumping all of this out there and if it's inappropriate, please feel free to correct me with anything if necessary.
I'm finally admitting I need help, but I really, really, really need some friends in recovery. I struggle maintaining friendships with some of my current friends suffering with eds as we all bounce in and out of recovery and tend to trigger ourselves. This is my first non-proana forum (those were the worst for me, I'm trying to undo the damage they gave me!) and I'd really like some people who get what eating disorders are like to talk to, but people that are in recovery so we don't trigger each other. I'm also really struggling with body dysmorphia right now so if anyone has any tips for that, please, please, please let me know.

50,yvist_,07/23/2021,Please help...started strength training and my eating is messed up again ,"My eating has been regulated for some weeks after a long confusing period. By regulated< I mean I get hungry cues at similar times every day and so I eat. But as I started my gym sessions, I got my constant food cravings back and I eat like having an insatiable appetite - which I had before. I heard that gaining muscles would lead to higher metabolism and easy hunger. But I only started working out for a week or two, there is no way my muscles grow so fast. Is it simply because my lifestyle changed so my cues got confused again? Please help. I am so stressed whenever I eat but not feeling full!!",sei_s,"Sat,07/24/2021-9:27am",Happened to me too,"Hi! What you're describing is so relatable. I used to go running regularly during recovery (for better or for worse) and my hunger would stay at a pretty consistent level, but on strength training days my appetite would seem to explode. Sometimes just a bit more than usual, sometimes to epic binge-inducing proportions.Overall, I think you still might be underestimating how much energy strength training actually requires. It's not just because of muscle gain; the ""afterburn"" effect is much greater than with cardio, and even if you don't see a big net increase in muscle, you're still having to repair all of the torn muscle fibers in your body.Additionally, strength training is a form of stress on your body, and EDs make our brains kind of panicky about any physical stress...in my experience at least, haha.I know that this can be super anxiety inducing, but I want you to know that you can actually trust your body and hunger and you'll be totally fine in the long term. There's nothing worse for you than restricting while strength training...you'll slowly destroy your muscles instead of building them. I made that mistake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I do not think you are relapsing but maybe you are having some slip.

It is in those moments when we need to eat no matter what.

55,Nishita ,07/17/2021,Lacking support,"am a seventeen year old girl from and Indian household. I am what I consider a pretty healthy weight but nevertheless, I am put on a diet recently along with vigorous exercise training. I love to eat food and I eat decently like under control but this diet doesn’t have a thing that I like and it’s very strict, my father made it himself. I want to get fitter and I am ready to work on it but I just hate the schedule, it’s like a third class weight loss plan. My father blackmails me saying that if I don’t follow it, he won’t take me to the gym. I love myself but they are so judgemental about everything that I eat and have always been. Even as a child below 10, I remember sneaking and keeping things in place so that I won’t be questioned even when I have never been overweight in my life. I have just stopped eating because of all this, I don’t want to eat anything like this, it’s better to eat nothing. I have a sweet tooth and I can’t eat sweets at all, I don’t have any problem with that but they should at least be considerate of my feelings and not eat them right in front of me while making tasty noises. Even before all this, whenever we got something that I liked, they said oh! Nishita doesn’t want to eat this which made all my appetite go down the drain. It’s okay to make fun but they did it every time which really hurt me and now because if the COVID situation here in India and all, I have been living with these monsters for 1.5 years. Even now where I don’t want to eat anything they first urge me to eat and then I deny so even if I grab something, they go you are not taking it to eat right, don’t eat anything. They are so heartless and emotionless. I don’t know how to help myself and I hate myself so much for that. #eatingdisorder",Annet,"Mon,07/19/2021-9:09pm","Hi Nishista,","I am sorry to hear about the situation in your home. I do have a toxic family and perfectly understand how difficult is to eat/not purge when all that they do is to make your life hard.
However, it is important you to understand that there is only ONE life and that in order to enjoy it, we need to be healthy.If you stop eating, you will eventually damage your body and for some of those damages, there is not a way back. As of now, you have to live in that house and with that people. But soon, you will be an adult and you will be able to live on your own.In my culture, we are supposed to live home until we get married. But I left before. First to pursue a master's degree and then, to live on my own.And even when you continue to live at home, the pandemic will eventually allow us to do more and more things. So, you will not have to spend all your time there.What I want to say is that you need to nourish yourself. Listen to your body and to your hunger cues. You better than anyone else know what is good for you. If someone is forcing you to follow a specific diet and that person is not a professional, then, don't do it. Ask that person to take you to a professional if she/he wants u to be on a diet.I send you a warm hug and PLEASE, do not restrict or fall down into the eating disorder's world. It is HELL and it can make you dependant on those around you (if u come to a point where u are unable to take care of yourself)Annet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

58,2Healthy4me,07-07-21,Having a Difficult Time after Covid Recess Weight Gain,"I am feeling totally frustrated over the weight gain and lack of toned muscles which I had a grip on b4 Covid haunted my comfort zone of Total Control by me losing my 2 very busy jobs, and no gym available during my down times of emotional duress or boredom leading to snacks and naps instead of my after dinner gym and pool workouts.I tried on clothes yesterday and the skirts and pants fit snugly. I canceled my interview today which was for a call center position. I have become physically undisciplined and now it's difficult for me to sleep at night or arise early in the morning. I take allergy pills to sleep at night and caffeine pills to arise mentally in the mornings. Only I feel tired even so after my caffeine pills have kicked in and am fearing that this is partly due to depression. I am trying to make myself go to the mall to pick up better fitting pants and skirts but I just feel to anxious to even cross the street to pick up a few groceries.  I need a hair trim and am too anxious to do this or even to get a badly needed pedicure.My awareness of how much I have gained weight and lost my fully controlled body muscle tone is just making me want to sleep all day. I walk at night and that workout is failing to help me to lose weight or regain muscle tone over my out of control body.I cant just ""Smile and be happy."" I have lost control over something I had the most control over. ""The Ding Dang Covid"",  Eliminated my 2 very busy jobs. They both enabled me to feel in control over my budget, my muscle tone, weight, and sense of security and weekly vocational routines. I feel lost like a ball of yarn rolling down the hill,  which is occupied now by Jack and Jill. I enjoy my space, and boundaries, and enjoy my time alone. I feel that my personal space is now too enmeshed by my new acquaintance. He and I spend almost every day together. I think this is leading me to relapse to my old habit of binging and rushing out to exercise. This time around I don't have the gym or the pool to give me a sense of a Total Control Workout. I have no reason not to be home to answer my phone,  or front door. I am really in a time of need for personal space, and Isolation. I am feeling crushed inwardly and can only take this pressure on for so long. My safety net is far away now and everyone expects me to have gotten over all my ancient stuff, but its coming all back and haunting me w/o an exit to run for safety or sense of closure and a little security for myself.",zenandrecovery,"Sun,07/18/2021-1:13am",You’re not alone,"I am in the same boat.
I’ve become aware of my weight gain since COVID. I was out looking at wedding dresses for my bestfriend and I couldn’t even be fully present because of all the mirrors… and pictures… I hadn’t realized it until I was surround by my own reflection and intense lighting. And I know the way I see myself is irrational, I know I’m my own worst critic. Especially about my body. So I tried to rationalize it by thinking I probably don’t look as bad as I think I do. Or that no one is paying that much attention to how I look. I can recognize those thoughts and try to rationalize them.
You are not alone in how you’re feeling. Because I feel the exact same. I wish I could put it into better words. I hope writing it out was helpful for you. I don’t know if you’re involved with therapy, but it can be helpful. Focusing on activities you enjoy can be helpful as long as they are not activities that have been or can be used to “purge” or be an unhealthy coping skill.
If you take away anything from this post, please remember that when you’re active in an eating disorder.. the disorder is what has the control, not you. It controls what you do, what you wear, how productive you are.. it’s takes more than it gives.

59,hozi3r,07/16/2021,trying to overcome bulimia,"i've contemplated a lot on whether or not i should join an online forum, but i figured it might help seeing other individuals go through the same or at least, similar situations that i am currently in. i've struggled with bulimia ever since the pandemic started. in prior to that, i was actually anorexic at the age of 13. i started to get better two years after, but when the pandemic hit, my ED shifted to bulimia. im currently 16. my birthday was a couple months ago in january. my parents found out at the time that i have been vomitting out food and they took me to a psychiatrist. she asked for a quick internal scan of my organs and i found out that my ED was already damaging my liver, kidney and heart. i was in treatment for about a month, and somewhere during mid-february, i had breakfast with my mom and then i fainted and was hospitalized because of malnutrition. i've been in recovery for about 4-5 months, but i'm back at home now. i was unable to do any of my school work and exams due to the extreme lack of energy. i got better for a few weeks and now i'm back in a cycle of eating and purging and i don't have the courage to tell my parents because i know they will condemn me for it. they believe that treatment is really expensive and i feel guilty asking for help from my own parents. they're not the best support system to begin with and i don't really have any friends who can relate to this. in all honesty, i'm not quite sure if anyone will be able to help or to respond- but i figured sharing my experience anonymously might help lift the burden of secretly still struggling with bulimia.",Depressedkid_1,"Sat,07/17/2021-8:53pm","Hozi3r,","I’m 16 as well. I struggle with anorexia. It’s a big step admitting that your struggling and asking for help. If your parents aren’t a good support try talking to friends. I know they may not understand but if their good friends they’ll try to help you as much as they can. I know my friends don’t get why I struggle with this but they try their best to help me. One thing that’s got me in a really good place rn is working on my religion and things that make me happy. And while building those up I’m learning to love myself. Going to church and talking to my friends there really helps me. When I was struggling with purging after eating one thing that helped me that might help you is I would always have one person, friend or family member or pastor who would be able to talk to me to distract me away from those thoughts. One thing my pastor always tells me when I relapse is nobody’s mad at me and it’s okay to slip up. Admitting the problem is the first step towards growth. Basically find someone to talk to you to distract you when having those thoughts and focus on the things that make/made you happy, like religion or hobbies. I hope this helped a little bit. <3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm an adult so my therapists have told me I have to make my own decisions, but I'm also young and I'd rather have my mom do everything for me. I've lost a lot in the last 6 months of pseudo-recovery, including everyone who supported me because I have basically ghosted them. I quit regular therapy and I've been trying to quit nutrition therapy and now it is only more apparent that living in these conditions isn't sustainable. My nutrition therapist said at one point that I ""already know pretty much everything I need to do"" which I have definitely read too far into, but I can't stop thinking that I am causing all of my problems because I like being difficult. I regret quitting therapy because it was impulsive, but now I don't feel like I can go back because money is already an issue. I'm just at a loss because I am ok with living with a mild eating disorder, but my family isn't. At the same time, my family puts no effort into helping me recover, and my mom constantly refers to my mental health issues as a burden. At this point I have no one else in my life, I might as well recover to get them off my case, but I don't want to recover for myself. Do I go back to therapy even though I didn't make much progress before? Do I start over with a new therapist?

I have gained a few pounds, but I’m still far from where I should  be, and despite being inpatient at a psychiatric facility for a few weeks, then, despite being 43, I stayed with my parents for a month, and did virtual therapy from 9-1 five days a week, but even after all of that, they cannot find a therapist who does CBT/DBT as well as having eating disorder experience. I am on disability and have Medicare/Medicaid, but almost no one who is a specialist of any kind, as far as mental health, will take it. Even if they do take it, people are booked through like August in many cases. Covid has caused a huge rise in Mental Health issues and Eating Disorders in particular (look it up; we aren’t alone), and a huge drop in the availability of mental health professionals. I’m only on here bc I can’t find a therapist- I have a dietician, but that isn’t the same thing at all. She is experienced in what a person “should” eat, but not experienced in eating DISORDERS. Every meal feels like a chore; I can’t remember the last time I could just eat when hungry and not give it a second thought.

  Anorexia needs professional help for the condition and underlying psychological cause.
  The question....How can I access the help if I can't afford it?
  Many people haven't the financial means to afford counselling.
  Without much knowledge of your personal circumstances, it's difficult to suggest a course of action to remedy this.
  If you seriously feel that you cannot get help because of your financial circumstances, then using a website (and helplines) like this will be a positive start.
  An option to try may be a  'self-help' route.  Not easy but better than none.
  You've relocated - which is a stressful experience.
  You're struggling with your mental health (and the breakdowns) in which you are alone.  Coupled with the further stress of needing help and unable to pay.
  Stress,  mental health problems and staying calm are  major contributes to your anorexia, in which you need to overcome in order to move forward.
  Firstly.  Don't dwell on your problems.  Get busy.
  Any jobs to be done at home?  Make it a daily routine to keep on top of it because you'll feel even worse if your home is a complete mess.  Losing the will-power to do the house work is a common problem for people who are alone because they feel there is no point.
  There is a point because it will make you feel a little more positive in yourself.
  Perhaps a delicate subject but  one that needs to be addressed - that's personal hygiene and fresh clothes.  Often overlooked when we are consumed in our depressive thoughts and emotions, to a point where we just can't be bothered anymore.  Made worse when living alone.
  Taking care of you, your hygiene and appearance will help you feel are little more positive.
  Social media, online 'silly' videos and non-educational internet activity will detract from focusing on what needs to be done and leave a feeling of regret at not being productive.
  Try to avoid boredom.  It'll encourage you to feel more negative.
  Read books on building self-confidence, staying calm in difficult situations, assertiveness and any related counselling matters.  Books related to eating disorders will help as well.  Reading will have more benefit than spending lots of spare time online.
  When online, keep it educational and factual and set limited times for either films, games, TV and any other 'fun stuff'.
   It's worth noting that even with regular, professional help - you'll still need to work towards your recovery when alone.
  With regard to financing, it is worth researching to see if you can access any form of help from the 'state' as some funding may be available.  Contacting your local health clinic, social services centre or even a community/citizens advice centre.
  With regards to 'reaching out', there are sites such as this one, forums, help-lines and other reading material online - provided by the public health services.
  Subject to Covid lockdowns easing, there may be social (help) groups that meet to discuss eating disorders and these could be reached via a health clinic, library or looking them up online.  It is an option worth considering.
  People overlook the reality of dealing with these problems alone.
  You really need access to professional help.
  Hopefully, if you can begin this journey now and keep it in focus, you'll find a way that suits you best.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

65,Aloneinthis,06-09-21,Struggling ,"I am struggling…big time. A little about me: I am too old for this, too successful for this, have my dream job and have an amazing family (from those on the outside looking in). I was diagnosed with anorexia about 10 years ago and was in therapy for years before my team fired me for non-compliance (they felt I needed inpatient and I refused to go). I was fortunate enough to be able to get pregnant and recovered enough to be able to carry my baby to term. I was “recovered” for a few years. Never really free from the thoughts, but at a healthy weight.Lately, the stresses of life have become completely overwhelming. I have gone back to my old ways of eating disordered behaviors. The restricting has become my way to deal with life right now. I know it’s not healthy and it will not solve any problems and that it will actually create new problems, but in the moment it helps to have the eating disordered thoughts instead of having to deal with the real issues. I’ve found a new therapist. I really like him, but I’ve only been with him a couple months. He doesn’t know my entire history. I’ve only shared bits and pieces to this point. I’m scared if I tell him everything, I’ll have yet another therapist refuse to see me. I want to open up with him, but I’m scared. I feel like I’m too old to be struggling with an eating disorder. I feel like my therapist will drop me when I tell him how much control the ED has right now. Also, my family doesn’t know I’ve been seeing a therapist. I don’t want them to worry, so I’ve been very secretive about therapy. All the secrets about everything are draining. I cannot keep going like this.",Annet,"Wed,06/09/2021-11:11pm","Hi Alonewiththis,","I am glad you are already working with a therapist. Believe me, it is NEVER TOO LATE to seek for help. In this forum, we have people of all ages. Eating disorders do not discriminate people. You can have one regardless of your age, body shape, weight, gender, social status, etc.I have had an eating disorder for 21 years, now. But I have had some times when the disorder has completely faded away. There have been other times, when things have been really hard and I have been in treatment.If you are now working with a therapist, be pretty honest with him:a) He will not let you go because of your age
b) He will not ""fire"" you because in the past you were already terminated by your team due to non-compliancePeople, circumstances and eating disorders change over time. You are not the same woman that you used to be some years ago.Right now, you are a woman who feels bad about her disorder and who wants to recover. That is a FANTASTIC thing and believe me, your therapist will be willing to work with you regardless of your darkest secrets.On a side note, my family also does not know about my ED or me being in therapy. In the past, they used to know but now, they think I am recovered. I am ""almost recovered"" but I still have some slips every once and then. In this last recovery attempt, I decided that this was a very personal thing and kept it from them.I did it this way because I do hate to have my family over-observing me when I eat or all the time. But other people likes to have the support of their loved ones. You do what you think works best for you.Hugs
Annet",Aloneinthis,"Thu,06/10/2021-2:19pm",Relapse,"Hi Annet!
Thank you for your thoughtful response. I was worried no one would respond. Yesterday’s post was my first one since the last time I was deep in eating disorders behaviors. It’s nice to be able to vent in a safe place. I am scared of going back to where I was years ago, but at the same time I am proud of myself for being able to restrict like I was able to. I am currently on a slippery slope of heading back to where I was. I don’t want to go back there, but at the same time I still want to lose. I stepped on the scale at home for the first time since I quit weighing myself when I went to blind weights. The appeal of watching the numbers go down is almost like a high. I know where this is going, but part of me is ok with it. I feel like I’ll be able to stop when I get to my goal weight, but I also know this is probably not true. I have a husband and kids and a house and a good job, why am I doing this to myself? I know it’s not healthy, but I also want to be able to fit into my ED clothes that are still in my closet. They haven’t fit me for years, but I can’t seem to let them go. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow, I’m scared to tell him about all the thoughts and behaviors. I’m scared he’s going to drop me like my last team did. If he drops me, I’ll be alone again in this like last time. Last time, I was forced to do it on my own without a team. I don’t want that to happen again.",PaulShipmanSmith,"Wed,06/30/2021-6:44pm","We're never too old,","We're never too old, successful or otherwise to experience eating disorders and the associated mental health problems that come with them.
  There are many families who portray themselves as being successful in life.
  It's all too familiar and the term 'from the outside looking in' sums the description precisely.
  It appears that you haven't really recovered from your eating disorder ordeal.  If anything, you've just lived with it in the background whilst trying very hard to pursue your life.
  It's good that you have maintained a stable weight, even though your are currently dealing with the thoughts that are associated with an eating disorder.
  In a way, you are using the eating disorder as a shield to protect yourself from the stresses in your life and this gives you permission not to face these realities.
   Write a list of all the so-called real issues that you are having to deal with and see if there's a way - one by one - you can tackle them.  They may be personal problems, other health matters, mundane tasks or dealing with financial issues.
  Whatever they are, try to deal with them one step at a time.  As you work on these different tasks or issues, give them the focus needed and put aside any distractions.
  Becoming overwhelmed by the stresses in our lives can leaves us totally disoriented, mentally and physically exhausted.  This can lead us to seek solace in either our addictions, depressive thoughts or something like eating disorders.
   Try to relax with your therapist and accept what you are trying to tell them will take time.
  Health professionals are used to dealing with different people and their problems.  Your therapist is trained to deal with everything you say and will understand your situation.
  What you talk about will be in the strictest confidence.
  Eating disorders can affect anyone, even in later life when past traumas come to surface.
  Ideally, a therapist with some experience at dealing with eating disorders will understand the associated psychological issues.
  Therapists may refuse to see you.  The client and therapist don't always 'connect' as often happens when two people meet.
  Not having the time to deal with each patient sufficiently, or perhaps the therapist may not have the experience to deal with more complex problems.
  It's not unusual for patients to feel overlooked when trying to seek help from any health professional because it's only fair to accept that their workloads are overburdened.  Especially if it's a public or community service.
  Covid-19 has also created problems to health services as well....
  It's a matter of personal choice whether or not to tell your family about the therapy.  People can respond in different ways. It's hard dealing with personal problems, trying to work things out in therapy and then having someone in the household either asking personal questions or being critical about it.
  If you are comfortable with keeping the therapy a secret for now and nobody in the household has any idea that you are seeing a counsellor, then it may be best to leave it that way.
  Maybe at a later date, if you seriously feel like telling someone in the family about the therapy, then do so when you feel more confident.
  At the moment you are struggling to deal with reality and the thoughts associated with your eating disorder are being used as a substitute.  A form of escapism.
  It seems you are addicted to the 'high' of losing the weight.  You admit to somehow going back to the past, which is likely where it all stems from.
  It's as though you are riding a very steep slide and zooming along fast.  The thrill is great whilst travelling down, yet it's knowing how to slow down and get of safely.
  The losing of the weight is giving you that feeling of elation and so is the thought of being able to fit into those clothes you once wore.
   Is there a desire (or a specific need) to return to the past?
   Perhaps you are not entirely satisfied at home or at work which means that you are seeking comfort in your eating disorder to make yourself feel happier.
  Perhaps an important question needs to be raised.
  Could this be about not letting go of the past?
  Is this wanting to return to the past?
  It may be helpful in counselling to look deeper into your life and past experiences.
  The clothes have not fitted you for years, yet you can't let them go.  This may be because you can't let go of your past and those old clothes are something that represents that.
  This could be one of the reasons you struggle to interact with the counsellors/therapists.
  There are issues surrounding the eating disorder, yet it could be the underlying, deeper issues that need to be addressed first.
  The counselling needs to be more in depth in order to address both the eating disorder and the underlying lifelong issues that have initially lead to this.
  For all that you have in life at the present, there seems to be something missing that draws this powerful need to revisit the past.  This may be something that was not fully addressed and you have yet to find peace with this.
  The battle with your eating disorder may be overcome when you can find out why you need to revisit the past.",Aloneinthis,"Sat,07/03/2021-11:59am",Paulshipmansmith ,"Wow…thank you for the very thoughtful response. It’s like you know me and what is going on in my head. I feel like I’ve always had an unhealthy relationship with food, going back as far as middle school. I’ll go through times of major stress and always go back to restricting. Right now, there is a major stressor that I have no control over and cannot do anything to help fix. I don’t know how to handle it, so in order to not have to think about it I go to numbing my feelings of stress by obsessing about numbers of calories in vs out and the “highs” associated with restricting. It’s much easier to think about restricting than the other stresses of life. I really like my current therapist and while he is not specialized in eating disorders, he does seem educated when dealing with eating disorders. I have been able to open up to him more each time we have met. I was able to tell him recently how bad the ED had been last time (not all details, but a lot more than I’ve shared with anyone else) and that I feel like I’m on the same path to going where I was before. It’s sometimes difficult to open up to him because of my former therapist. He let me go from his practice because my “level of symtomatology was too severe to be treated as outpatient”. He went on to violate confidentiality and called my husband to fill him in on details surrounding the ED. I’ve shared part of this with my current therapist and he was shocked to hear what happened. He stated he would never do that. I haven’t shared my fears of opening up too much causing repercussions. I need to do this, but I’m embarrassed I need so much reassurance about it. I feel very juvenile when it comes to the ED and what I need. I am grateful I am able to meet with a therapist who understands me and who has time to meet with me when I need it. I am lucky to not have to rely on public services and I am with a private practice. Right now, I am more comfortable with keeping therapy to myself. I don’t want my husband to be over analyzing everything I do. He isn’t a very empathetic person and he likes to overshare with friends and I don’t need that. I am very much using the ED as a form of escaping reality. There are things going on that are difficult to deal with. I like to be able to fix things when there’s a problem and I can’t fix this. Maybe I am trying to hold on to the past. My parents health is not great, I’m getting older and my kids are too. I thought I was keeping the clothes as a motivator to get back to that size, but maybe I’m trying to go back in time. I’ve never thought about it like that. I have always felt like I was never good enough or pretty enough or thin enough. Like I was not enough for anyone. These thoughts have ruled how I deal with people, always afraid of saying the wrong thing or offending someone, so I end up not saying much and come off as stuck up or not interested. You brought up a lot of good points that I haven’t given much thought to. Very thought provoking and a lot of topics that will be good to bring up with my therapist.",Mustlovedogs,"Sun,07/04/2021-12:33am",I get it.,"I also feel much too old for this, do you have anyone in real life that you can talk to?",Aloneinthis,"Sun,07/04/2021-1:51am",Mustlovedogs ,"Hi! Very valid question with a complicated answer. I am currently speaking with a therapist every week or two. This is the ONLY person in real time I can speak with about the ED (it is virtual however, not actual face to face, only through a computer screen). No one in my personal life knows I am well on my way to full force ED symptoms. I am naturally a very private person and don’t like my flaws to be out there for others to see. I’ve been through this before and it didn’t take a rocket scientist to figure it out then and I’m sure people are starting to suspect again, but no one has said anything to me (yet, but I’m sure this is rapidly approaching). I feel like since we are “old” that I am trying to fight a juvenile’s disease/problem and it brings out feelings of shame and embarrassment that I am where I am. It’s very difficult to be able to even tell my therapist what I’m struggling with. In my head I know that EDs don’t discriminate, but it’s still widely viewed as a rich white girl teens problem. I am no longer a teen and haven’t been for quite some time. It’s difficult because I know in my head that what I’m doing makes absolutely no sense to a normal person, but the feeling of accomplishment and perfecting restriction is so enticing and almost a high. How do you explain this to someone who has never had an ED? I also know that what I’m doing to try to numb the feelings of stress by restricting is only creating more problems, not solving them. So, why am I back on this familiar road heading the same direction if I already know it ends in destruction? It’s a picture perfect definition of insanity. And, I don’t consider myself insane.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have been there and I know it is hell...
Although I am an engineer, for several years during my recovery, I have been in activities/jobs where my body has been important...a) Fitness instructor
b) Athletics competition
c) ModelingI think a and b really caused my ED to get worse. Not because of my body's movement but because the energy needed caused me to feel too much hungry and I did not know how to deal with that hunger. Of course, I did not do it in a healthy way and spent a lot of years in the binging/purging cycle...Then, modeling... the focus on my body and the comparison with others drove me crazy.None of the above activities triggered my eating disorder. But they made my recovery a bit harder.As of now, I do not compete, I do not give any fitness classes but I still model every once and then.The reduction on activities focused on my body has really helped me to switch my mind to other type of interests...I have not stopped exercising but I do it in a healthy way. I have not stopped modeling, but I do not get triggered by others bodies. In fact, I get mad every time I hear someone is on a diet...
or when I see an emaciated lady...I should not get mad but it seems those situations make me remember my past experiences... Recovery is hard and sometimes we need to take a break from some activities/jobs.

I used them for a long time during my bulimic phase. Honestly, I do not remember how I stopped using them but it had to do with the overall damage to my health. At some point, my doctors and my family gave up on me.By then, I was tired of going to therapy, of visiting my doctor, my phychiatrist, my dietician and everyone. So, I said to myself: ""If you can not fight against the enemy then, join forces with it"".That played the magic. I stopped putting too much attention to my ED and instead, opening up to new things. Little by little my bulimia, my vomits and the use of laxatives got reduced to the point that I stopped doing it.With the above, I do not mean I completely recovered, I am still in treatment but I gave up on using laxatives and on my binges.

Our ED experiences are very similar and I feel where you're coming from. I have struggled with ED behaviors since I was 18.

Let me start by saying that I have not had professional intervention.

Thanks to you and to everyone for sharing. I'm new here and also new to recognizing my eating disorder, which took a long time for me to recognize because it looks... weird?I had been struggling with some anxiety because I moved, rather suddenly, across the country totally alone for the first time. A few months later, my grandmother died, also very suddenly, and the loss left me deeply traumatized and feeling more isolated than ever when I left my home and family again after the funeral. I lost too much weight too fast, and when I think back on it now I see it was a way demonstrate how much I was suffering to those around me who I still didn't really know very well and didn't feel comfortable talking too.Since then, in the past year, I've made great progress with my anxiety (which had previously been near crippling, nearly forcing me to leave school and my work) through counselling and medication; however, the eating disorder persists, and in fact has only gotten more complicated. It's hard to explain... I am the smallest I've ever been in my life right now and I've spent this past whole year trying actively to gain weight. I'm unhappy with how skinny I am; I look frail, I don't have enough energy to do my profession at a high level, and it's impacting my relationship with my fiance because I don't want him to have to see or feel my bones when we're being intimate. But there's just something about eating that freaks me out so much, as soon as there's food in front of me it's like trying to touch a burning flame; I simply can't bring myself to do it, and it feels humiliating. This dynamic has also made it very hard for me to get ED specific help. Many times I went to see a physician and said ""I am losing weight very quickly, I just can't seem to eat,"" only to be met with suggesting that I take a medication to avoid nausea and make sure I'm sleeping enough. No counsellor has ever said the words ""eating disorder"" to me, I think because I don't restrict calories, purge, or feel a particular desire to be thinner; in fact, the opposite. It was actually a video that made me realize that I'm struggling with an ED, not just ""anxiety around food"" because he explained that it's the obsessive preoccupation with food, eating, and weight that characterizes an eating disorder. Even though I don't want to be smaller, all I think about is how small I am, how I can gain weight, how I can hide how skinny I am in different clothes, etc. All my clothes are too big and I feel like a failure looking in my closet of clothes I bought for the healthy woman that isn't around to wear them anymore.I'm really hoping that seeking out an institution that provides ED specific care, not just general mental health, might be better for me so that I'm taken seriously and can feel empowered to take myself seriously.

i don't recall comments about my body from family or community, but i do recall the past family, racial, and misogynistic trauma, which caused high anxiety and turned into perfectionist harm, and later on, bulimia to cope with the pain. i was never taught to make peace with my body, which sonya says is a pillar of a practice in radical self-love and the body is not an apology. why would i, no one ever taught those who raised me either or those before them and so on. but i am in recovery, and i'd like to think my mom's mom's mom is looking through the window of my journey every now and then and feels maybe my journey is a break in generational body shame that eases their spirits too.this can all be a bit heady, but i just had a horrible slip, which left me feeling ashamed. i am reminding myself slips in recovery happen, but what did i learn? i learned how body shame shows up in my every day life. and naming where it comes from for the first time aloud somehow takes a charge out of it. maybe instead of stopping body shame, i am starting to be unapologetically in my body. maybe this reframe to love my body helps me stay on a recovery path, slip be damned.",healn,"Wed,06/23/2021-2:54pm",love in the pandemic time of recovery,"recently, i met up with a love interest. i've not yet faced how my love relationships have been effected by my eating disorder until now. i have carried bulimia around from relationship to relationship. i don't know what it's like to be in a relationship in recovery. am i ready?before the first meet up, i felt a lot of anxiety, from how i looked to what to do if there was food. i tried to work through and slow down this distress with the help of my therapist and coach. i wish i could say i came out the other side of this experience without acting on any behaviors, but i didn't. i had a major slip.what i am discovering is how tempted i am not to date at all. but my inner voice says, don't run. i can't shy away from every experience that fills me up with anxiety. that is just more isolation. i need meaningful relationships in life. but i need support to get there. i have started to unpack with my therapist, how i tie a body image to being desirable to a love interest and that is not only unsustainable, but not authentically me. to give myself options, with my coach on how to stay present rather than act on behaviors. and to lean on my friend and just ball over how this change feels like moving boulders on an oil slick mountain. even though i slipped, i'm still here in recovery.what has helped you in recovery while keeping or creating loving relationships?",healn,"Fri,06/25/2021-2:59pm",more on radical self-love,"i've been continuing to read a book about radical self-love. it's not an eating disorder recovery plan. it's not body acceptance. it's not self-confidence. it's not self-esteem. it's who i am already and have always been. it is my inherent sense of self. and that self has been eroded by many forms of body distortion from media to past trauma, and especially for me, eating disorder. so, in order for me to return to radical self-love within, it is about letting go of eating disorder behaviors so that i can let in loving myself, who i already am and am becoming. that is far easier said than done, but at least i am at a place of saying it for myself.",healn,"Sat,07/03/2021-9:26am",restrictive eating as part of bulimia,"i am noticing for the first time how restrictive eating and weighing are showing up and not just binging and purging. i am discovering that i find a lot of satisfaction in dropping, which is unlike the guilt or shame after purging. it seems like a perfectionism playing out, a control over my body. i am finding it serves as a kind of coping with my anxiety around being desirable or not or a perfectionism, not only about my body, but also about my work. i am still stabilizing my work due to pandemic loss. so i am grasping for a sense of control about what is out of my control. i know these behaviors are not sustainable. if anything, are further feeding into anxiety and insecurity. but i am still understanding how they play out and what will help me to cope in a sustainable way. for now, i am discovering, without the urge or even pressure to stop or change, which can easily tip into a shame spiral. not what i am after in recovery.
steady goes it. if anyone else has any experience with behaviors switching off and what you discovered or gradually changed, i welcome your thoughts.",,,,,,,,

It's wonderful that you have some support from friends; and this may be a challenge for you to make a boundary.  You have to decide what's more important … really celebrating with your friends and eating something safe; or saying nothing, having fear foods present, and freaking out.  Or maybe you could try one fear food and discover that it wasn't so bad after all.  If you want safe snacks, you must tell your friends.  You don't need to feel guilt, or feel like you have to explain, because it's difficult for others to understand our ""thinking"".You're in new territory, and you have to figure out how to move forward now.  Let your friends support you.  ""For now, this is what I need.""  When you do decide to try a fear food, can you take one bite?  It's like ""exposure therapy"".

I strugled with Binge eating long time ago. That is completely gone. So, overcoming BED is possible.
My story started with a simple diet, then, anorexia, BED, Bulimia, EDNOS and now, I am almost recovered but I have some slips every once and then. I also struggle to eat with people but covid has not allowed me to face that fear too much.Recovery is possible but it is hard work. It takes a lot of time. It does not happen overnight and less when we have lived with our ED for many years.Binge eating will eventually fade away from your life but you need to start working on your anxiety and on the things that trigger your binges. Also, you need to ensure you are giving your body all that it needs and to avoid restricting all day and then, having dinner at night. Restriction or an excess in exercise may lead to binges.At least, that was my case.You can do it. If I could stop bingeing, you can do it, too. Just keep working on it!Hugs

72,silverstars,06/22/2021,Going Inpatient...,"Hello,All.So tomorrow morning I am leaving for inpatient treatment.
I am surprised at how calm I am,although I waiting for anxiety to strike tonight or tomorrow,certainly once I actually get there.
I have been to this program before,but have always ran when it became too overwhelming and my anxiety spiked too high.
Also the last time I was there I was acutely suicidal and that made everything so much harder.
Thankfully,I am not currently in a depression,although my GAD,my OCD,and my social anxiety are still huge issues.I have recently begun to have panic attacks which my pyschiatrist attributes to my low weight.This time around,I am feeling really motivated to recover.I will be 46 years old in July,and I do not want to be 50 years old living with an eating disorder.But anyway,it isn't really living is it?One thing that worries me about going into treatment is possibly being the oldest patient there.I have been reassured by the pyschologist who assessed me that they treat adults of all ages,but it is still a fear of mine.I also keep thinking that what if there is a young person who is very ill on the waiting list just behind me who their whole life ahead of them,a life full of promise?
What right do I have to take their place?And of course there is that headspace I get into where I just don't think I am ""sick enough"" even though they have diagnosed me with extreme anorexia.With all my doubts and fears,I truly am feeling motivated to recover.Any advice as to how I can just get through the first week or so when my anxiety will likely be sky high,and any encouragement would be much appreciated...",Annet,"Tue,06/22/2021-2:19pm","Hi Silverstars,","Congratulations on getting the treatment you need.

Of course, I am not a doctor and I can not tell you if you need it or not. But that was my personal experience. I still remember when I started with medication telling to myself, why I didn't see a phychiatrist before?By then, I worked in parallel with a phychologist and that helped me stop binging.It is possible and you can do it. Just look for some help.With regards to the forum, there is always someone around. You can always come and write about how you are feeling. Someone will get back to you.Cheers

79,amattox,06-06-21,Question,Hey-I’m not sure if anyone can offer advice but I have relapsed. I’m trying to get back on track in an outpatient setting. With my job being my health insurance I can’t be out of work to get treatment. I don’t have a relationship with who i will refer to them as my biological family. I have been blessed with a second family. I’m not married and no children. What documentation should i put in place for the ED so if i would become unable to make decisions then I can have someone else make decisions and not my blood family? I know power of attorney but do i need anything to be documented specifically for the eating disorder treatment? Or if it would require guardianship then that person becomes that person? I don’t want my family to have any part of my care or decisions or anything.Thanks,Annet,"Sun,06/06/2021-10:13pm","Hi Ammatox,","Are you already an adult? You mention you work, already. So, I think so. If that is the case, then, I do not think your family would need to be informed if you do not want to. I do not live in the US, so I do not know the rules there. However, you can designate someone as your representative in case is needed.Use your insurance to get your ED treated. If it is not in a facility, try to get some outpatient treatment and see if that helps you. Maybe that is the level of care you need and you can continue working. However, if that is not enough, I am sure your treatment team would help you to explore other options.Annet",amattox,"Mon,06/07/2021-9:21am",Yes I am an adult and I am,"Yes I am an adult and I am currently in outpatient care.

My BMI has got into healthy range when I was a few kilos off. I am worried that I have pushed up my set point weight.When I was experiencing extreme hunger, I had to eat all the time.

I'm kind of perfectionistic, and therefore I like to complete a task from yesterday, the following day. I like that I know what I need to do. However the shift leader doesn't allow me to finish tasks from yesterday during their shift. They differ on meal break times, my tasks for the day, instead of just allowing me to hold the keys and continue on with yesterday's task. They have me begin an entirely different task, and it just seems so pointless. These people at work raise their voices and seem to snap under pressure. Some customer's are favored over others.

They would even walk a few guys out who seemed to be doing more Casing than Browsing while at Macy's.Well, I have 3 days off from my job and it feels good.My computer has gone back on line. It's on a Metered Internet Access so I need to figure out what I need to do w/o making the net crash on me all over again.During my days off from work I tend to Restrict, or Fast.

I would be working in a brand new retail clothing discount store. The only problem is that I have gained some unwanted weight while off from my 2 last jobs this past year. This new job would require me to at least wear nice pants and decent business casual blouses. I hate buying clothes if I have gained weight and inches. That would be the hardest part of this type of new job. Otherwise, I might miss the company benefits of where I'm currently working. But I was hired as a Cashier and now they are just trying to make me do technical tasks beyond my comfort zone, and would be straining eyes and running around w/ deadlines to fulfill customer orders.

You do you and enjoy yourself with your company, try not to let the food be at he forefront of your mind for the whole time.

Helps me not to get into a food frenzy. Healthy alternatives that still make you feel full but they stop me feeling as guilty and out of control after. Just little things that help me try and stay more in control of my ED than letting it control me. It's hard but trying to incorporate go to healthy snacks and a certain size bowl is helping me atm. If I got back to refill the bowl I know what I am eating now. Rather than getting non a frenzy and drawing a blank after.

90,Sabina,04/29/2021,Wanting to be healthy but not too healthy?,"Hi everyone,
This is my first time posting, because honestly I am so sick of my eating disorder and find it hard to discuss with people close to me.
Over a year ago now I started to get help for my ED, and was diagnosed with purging anorexia. I always found it that much more to improve as I was so scared of eating because I wanted to lose weight, and then when I would eat I would just feel an overwhelming guilt and purge.
I am now at a 'healthy weight', which to me feels like I am so heavy. A big reason why I was able to put on weight was because I started living with my boyfriend, and I have always tried really hard to keep my ED from people, to the point that I would eat normally when around him so he wouldn't know how unwell I was.
Anyhow, this was very important as I was extremely unwell and needed to start eating. However now, I still live with him, but whenever I am alone I freak out as I feel so fat now, and I end up trying to not eat, and then when I eat I purge - or sometimes I eat to purge. He confronted me about it today when he got home as he thought I had purged, I of course denied it but it has just sent me into a mental spiral.
I want to get better, and I know I needed to put on weight but also now I feel like I'm too much of  healthy weight for me to be comfortable with. I strongly want to lose weight but as I am with my boyfriend it makes it difficult for me to restrict.
Just really wanting to know if anyone has known they want to get better, but their ED tells them they need to be skinner, and how to get over feeling so guilty for not being skinny?Thanks everyone :)",whitneyaleksic,"Mon,05/10/2021-7:49pm",Yes and I’m positive most,Yes and I’m positive most people with eating disorders feel this way when it comes to part of you wanting to recover and the ED voice telling you just a few more pounds.

I still want to be sick and I am still so fixated on the wrong things like getting a diagnosis or numbers, etc. I thought this might be a good place to see what other people say because I often see misrepresentation of EDs in other resources.

I am technically at a healthy weight, which makes me think that I am not sick enough for anyone to believe me if I tell them. I just want the validation of a diagnosis, and I want some form of treatment to get me out of this mindset, yet the thought of treatment terrifies me, because I will have no control over anything anymore. All I want is a diagnosis to validate me, but if they diagnose me, will I be sent into treatment against my will? How do I even get a diagnosis without my parents knowing? I just want the diagnosis without my parents, and to move on and not go to treatment. Is that possible? Of course being recovered sounds like a dream, but nothing scares me more than the thought that I won't have any control. I have recovered from laxative abuse because a friend helped me to finally do it after months. I am grateful for that, but the fact that I did that makes me think I am not sick enough. Everything else I am going through STILL like with eating feels so illegitimate because of my weight. Even the one friend I told doesn't fully believe it's a problem because I ""look healthy"". It constantly makes me feel like I am not doing enough to be sick enough for this to be a valid problem. I always feel that I need the validation that this is real, but once this friend did suggest it might be a real problem, suddenly I was quick to shut them down because this isn't a big ENOUGh issue. It's just a back and forth between wanting to be taken seriously but not seriously ENOUGH that I have to ""get help"". I don't feel comfortable telling anyone I have a real ED, and even coming on here makes me feel like a fraud because I could be just making this all up.

The following statement lets me perceive how exhausted you feel:

Anemia may be one of the causes but it would be worth to explore if you are also suffering from some depression. Not sleeping and restricting may be contributing to the situation.I would say, take one task at a time. For example: treat your anemia and ensure you get your iron levels back to normal. Eat... I know it is easier said than done BUT we do need to eat. The more we restrict, the more our body thinks there is a famine and starts slowing our metabolism down.

98,yvist_,05-02-21,Extreme hunger or mental/emotional craving?,"Hi, it is my first time posting here and I am not an English native speaker, so if anything sounds odd, please excuse me.
I am around 3 months in recovery, after being anorexic for approx. half a year. Ever since I started recovery, I haven't been restricting myself on food or forcing myself to workout. And given my anorexic period was pretty short, I thought extreme hunger would be gone very soon. But til now, I still occasionally experience it. Sometimes I couldn't even tell if it was extreme hunger or mental craving. Like sometimes I did not crave food but just wanted to have some spontaneously. And I would end up eating a lot (not in a binging manner, but slowly and sort of mindfully cuz I did ask my body if it was full).
To my understanding, extreme hunger means a strong urge to eat and a bottomless pit. When I experience the kind of hunger I mentioned, I don't feel an urge but I do have an insatiable appetite.
So is it extreme hunger, or not?
FYI, i am not trying to distinguish them so that I could only choose to satisfy the extreme hunger and ignore the mental cravings. I simply wanted to know how far I have gone on the recovery journey since I know the vanish of extreme hunger is one of the milestones and I really want to get there.
Plus my weight has restored, and i had only 6 months of anorexia, I should recover very soon... right?",kcporter6,"Mon,05/03/2021-7:39am",SAME,"I also was only anorexic for about 6 months before I was forced into recovery, and the weight restoration was easy for me because of extreme hunger. I ate like everything for several weeks/months  and gained the weight back quickly. In my NOT professional opinion, it doesn't matter how long you were ill, you were extremely deprived no matter what. I still eat ""more than a usual amount"" frequently, but it was pretty clear when the compensation for starving was finished. And regarding cravings/mental hunger/etc., again in my opinion, I think eating too much food will never be as bad as demonizing yourself or others for doing so. The stigma does more harm than the act.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Does anyone know roughly what I should eat as someone who is already at a healthy weight?

I've tried to recover several times now, but every time I end up getting nowhere.

If you've had a meal plan, therapy, and parents who have supported you, what do you think is holding you back?  Who did your initial food plan?  What it a dietitian?  Can you do a new one?  It's important that you have foods that you like … and variety.  To go back to the old one doesn't sound like it's going to work for you.  You can also add in a treat now-and-then; sometimes every day, if it's small.  I've done that for years … it keeps me from feeling deprived.  You say that you want to gain weight, and yet I'm wondering if you're afraid of that.  Sometimes gaining weight can bring on the fear that you won't be able to stop.  Do you have that fear?  I'm new here, so I'm wondering if your ""relapse"" is avoiding food … simply not eating.  It's sometimes easy to know what we need to do, but extremely difficult to actually do it.  If you can write down your fears when you're confronted with eating, maybe that will help.  Talk it out with your therapist.

Recovery has to be something that you want … you, not ""them"".If you have support groups, then why do you say that you're doing this all alone.  A support group is a support group … what is the reason that you can't use some in this group to give you support?
A text, a phone call?  Is there someone you trust? Can you work out a system?...when you're tempted, send a text first?  If the person can't respond, perhaps just texting a ""vent"" will stop the ED process.  It's worked for me … sometimes. :-)It's very difficult to recover when you're totally on your own.

105,DonAdele,04/26/2021,Wanting to stop a Behavior,"Hi … I'm new here; although I've been with other support groups (live and online) for many years.  I was bulimic for 40 years and have over 10 years of recovery.  Now I'm struggling with complex post traumatic stress disorder, and have been using chewing/spitting to cope or console myself.  Select ""foods"" are giving me comfort.  I want to stop this behavior.  I'm in therapy, but ED's are not my therapist's strongpoint.  We're working more on the traumas, and doing some couple's counseling.  I would love some support from others who understand EDs.  I also hope that I can give support too, as I've had a lot of experience in recovery.  A huge part of this journey will be discovering a new purpose in life … that, I think is the major obstacle in my way.  Another problem is isolation … way before COVID. I look forward to someone saying, ""Hi"", and then I can get to work. :-)",Annet,"Mon,04/26/2021-9:52pm","Hi Don Adele,","Welcome to the forum and Congratulations on letting your bulimic behaviours behind!
I also struggled with bulimia and recovered. Now, I have OSFED with some anorexic tendencies.
Although I am ""normal"" most of the time, I still struggle with purgative anorexia, restriction or over-exercising every once and then (when life gets hard).I do not have any experience with Cheewing and spitting disorder. However, I hope some of the members of this forum can provide you with some inputs in that regard.If you are working on your PTSD, I am sure that will help you with your c/s issues. PTSD causes a lot of anxiety and as result, we tend to cope with our ED. In your case and due to your history, I am sure you did not want to deal with Bulimia. I know it is hell. So, you chose (uncounsciously, of course!) ""something less damaging"" that at the end is also an ED but saves you the pain of over-eating and vomiting.It is the same ED thing but with another mask. Fortunately, you are already getting treatment and your experience with overcoming bulimia will help you get rid of c/s quickly.You can do it. I am sure of it. Just do not stop working on modifying those behaviours. Hugs
Annet",DonAdele,"Sun,05/02/2021-7:01am", Getting Started,"Hi Annette.  I have to say this c/s didn't start unconsciously … I've been doing it quite a while, but in recent months it's become way out of control.  I got myself a small support team together, and now I can get more ""real time"" support … like texting when someone's already gone to bed, if I need to vent, or I'm having a struggle. I can also text during the day if I'm tempted to go to the store, and need a, ""no you don't"".  I just started this 2 days ago and had 2 good days, but not tonight.  Smaller amount,  but I was so hyper … mercy!  I can share more specifics as I go along.  There are 2 parts to this and I'm only doing part 1 now, which is no junk food from the store.  Every time I have a victory, I put a little star on my calendar; when I start Part #2 and have a victory, then I get 2 stars.  I'll see how this works.  Tell me what OSFED stands for.  That's new to me. I'm glad you've recovered from bulimia … that certainly is a hell we don't need.  One thing about any disorder is the feeling of shame, and the entrapment … like we'll never stop and our lives will revolve around these behaviors forever.  That has c/s right up there with everything else … you can't stop and your trapped.  I have a plan.  Now I have to work it.  If it doesn't work, then I'll need to be creative and come up with something else.Thanks again for posting!I'm not working much on trauma, in fact, I'm stopping.  My therapist has not helped me, in 3 years.  We just don't match well at all.  I've stayed for several reasons, but no more.  I'm looking for someone else.  I guess it hasn't all been wasted since my husband and I will be doing couple's therapy.  That's going to be a real challenge since I've lived with a narcissistic controller for decades.  It seems I'm having a metamorphisis over the week-end because all-of-a-sudden I'm starting to feel ""boundaries"" taking place.  I've been a people pleaser all my life, but with my husband, I'm also compliant and submissive.  No longer.  I hope.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have suffered from my ED for a really long time now and am experiencing some of the fallout from a long term ED. I was out for a really easy jog the other day and my pelvis stress fractured in 4 places without warning. I have been trying to be easy on my pelvis and lost my balance the other day falling and landing full force on my sternum on a table corner and now that's fractured too. I can't help feeling that in some way I deserve all this. I made choices that have resulted in this and now I have to live with the consequences. I have to say, it's pretty challenging being in this much pain. I feel very frustrated having to ask people for help etc. I can't even fasten my own seatbelt right now! Ugh.",Annet,"Thu,04/29/2021-10:05pm","Hi HeroCat,","I am sorry to hear about your pain and the long term consequences your ED is having to your body.
I am experiencing something similar. I live in pain all day long and doctors just can not figure out what's wrong. I blame myself due to the 21 years of my ED. I hate myself for all the damage I have done to my body. But you know what? It is never too late. We can still work on not making things worse for the future and in remediating our current issues.The above does not happen overnight. It is not a miracle. We do need to do the hard work and to stop damaging our body. BUT it is NOT our fault what is happening to us right now. When we engaged in all our damaging behaviors, that was the best way to cope with whatever we were dealing with. We did not decide ""on purpose"" to damage ourselves.Keep going. I have seen my body is slowly repairing years of damage. Things are not 100% back to normal but at least, they are a bit better than before. I have faith that over time, I can have less pain and a better quality of life.You can get it, too.Hugs

Mental hunger is thinking about food or anything related to the act of eating. It may also be related to think how much you need to exercise in order to give yourself permission to eat this or that.
Some coaches recommend to respond to your mental hunger in order to stop restriction. Of course, they also mention the ""over-eating"" that may come with it.I know you do love food and that is great. I am just wondering if you have ever found a way to be able to eat some snacks in between meals? They would help you to avoid arriving too hungry to your next meal and to stop thinking too much about food in between.Cheers

This has been the longest time of my day after day of doing everything I can to manage my eating-food-addiction. It's so terrible not to be able to stop such an unwanted behavior. Therapy? Doing it. Real group support 24/7 doesn't exist. ""read a book, follow the steps etc."" Other addictions, tons of phone numbers. So much suffering in private. As you know from my posts here.   I've gone and been involved in ALL diet and non-diet alike out there. Always healthy and sensible but not a 24/7 support for my active extreme compulsion. ""Follow some kind of book and steps"" Been there, done that. If my problem was ""drinking"" I'd have all kinds of support. But not this. People mean well. ""Just cut it up in portions and stick it in the freezer"". Are they kidding? Give me a break. Not applicable for a hard core food addict like myself.

About talking to your family, ask yourself why you should tell them. If you think they'll support you when you're having family meals etc, then tell yourself that they will understand or at least try to if they really do  love you

I literally felt abandoned, sad and frustrated since my ED got worse (due to me being in bed rest) and also, because I got some suicidal thoughts. What I learned from there is that for us, they are our main source of help but for them, we are just one more of their patients. Sad to hear but somehow is true.Hence, inmediately after I was able to go out on my own, I initiated treatment with a phychologist who has helped me a lot.I continue to see my phychiatrist but just like that... as a doctor... if she tries to do some therapy, we just go anywhere. Our relationship got very damaged since them.I think that when we need help, we need to call them if they don't call us. Sometimes, they are just too busy and can miss things.Tell her you need her to be there when you are feeling weak or in a crisis. Or in case she is too loaded, she can also give you some other options. She should not say she will call you if she will not.You have your other options ready, too because I know how is like to feel ""quite alone"" or ""left by your team"" when we need them the most.Hugs and congratulations on advocating on yourself and going to the hospital.

122,silverstars,04-11-21,Referred To Inpatient-Anxiously Awaiting Assessment...,"So on Friday my pyschatrist got my referral in to inpatient treatment with all my necessary most recent blood work and ecg.
This will be I think my 4th attempt at completing inpatient.I have no idea how long the waiting list is simply for the assessment let alone when one is admitted.They prioritize the most ill patients first,at to be honest,although I am losing more and more weight each day I don't know just how ill I am.Just how deserving of a place in the program.I am really terrified of embarking on this journey once again..I have failed so many times when it got too scary.I feel this is my last chance at recovery.I really need encourgement to stick it out this time...
I know I will really need to reach out to staff that first week for help in managing my anxiety.One thing I am really scared of is being the oldest patient..I have this strong idea in my head that my place should go to someone much younger,someone with their whole life ahead of them,someone with dreams and goals and a life full of promise...I just feel so undeserving,although I know I need this desperatly to save my life...",silverstars,"Mon,04/12/2021-3:46am",Thank you....,"Thank you,admins for your encouragement.
I so appreciate it...",xellex1987,"Tue,04/13/2021-5:04am","Hi Silverstars,","Hi Silverstars,Firstly, let me just say how brave I think you are. I am also currently waiting on an assessment interview this morning for inpatient treatment and although it partly gives me hope, it also feels incredibly scary.
To put yourself through something that you know will raise your anxiety is extremely commendable and I think it just shows how much you want this, which is such a big factor in getting better. Unfortunately, as I know all too well, we cannot fight this illness alone - even less so when it has been part of our lives and our identity for so long. And that is why inpatient seems like the best possible option right now.
I know both of these things are easier said than done, but I suggest trying your best to do the following:
Focus on the long term outcome - yes it will undoubtedly be horrible and scary in the short term, but every time you go through one of these tough moments, it will be another step further to getting your life back. Everyone is there/here to support you!!
And secondly, try to put the worry about being the oldest at the back of your mind. If anything, your age shows even more how much you deserve it because (I may be wrong but..) I imagine you have been fighting this illness for a long time and therefore deserve specialist, focused treatment.All the best :)",xellex1987,"Tue,04/13/2021-5:06am",And PS - I absolutely know,"And PS - I absolutely know the feeling of thinking you don't deserve it, but anyone going through this horrible experience deserves it. We shouldn't have to do anything spectacular to deserve treatment. I'm sure you would agree that everyone deserves to be free of this illness and hopefully you can accept that you are part of that everyone! xx",silverstars,"Tue,04/13/2021-8:46am","Thank you so much,xellex","Thank you so much,xellex for you encouraging me and for your validation that I am indeed deserving of treatment...I really needed to hear that this morning.I hope your assessment goes well and I wish you all the best in your recovery.Thank you again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

124,butterbean1203,04-09-21,Eating disorder for 15 years and 6 weeks pregnant ,"I have restricted, B/P, or both since I was 15 years old. I’m now 32 years old and I found out two weeks ago that my partner and I are going to have a baby. I am so excited, I quit smoking cigarettes the day I found out, and I’ve been increasing my caloric intake—actually intuitively eating, not even counting or measuring. I have been so excited to start showing up until today. I am not sure what it is, but I am feeling the terror of the weight gain I have already noticed and how much more I’ve got to go since I’m only 6 weeks. I’ve been reading about how much weight I should gain per trimester, and I saw that most people don’t gain anything in the first trimester. But I can see my stomach poking out at the bottom and I can just feel my body growing by the day and I am started to feel this terror welling up inside. I am afraid to talk to my doctor about this because I’m afraid he will think I’m crazy or tell my mom and family (not that they don’t know and suspect, but I have always hidden it very well and they tend to turn a blind eye and avoid confrontational conversations). I have also never admitted it to anyone except my current therapist and my partner. I am just really scared because I feel so out of control already and it is so early...I am going to nourish the baby and I know the baby is the most important thing here...I want to nourish the baby. But I don’t want to be so afraid the whole pregnancy.

You will be okay. Please share all these worries with your medical doctor and therapist. In that way, they will be able to support you better. If you can also get some guidance from a dietician, that could help you calm down your thoughts with regards to weight gain.Of course, you will need to gain some weight. Once they baby is born, your body will help you to get rid of any extra pounds. Our body is wise and it knows what to do. Let the weight gain task to it.Hugs

128,2Healthy4me,04-07-21,I Sheltered @ Home and did Nothing but Clean House...?,"I had another day off, 2 more actually. This schedule for work is just way less hours than I was accostumed to working since I was 1st hired at the pharmacy store.I haven't eaten much since my short vacation from work began as of last Sunday. I am off until this Saturday. My days have been busy, up until today. I stayed in and did a new job search for a 2nd job to perhaps replace this retail job I have now that isn't meeting my needs if I am only scheduled 12 hrs a week.It's been difficult for me to make up my mind as to whether I will return to onsite teaching in September, or just try and find a new Day Job as my primary employer, and then keep my evening and weekend job as my 2nd job.My appetite has been out of mind since I don't have much to need energy for round this place here of mine. I eat if am scheduled for work mainly for the energy that the Calories support me with until my later evening break at work.My weight has been climbing, like an Ivy climbs a fence, slow and steadily.I am having the same symptoms as when I had to take a strong rx after a way too heavy period. I'm supposed to be nearing menapause right now. A year of no periods will be evidence for a middle aged female like myself, that I am menapausal.As I have gotten older I have experienced missed or skipped periods for up to 4 months. Currently haven't had 1 in the last 3 months. I have suffered weight gain, weight fluctuations over short periods of time. Instead of increased appetite I have mostly lost my major appetite and only binge sometimes on certain foods....If I am nearing Menapause then I wonder what I need to keep me from continuously gaining weight. I work hard, and don't usually eat too much in meals. I walk an average of 4x per week. But am panicking over this steady weight gain. The last time I had this problem I was younger, like in my later 30's and early 40's. I had time and energy to swim tons of laps at the pool and then work out at the local gym in the evenings after a small dinner. I am not in the same boat any more. I  changed since lost both my parents. I began working 2 jobs. They were conducive to no gym workout but still lost weight. Now since stopped working both last 2 jobs, and my weight gain is really uncomfortable. It shifts from my abdominal area to my rib area. It feels like massive water retention. I am a powerless mess. I am using water pills and moderate exercise, and restrict food during the day. I eat 1 sensible meal at dinner, on days off from work. I am still gaining weight and don't know what to do. I have tons of jeans that I had purchased just last year when working at Macy's. Now they wont even zip up and this feels awful.It seems like the highlight of my day is when I feel pooped out and crawl into my futon to sleep at night. My dreams entertain me and I don't feel stressed or under pressure in my sleep.
I miss my old work, and I miss Not being able to exercise. I hate watching the evening news when they keep talking about Covid-19.  I feel like I caused it. I had total control over my body and was steadily losing weight before CV-19, and before losing my 2 jobs. I now feel anxious, and physically uncomfortable in my bloated body. I cant change my situation currently. Life feels like it's passing me by so quickly. It feels like I am the sand that is falling through the hour glass. I have experienced emotional traumas in my life earlier too. It seems harder for me to deal with my current situation just mentioned. The earlier traumas in my life are mostly involuntarily forgotten by dissipating clouded memories in my head. No nasty person's judging or comparing me to the Perfect Cinderella whom they meet while at church or on outings. No blackmailing me emotionally by doing the ""Good Guy Bad Guy"" thing w/ my head. I just gave up trusting either person in my past life of loneliness, rejection, and struggle. No one in my adult life taking me in under their wing and encouraging me to fly to the highest level of career or self actualization. Just promises used and wills made to feel like they were still better than my 1st FT job when back on my feet after a huge break in life w/ my former XBF. Mom would get upset  over something and snap at me and say in a manipulating way that if I am not doing something her way she would remove me from her will. Just out of the blue during an episode of her moodiness and needing to oppress her own daughter by ignoring or threatening blackmail on me for being myself.While residing with both my ex and then after returning back home again, I saw a pattern that I used to be my fail safe way of escaping during times of sharp, hurtful, and emotionally abusive times. I would bring myself to the Er and confess to feeling awful. Feeling like there was no tomorrow left for me. In order to be placed on a hold I would have to act upon my emotional  feelings of hurt. I would have to do things to myself to prove that I  was worthy of a ""51/50.""  Sometimes I even missed the hospital and old drama when I wasn't on a psych evaluation. It seems safer and nicer to be on a hold than feeling cold, and lonely, and that there was no where else to turn to.

131,junebug,04-06-21,trying to be better,"hello. so its been a long time since i have been alright.
years.
and ive known that.
i ignore it and hope it ignores me, this thing that i cant even identify yet.
this problem that prohibits me from ever feeling comfortable with food.
im hoping to get a diagnosis, i just wanna know what is going on.
i want to know why i have such a terrible eating habit.
i want to know why i get sick every morning.
i dont want to do any more medical tests.
i dont want to feel sick every day.
i want to talk to someone and learn about why i react to food the way i do.
everyone around me is so worried and they want to help.
but they cant. they think its simple, of course.
they beg for me to fix myself, to take better care of myself.
but theyre not me. they dont feel the things i feel.
my dad called me crying because he was so worried.
my sister called me crying because she was so worried.
that made me feel so bad.
theyre giving me support, sure, but god, why does it have to be that way?
why does it feel like blame?
the hospital didnt even care that i get sick every day.
i went a few days ago.
I went. I took myself, and they just gave me fluids,
told me to see a GI, and sent me home a few hours later.
i was honest with them. they shouldnt have just brushed me off.
but they did. and it made me feel even worse.
i feel so weak.
every day i feel so weak and helpless.
im gonna try and fix that. not for others, but for myself.
i hate who i am. i hate who i am when no one is around.
i hate the way i treat myself.
i hope i will fix that.",junebug,"Tue,04/06/2021-8:48pm",why though,"this morning i threw up a lot. it was pretty bad. i felt really sick.
then i felt weak, and tired.
so i ate. and i ate. and i ate.
and now i can feel it again.
sitting in my stomach. wanting to get out.
why do i always have this on my mind and why is it such a controlling voice in my head.
i want to eat a lot because it makes me feel like im doing better, because im eating a lot, which is good, right? but then 10 minutes pass and its just instant regret. then 30 minutes later i tell myself to eat. because its good for me. i need to eat more. i always need to eat more. so i eat, then 10 minutes pass and i feel regret again. i dont know why my brain thinks this is an okay habit. i dont know what influenced it but god i want it to be gone so badly.
i havent been able to do anything all day because im afraid of being sick.
i just want to have a life without this constant fear lingering over me.
i hope i make it through the night without purging i guess? i wasnt sure thats what it was until i started reading these posts on the forum. i knew what it meant but never associated myself with it. im not sure why.
i dont have much faith in myself.",Tryingtoheal,"Wed,04/07/2021-8:49am",Seek help ,"ASAP.  it sounds like you need a higher level of care before this takes your life.   You can't heal or get better without help.  Professional help.  You can't see the inside damage you've done at this point.

i slept for a while.
i think my body hates me.
i made myself food for lunch, but now i dont want to eat it.
i dont want a repeat of yesterday, i just want to feel normal.
and unfortunately i only feel normal when i dont eat.
i am getting help, i am trying my best to do what i can.
i have a therapist im meeting with in 2 weeks.
i am going to try my best to find a solution.

132,nebula2411,04-05-21,new here,"Hello everyone-I've been struggling a lot the last few weeks and I'm not entirely sure where to turn. I'm 41 years old, married and a mom of four kids, working full time- a lot of good things in my life. But I've struggled with depression and anxiety, and impulsive/ compulsive behavior for a long time. I've always struggled to have a healthy relationship with food, but after having kids and going through some very significant depression my weight really started to creep up to the point where it was unhealthy. In 2017 I lost a significant amount of weight by doing a structured program, but after the program I didn't really have a plan to maintain it and I gained it all back within a couple years. So last year, I did the same program again, lost the same weight again and even more, so that now I am towards the low end of the healthy range. But about six weeks ago it's like a dam has burst... all my healthy disciplined eating has just gone out the window and I've started binge eating. :-( I've only regained a few pounds so far, but if something big doesn't change I know I'm going to undo all my hard work. And even more importantly, I know that binge eating makes me feel terrible, puts me in a ""sugar coma"" and a terrible mood, emotionally unavailable to my kids, etc. I keep trying different mindsets, promises, accountability with a friend to stop binge eating, etc, but so far nothing has worked. I feel so out of control and hopeless. I recently read a book about food addiction and it SO seemed to describe me- it's like when I start eating certain kinds of food (sweet stuff, etc) I just CANNOT stop. There is totally a compulsive element to it. I read something that was new to me- in the past I've always heard that the key is not to ""ban"" any types of food, but work towards being able to enjoy all foods in moderation. But this book about food addiction I read said that actually, some people really are better off in the long run by completely eliminating certain things like refined sugar and flour, because they are so addictive. (The same way an alcoholic might choose to practice complete abstinence from alcohol as opposed to drinking in moderation.)I'm curious if any of you have any insight into this- the idea of abstaining from certain foods completely just because moderation is so hard.Much love and compassion to all of you. :-)
NE",Annet,"Tue,04/06/2021-12:19pm","Hi nebula2411,","I am sorry to hear about your binges. I have been there and know how hard is to stop once you have tried one of those addictive foods.As of now, I do not struggle with binge eating but with anorexia (the purging time).
Recently, I have been reading a lot of ED books and I have found some theories that say that when we are in energy deficit, our body tries to compensate and that causes binges. Those theories suggest that if you let your body eat unrestricted, once you are out of energy deficit, binges will subside and you will be back to your healthy weight range.I am also not a fan of restricting because it makes my cravings worst. However, some things that helped during my binging times were:a) Eat proper amounts of food during the day. If you restrict during the day or skip breakfast/lunch, binges are likely to happen at nightb) If you binge, do not starve yourself the next day. Continue to eat so your body knows there is not a famine aroundc) When you feel like binging, postpone the urges. First for 5 minutes, then for 10 and so on. Eventually, you will realize that if you wait for 20 or 30 minutes, the urges are gone.d) Go out for a walk, take a shower, brush your teethe) Drink some water or some diet soda and go out of the kitchenf) Talk to someoneg) Do not eat aloneIf possible, try to get some professional help. Personally, it has helped me a lot.Hugs

137,2Healthy4me,04-03-21,"New Erratic Work Schedule, and Fewer Hours is Making Me Feel Powerless and Annoyed","My New retail job that was helping me financially survive w/o my teaching job, during CV-19,  provided me with a decent 20-25 hr a week schedule. Now my New hours are like 12 per week. My boss said that my schedule would allow me more hours soon, but not sure when????I always rely on a consistent schedule. As a teacher my hours are 8-4 during the Normal School Year...Then I also had my former evening/weekend retail job. My corporate retail job was lost w/ Covid and massive layoffs. I quickly replaced my 1st retail job w/ my new pharmacy retail job. The pay was more with the new job, and promised at least 20 hrs per week for the job position hired for.Now My 1 annual job is in limbo until our district decides to return to Onsite classroom ed, and my retail job is allowing me way too many days off from work.The ED part comes in when I experience boredom, and anxiety over being indoors when not at work. My car died on me last week and that's when my relapse to eating erratically occurred. I fast all day,  out of lack of appetite, and no reason to need to eat. Meals are usually eaten when I need energy to make it through my work day. So lately, I have not eaten during the day as I require less energy. My car's still at the auto mechanic's and I am feeling extra anxious over this too. I suspected that my car may have been messed with when it was parked in my studio parking lot. I don't drive often so it usually takes a few times to turn over the engine. Otherwise, once it starts it drives like a new car.  When my car was in a lot awaiting a tow truck, i noticed the front car plate frame bolt missing. When I drove last I definitely did not hit anything to cause this to make a bolt fall off. Therefore I hope to God that it was not tampered with. Otherwise, I am spending money at this repair shop and must drive it and re=park it in the same parking spot. If it was tampered with, how do I rest assured that this creep won't touch my car again? I couldn't place a police report w/o any witnesses, or proof. It was all based on the obvious speculation that a securely screwed in plate bolt fell off.....Therefore I am experiencing some frustration, and anxiety over the unknown. Like ""If x=1, y=2,and z=3, then what is the answer to, If X+____=Z?""  This requires some thought, right? It's like Pre-Algebra vr Pre-Calculus, 2 very different leagues of numerology...I plan to order a yoga mat from online and drink more water too. Only plan in my near future which I may have some control over?Bye, have a lovely lovely day fellow forum members",Annet,"Sun,04/04/2021-9:51pm","Hi 2Healthy4me,","I hope you are doing better. I am sorry to hear about the uncertainty in your jobs and your car issues. I also get anxious when I am bored or do not have enough things to keep myself busy.
Something that I have enjoyed a lot to do during the pandemics is to read eating disorder recovery books and to watch some videos from recovered people or recovery coaches. That is one thing that has kept me motivated to fight my ED. On the other hand, I have been playing with some kids that live in the next door and trying to enjoy my parents as much as possible (when I visit them).Life is never easy. ED symptoms are not funny either. However, try to focus more on the day-to-day issues rather than on your ED. When the voice of your ED or the problems around is too loud, go out for walk, take the fresh air or practice some mindfulness.Structure and control are very important for people with eating disorders. But I am trying to become more flexible and to experience a little bit of less structure in my life. We do not have to be so perfect or to have everything under control. Give it a try, you will see how you will feel more relaxed...Hugs to u

Because there’s such a social disconnect due to people maintaining such extreme physical distancing right now, there’s probably never been a worse time to have a mental health crisis like this. The good news is you’ve acknowledged you are in a bad place and need help and have taken the first step already. That’s brave.

142,pAIgEgAb,04-01-21,unsupportive school,"I went to an all online school 2019-2020(for non ed reasons). My ed got a lot worse Feb-May 2020 and I was hospitalized in May. While in ip, I took a final exam(stupidly) just to get it over with so I didn't have to think about it. Normally, you take the exams in-person but because of COVID you could take it online. I had an A in the class so I didn't really worry about it. The school has a policy that below 70% is failing and if you fail you cannot pass the class. Typically, your grade is 75% graded assignments and 25% your final exam. I was very sick when I took the exam(I know stupid) but they weren't very accommodating and if I didn't take the exam I would be failed. I took the exam and got below a 70%. Now, I have an F for the entire class on my transcript and it hurts my GPA really badly when I am trying to apply to schools. The school refuses to talk to me about supporting me through this and will not help me in any way. I want to explain how much malnutrition affects one's ability to perform academically. I am retaking the class somewhere else I just want them to mark the course as incomplete so my illness doesn't affect my college career. It is not fair how my health problems will continue to affect me just because the school is unsupportive to students with eating disorders. I am very unsure what to do and if anyone has experienced something similar or knows of any solutions please let me know.

But now I’m really struggling with eating and exercise. Especially the exercise is hard right now. I’m at a low weight and have some physical ailments because of the low weight. My job doesn’t help either. It’s very physical work.,Annet,"Sun,03/28/2021-11:04pm","Hi Blue44,","When we are malnourished, exercise is not healthy for our body. Instead of getting the benefits of working out, we can damage ourselves. For example, you can injure your joints, your muscles, your tendons, you can literally ""eat"" your heart, damage the main organs that keep your body functional and working properly.I know how is like to struggle with all of this and I struggle a lot with balancing my exercise. My body is already very damaged. So, every time I feel the desire to overexercise, I just think if whatever I am planning to do will help my body last for longer and arrive in ""good conditions"" to my elder life. In most of the cases, I realize that if I do not stop, I will not be able to exercise in the future (you know...due to the damage caused to my body).So, be careful with exercise. Some programs suggest to stop it cold turkey. Other programs/treatment teams just ask u to learn to balance it.My team is like that BUT as u can imagine, once u start moving your body, you just do not want to stop!So, whatever u decide to do, try to not over exercise. At this point of your life, it is ""not the healthy"" thing to do.Hugs

152,CASACERA,03-03-21,"know what works, just isn't there","I have food addiction BUT managing is possible, even though I have to continue to do the thing I'm addicted to for life. For six yrs. there was a popular TV show that started a club for folks wanting to lose or simply manage their weight healthfully. Hundreds and hundreds of women (since it was a woman's hosted show) logged on to the web site. All needed was using your e-mail and choosing a password. And there it was 24/7, weekends/holidays any time the need to connect with others who walked-the-walk as well. Maybe feeling up or in control when you were struggling or visa versa. No judgments. Just the very instant you might need a ""voice"" to help you stop what you didn't want to be doing or moments of being grateful when you had. BUT any time, any day...day or night. From everywhere the US/Canada/Australia the UK & more. And free to boot. It worked. I had 5-6 yrs.of management/remission
till the program went off the air and the ""club"" disbanded. Nothing like this exists now. Whatever is there is a commercial impersonal enterprize. This NEDA site is an exception but we just don't have the numbers. Someone can post one day and 3 days later there's a response. There's no rule but in order for this to help folks like me successfully we just need many, many more people posting 24/7.
I have a therapist as well, but I can't call her and reach her anytime, any day etc. I'm always reaching out to organizations where I feel they might just have the numbers available etc. So be it.

Although in the virtual space, we are here for you.
I do hate when my phychiatrist forgets our appointments! It has happened to her 3 times already and what made me angrier was that she did not recognize it was her fault. She always makes as if I had been the one who got confused. Last time, I got so mad that I re-scheduled to the date our next appointment should be and skipped that session. On the contrary, my phychologist has only forgotten my appt once and when she did, she immediately recognized it had been her fault and re-scheduled me pretty quickly.With the above, I do not mean you have to get mad at your phychiatrist. Confusions, misses and unplanned events happen. I am sorry you could not talk to her today. Check if you can see her some time later this week. Tell her you are in a crisis.Sometimes, as people with ED's, we try to dismiss how we really feel when asking our doctors for support or for an urgent appointment. So, please ensure she really knows how you are feeling these days.Try to keep yourself busy. It does not matter if you do not feel like doing anything.
For example, if you used to enjoy watching movies and right now that makes no sense to you, watch a movie. If before you used to enjoy talking to friends, call a friend.It will be hard at first but the desire and enjoyment of doing those things will return.Hugs

158,OliviaMaxr,03/14/2021,I need help now. Please help me,"I first started to struggle with my weight in early 2019. I was a freshman to a new boarding school in fall 2018, and since I was not doing any sport, I gained some weight. The beginning of second semester, I began to try to loose weight, in a healthy way: I was not restricting too harshly, I just began to eat more veggies and to exercise more. And then at spring parents weekend, my mom came to see me. We were at lunch with about 6 of my other friends and their parents, and I had a plate that looked like a lot of food but was not very dense. My mom called me out asking why I was eating this much in front of everyone. I began to restrict and to try to loose weight faster. I lost my period that June, but I kept trying to loose weight. Thanksgiving that year, I began to binge. I ate until my stomach hurt and my back hurt. During Christmas, my mom took me to see doctor because my period had not come in 6 month, and I began to take pills. But after Christmas, I binged even more. I was stealing others’ food from the fridge in our dorm. Then COVID came in 2020, and I went home. I started try to loose weight, and, because my parents were at home also, I could not binge unless they went out. I binged far less at home, probably once every two or three weeks. Before at school, I binged four to five days out of a seven-day week. I once told my parents that I binged all those food, and my dad reacted with surprise and asked me “how could you even eat all these”. I felt ashamed. I lost weight by December 2020 and I wasn’t restricting at all. I ate deserts atet I wanted to, and I could stop afterwards without feeling shamed. I thought I was better. After Christmas, I returned to my boarding school January 2021. The first three weeks went fine. When February hit, I binged again. I am again stealing others’ leftover food in the fridge and taking food out of the trash can to eat, even though I am well aware that there’s COVID and that I can easily catch it through eating what others have bitten. My period still hasn’t come, after almost two years. I am too ashamed to talk to my parents and friends about my struggles, and I kept it from them. But I know that I need help. I don’t want to live like this forever. It has been two years, and I really want it to stop so that I can actually enjoy my food.",Annet,"Mon,03/15/2021-6:34pm","Hi OliviaMaxr,","Are there any counsellors that work at your school? They could be some people you could ask for help.
From the outside, it looks to me as if school were quite stressing. Is being far away from your family anxiety provoking? What about the classes and the people you interact with?I also started with my ED at University. The only thing I can tell you is that the sooner you get some help, the better.Hugs
Annet",OliviaMaxr,"Tue,03/16/2021-11:12am",Thanks Annet! I am scared to,"Thanks Annet! I am scared to talk to my counselors and teachers about it, and I am afraid that they would judge me for not being able to even manage a simple thing as eating. I have many friends at school, and I have been paying a lot of attention to how they eat and how they workout. They don't seem to struggle with eating and weight even though they eat a lot more at meals than I do, which sometimes triggers me to binge after meals. I am also afraid to talk to my parents, because the last couple of times that I did tell them about a binge, they both reacted like ""how could you even eat this much"". They only tell me to calm down and to think of something else, which makes me even more frustrating with myself and leads to another binge.",Annet,"Tue,03/16/2021-11:13pm","Hi OliviaMaxr,","If you talk to one of your school counsellors, the discussion will be kept as confidential. The last thing they will do is to judge you. If you have any concerns, before sharing your ED struggles with them ask them: ""will this be confidential? Should I expect any judgement from your side""
You will see their answers.Being unable to control something as food and exercise is a mental health issue. Trained professionals know it. They understand they can not ask us to ""control"" the way we eat or exercise. It is like asking a drug's addict to stop consuming just overnight. Even though they have a lot of will power, they will not be able to do it. They have an illness.You do not feel ashamed to see a doctor when you get a throat infection, do you?
Then, do not feel ashamed to ask for help for your ED. A trained professional could also help you educate your parents on eating disorders, if needed.I started my ED treatment with a school counsellor and you know what? He has been the best therapist I have ever had. He saved my life from anorexia. Later, I developed Binge Eating, Bulimia, OSFED and other things. But I could not get back to him...That is another story. I just want u to know that asking for help is important so u do not have to carry with this on your own.Cheers

I lost my younger brother in December (completely shocking). He was my best friend my person. I struggle with chronic depression and tend to have a hard time functioning along with eating included when I'm severely depressed. It sent me down a dark hole that was a struggle to come somewhat out of. Still trying to pick my self up as there is qlot of questions to be awnsered. I got back to work thinking it was the best thing for me along with raising two kids. I couldn't eat for almost two weeks. Then went on to eating daily. Then I started to work everyday minimum of 12 hours a day for 6 days a week (sleep all day on sundays..)
I have gotten to the point I feel so hungry at points but I can only eat a few bites of something. And I get sick with in a hour. Now I eat something and within 20 mins I have this horrible stomach pain and have to go to the bathroom and feel extremely sick. But I have to sit there for about a half hour and I have just diarrhea. Everyday a customer mentions my significant weight loss. My vision gets blurry, can't sleep, Hardly drink anything, but gotta keep moving. Not intentionally doing this. I try to eat and drink but my body won't take it. I get really weak. I havnt weighed myself due to he fear of how much I loss. I dont know what to do or how serious its become but I wanted options.

Have you tried postponing your urges for 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes? Or to go out for a walk or call someone as soon as you feel like bingeing?
Sometimes that helps...
On the other hand, you need to have some frequent meals on a daily basis. That will help you feel less inclined to binge.
In my case, eating with people helped me to avoid binges... of course, this only works when they know about your problem. Let's say they can somehow alert you when you are eating much more than the needed and distract you.Hugs

But to me, the simple fact of being surrounded by people helped me to stop bingeing. Of course, sometimes it did not work but most of the times I used to feel ashamed if I binged in front of them.Going out for a walk was very helpful. Brushing my teeth, too. It was common to see me standing up from the table and going straight to the restroom to brush my teeth. Then, I was out for a walk OR I used to take a shower.Keep going.

Another example is many of us who have had a ""manageable ED"" over a lot of years and it is now when we are seeing the consequences on our body. Of course, we never felt ""sick enough"" and believe me, we were VERY ill.Karen Carpenter is another example. She died a little bit after being discharged from hospital where she was forcefed and also put on a lot of weight.

Has your doctor allowed you to return to the gym? I am not a doctor but maybe trying some physiotherapy first would be a better way to get your body introduced to physical activity, again.
On the other hand, if you are getting bullied at that specific place, why not to change of gym?
In that way, you can start from scratch with some new people.I am worried to hear you are still restricting. Your body survived to a heart attack but it may not be strong enough to deal with a second one. PLEASE do the needful so you can recovery your physical and mental health.Hugs to u

177,Blue44,03-06-21,Addictive Exercise ,I’ve really been struggling with exercise lately. I wake up very early every morning and exercise. If I ever miss for some reason then I feel guilty. I also went to an additional gym exercise class this morning. I’m not able to see my therapist anymore because my job interfered with my sessions. I saw my psychiatrist last week. I’ll see her again in a couple of weeks. My psychiatrist allows me to see her early evening after my work which is the only reason I can see her. I’m going to talk to my psychiatrist about the exercise addiction. My eating is fair but I think I’m still losing because of my exercise. My depression is still really bad too. Thanks to everyone for their support. I hope you all are having a good day,Annet,"Sat,03/06/2021-9:05pm","Hi Blue44,","I hope you are having a nice weekend. I am glad you have continued to see your phychiatrist. It is important that you have some professional support for your depression and eating disorder. When you can, try to find a therapist who adapts to your working hours.I have always struggle with exercise addiction. To me, it has been more difficult to reduce my workouts rather than to increase my food intake. It may sound weird but for some of us, exercise seems to be more ""vital"" than food. Don't ask me why.I would really encourage you to reduce the time of your workouts to whatever your phychiatrist considers is appropriate for you. It will be extremely difficult BUT if you do not do it, you can start injuring yourself with no reason (like me). Right now, my body can not take any exercise and believe me, that is pretty sad.Long story short... if you want exercise to remain in your life, you need to limit it a bit until your body is healthy enough to take it. I know you may think that you feel fine, that are not injuring yourself and that exercise helps you feel better. I have thought the same. But if we have an ED, exercise is not exactly what our body needs to heal. Think of it.I send you a warm hug and a lot of healing wishes. You can beat this!Annet",Blue44,"Sun,03/07/2021-3:16pm",Thanks Annet ,I appreciate your support and encouragement. I am sorry that you have had injuries and issues with exercise.

187,asdfghout201,03-01-21,Rambling,"Hi everyone,
I've never posted on here before but figured maybe it'd help me to get out my thoughts. I don't even care if no one reads this or replies, I just need to rant. I've been struggling with binge eating disorder for about 3 years now. It is one of the hardest things I've ever gone through. Food and self image are almost always on my mind. I honestly don't even know what my body or even my face looks like, I view myself differently everyday and it's really draining. I know I shouldn't have, but I bought a scale the other day because it was on sale and in a random endcap of target. I hadn't weighed myself in a long time, or at least been able to see my weight (with a dietician she didn't show me my weight). I have a number in my mind that I've been fearing for years and if I ever get to that weight I genuinely don't know what I'll do. I'm very close to that weight and that scares me so much. I can't stand looking at myself naked in the mirror for too long, it will trigger me and I just absolutely hate the way I look. I'm most insecure about my stomach, I absolutely hate it. I literally feel pregnant and i just can't even explain how much I hate my stomach it makes me so insecure, more than any other part of my body. Well anyways, the good part, that I'm proud of myself for, is coming up. I weighed myself this morning, kind of triggered myself, because my weight had gone up in just a short time but I don't think that's possible? I hope it isn't at least. I haven't binged super hard in the last 3 days either, so I especially don't see how that's possible. I hope I'm not deluding myself. Anyways, I immediately felt extremely triggered like I said, and just sat on my bed for a while just thinking negative thoughts. I decided to look online for stories of people who've recovered from BED and just reading their stories and advice helped me. I was almost going to download a calorie counting app, but I decided, okay, I need to journal, I think that will help. I haven't done it yet, but someone said they've had so many epiphanies about food and why they binge while journaling and I think I need to try that. It's just hard with so much conflicting info out there about BED: it's an emotional response vs its just a bad habit, you shouldn't restrict foods vs you should keep trigger foods out of your house, you should track your foods vs you shouldn't. It's hard to decide which path to follow. I think, for me, not dealing with the issue head on would help, but not forever. I want to recover because I am tired of feeling uncomfortable with my weight and body. I try to calm myself and think about how when I recover, my body will naturally fluctuate to the weight I'm supposed to be at, and i know for sure this is not where I am supposed to be at, but I still can't help but be worried that I will gain even more weight. I just want to feel comfortable in my body. Although I am aware that losing weight doesn't necessarily change my self image, I still delude myself into thinking maybe it would. I've been working on trying to recover from more of an emotional standpoint, working on inner child, working thru my feelings, journaling, etc. I do think I've made some progress, for a long time (months and months) I just let my BED fully run the show everyday. I will say I'm proud of myself for at least trying to take the reigns. It's better than nothing, and that's something to be proud of. Any effort is better than none. Although sometimes I really do feel controlled physically and mentally by my ED I know at the end of the day i don't HAVE to listen to my urges. There's alot of things I'm urged to do everyday and I don't do them, so why shouldn't I apply the same logic to this? That makes me feel empowered, maybe not to some people, but for me it does. Like I am not a prisoner to this, even though it feels like it. I CAN get better, even if that means 1 less binge a week, or one less food eaten during a binge, that would still be so good for me. i don't have the confidence to say I'm confident I'll recover from this, but I do think i can at least make the binges less frequent. it is super super super hard when i want to binge to stop myself from doing it. it literally feels like nothing else I've ever experienced. It's just this like craving so bad and the angel and devil on my shoulder fighting it. it really does feel like withdrawls, like if someone quit smoking. I think I read somewhere that food addiction is as addicting as heroin. That is soo scary and I almost wish i didn't read that, because in what universe do I think I could recover from a heroin addiction???? None. ANother thing that's really hard for me is that I do have friends with ED but almost all have anorexia. I don't personally understand anorexia, just like they don't fully understand binge eating disorder. I wish more people took BED seriously like they did anorexia and bulimia. It feels embarrasing to say i have BED to people who have the exact opposite problem. We support each other when we can but I do almost feel a sense of jealously. I know that's horrible and I shouldn't think that, but it's the part of my brain that wants to feel more validated and supported, and wishes i could be in control more. I hope that doesn't invalidate anyone, i know anorexia and bulimia are just as serious and horrible. It's just one of those twisted ED thoughts in my brain if that makes sense. We all have thoughts we know we shouldn't have sometimes. I'm just trying to take it day by day at this point. I do think I have made some progress so far and I am proud of myself for that. I hope if I write again that I will have some good updates!",CASACERA,"Tue,03/02/2021-8:48am","if I may , a question","""I just want to feel comfortable in my body."" When did you feel comfortable in your body last? And 2nd question , if that's o.k.? I'm also BED but I find that a ""binge"" means something different for everyone. For some it simply means going off their promised plan. Even just one compulsive bite. Other's dive into large amounts of just certain types of foods. Me? I'm an across the board all types of foods lover. Mostly balanced and healthy, but too much of any food equals weight gain for me. I was just told by a therapist that she wishes she had connected with me early in my life (like a teenager) and might have helped me manage my (for me) addiction more. Since food puts me in a magic place and I still have to eat, ""managing"" is fine. That way I stay at a ""comfortable"" size/weight for my body. It's all so individual. My solution is only my solution. Guess we each have to find our own. I do write a lot and find it very helpful. But the best help for me comes from relating to others who ""walk the walk"" so to speak. Who struggle like me and like me have those precious remission (I call them) times. Hope we both have a ""comfortable day"".CC",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

190,thelittlemermaid,02/28/2021,Wondering,"Hey everyone..this is my first time on here and I was hesitant to come on but I hope I did the right choice. First of all, I haven't been diagnosed with any eating disorder, but I suspect I may have anorexia. However, sometimes I doubt if I'm really ill or sick enough to even suggest getting help. I eat normally, or to a degree (however, I don't eat as much as many people think I should, in my mind, I think I eat normally but I wouldn't know for sure). I am obsessed with how I look and hate the way I do even though everyone tells me I look fine; I just want to be beautiful and in my mind the only way to be beautiful is to be super super skinny. I don't eat dinner or lunch and fast a lot. I also don't eat certain food groups and two days ago when my parents forced me to eat dinner, I felt such anxiety and helplessness afterwards. I get lightheaded and it goes black when I stand up every time and my hair is falling out, however for the past two days it hasn't been that bad, not like when it would be falling everywhere. I feel so guilty after eating, but no one knows and I conceal it very well. I don't look emaciated and I know I'm not overweight and my BMI is lower but not clinically underweight either. I look healthy and athletic and that leads me to conclude that I am fine and in need of no help. Anyway, to keep it short, I don't know what I should do. I don't want to embarrass myself by asking for help for something that's not even wrong!",thelittlemermaid,"Mon,03/01/2021-2:14pm",thanks..I'm just thinking,"thanks..I'm just thinking about what a good next step would be.

I managed 4 weeks of no binge eating at the beginning of this year and lost weight and felt so much better in myself but I have slipped back to binge eating every day the last couple of weeks and I don’t know why. There are some food that are the worst and I managed to cut them out at the beginning of the year and that really helped but I just can’t seem to get a grip on it anymore.

Give yourself a pat on the back.  I just say, okay slipped up today, tomorrow is a new day, and don't starve yourself.  It's impossible to lose weight if you have an eating disorder.  You need to get that sorted out first before you can safely lose weight, and only if you need to lose weight, ie. if you are obese.  That is such an unhelpful comment your friend said,  just stop eating.  Really that is not good, as if you can just stop eating.  If only it was that simple.  Also you don't stop eating, you just need to stop binging, big difference.  If you stop eating, you are on the starving / binging roundabout.  If you cut foods out of your diet, don't you find you are thinking about them even more?  Don't label any foods as bad foods.  I've had bulimia for 20 years, sorry to say.  I know exactly what to do, but do I ever do it, no !  I can give great advice but I never do the actions myself.  It is so so hard having an eating disorder.  Giver yourself a break.  I bet you will find that  if you eat normally without thinking about diets and losing weight, the weight will come off, or at least you will stay the same and not put on any other weight.  I wish you so much luck honey, keep going and be kind to yourself.  You will feel so great about yourself if you eat normally.  I know I always say that to myself.

I perfectly understand how uncomfortable may be having to wear all the covid stuff for 7-8 hours a day. At home, we have some vulnerable people and we wear masks 24x7. It is crazy and sometimes I get a headache and feel like if I were unable to pull in enough air into my lungs.It is work and sometimes work is stressing. Last week, I was super stressed. Time just did not seem to be enough for all that I had to do. Of course, that caused me some anxiety and then, I was either not feeling hungry or feeling super hungry. I also wanted either to sleep more or to move more.Our eating disorders are tricky when we add stress and anxiety to our lives. So, whenever u feel your face mask is killing you, try to remember that that uncomfortable thing is there to protect you.

208,bowgirl,02/16/2021,new world,"hi, first time poster here, hope its ok to share a little about my journey.i have an emerging ED, yet to be officially diagnosed, however my general practitioner and now previous psychologist both believe i have one.
Towards the end of last year, i started to control what i ate, as everything else in my life felt very much out of control. it started with skipping a meal here and there and very quickly got out of control. i soon started feeling a sense of accomplishment when i was able to get through the whole day without eating anything. my restricting got very bad and was soon hospitalized due to dangerously low electrolyte levels, it was then that conversations around ED's started for me.
I was already seeing a psychologist to work through some other issues, however she felt like she was not the right person for me, with my emerging ED, chronic SH and SI and just yesterday, when i was due to see her, cancelled instead and officially told me that she will no longer see me. I am devastated to say the least.
my thinking is all over the place. i dont understand my thoughts and why i think the way that i do. I have recently begun listening to an ED recovery podcast, which i am finding extremely helpful in being able to put into words what is happening inside me and understanding why i am thinking the way that i do. my ED has started much later in life and while these thoughts and behaviours are so very strong and controling, there are parts of me that know that i am unwell and want help. i love food, but restricting is so much strong at the moment and the desire to change how i look and feel about myself is taking over.",sockpin,"Wed,02/17/2021-8:38pm",poor you x,"I'm so sorry to hear all your issues and your journey, well done on posting your first post!  i've had bulimia for 20 years and it's so debilitating.  And a lot of S.H. too.  I'm so sorry that your therapist has left.  I do hope you can get to see another one or someone that can help.  It sounds like you have been really ill, restricting and being hospitalised.  Being in hospital, can that put you off going back to starving yourself.  Would that be an incentive at all?  As i'm sure it was horrid in hospital and told what to do.  I hope you can get the courage to keep going and try and eat something 3 times a day, the usual rules hey and food diaries.  Do they help at all?  I'll be thinking of you and wishing you well.  Just take small steps, be kind to yourself and don't beat yourself up.

For myself was a deep sadness, blue mood type of depression and then there's what I classify as clinical. Much deeper and enveloping. My experience has been the first kind and not what I refer to as clinical. I can't speak for anyone else but I know the difference for myself and having been in hospitals twice was confirmed. I never needed medication for this (gratefully) but my observation was meds. could be or were useful, helpful to others. We talk about ""stigma"" here and I think just going to a hospital with or without meds. often had stigma attached. That's many years ago, in my past, and I've found other ways to ""manage"" my disorder throughout my life till the present. This site being one of them.

What will all these middle class formerly hard working white collar workers do? I am feeling stressed too. Today was the last day for me to file my last unemployment claim. This financial support isn't bottomless either!  When we hit 0 funds we hit Rock Bottom. I am thankful that after the initial shock of being a CV-19 victim of employment freeze, I was able to fid a moderately good paying retail job. I am still awaiting my sub job to look forward to returning to. I just renewed all my credentials, and took the online annually required classes as I do every year.I am still browsing online for a low stress office support or social service type of job. But for now am working almost 30 hrs per week. I am worried that soon many of my neighbors w/ the coolest cars, and beautiful condo's and homes, will soon be in Hawk. No job= No Money, No Money= loss of fun cars and property. This will become massive soon as everyone's Unemployment will soon be cut off with a 0 balance for any more monthly government financial assistance.I am so worried. What will happen next. Massive break ins to local places of business as a social outrage being expressed at the most obvious levels, no jobs, extra time for unemployed-newly weaned from government support. They will now have time to think of ways to earn quick money. I fear the daughters of middle class families, who have run out of money may turn to human trafficking, and the sons to other forms of trafficking such as drugs, counterfeiting large bills, and perhaps even x rated modeling jobs. This is a REAL problem, and The Worst part is still to happen soon.Meanwhile I mind my business, work my 30 hr week job, reduced my food , and other items on my shopping lists. I have lost my big munchy appetite and am more hungry now for some ME Time. I need time to improve myself, I am not perfect Either. I feel the need to be more mindful of myself and of my thoughts, want to center myself through exercise and listening to music of the happy 90's.

Some kids don't like to listen, they are tuni g into virtual reality, and super loud base. Where is the reward for the free education, college will just be an expensive online virtual experience.

219,alligatorob,02-06-21,Looking for advice,"This is my first post here, hope I am in the right place.I am a 68 year old man who has been a binge eater all my life, my mother told me more or less since birth, certainly all of it I can remember.  I have been on lots of diets and gained and lost a lot of weight over the years.  My all time high was X pounds a number of years ago. Last year in the spring when I was at X pounds I started a very low calorie diet and exercise. In about a year I got down to X pounds and I have been maintaining the loss for the last 6 months. So success on the weight side of things. I am down a little over X pounds from my peak. I am quite lucky on the heath side, no real health problems... so far.However I do not believe I have cured my binge eating disorder, only held it in place with a combination of will power and finding very low calorie things to binge on.  Problem is as I struggle to maintain it feels harder and harder to hold the binges back.  I have urges every day, some days much of the time.  One thing I have been doing is eating a lot of low calorie foods most days... It feels like I am still bingeing, just doing it with things that don't cause weight gain. Not nearly so satisfying as bingeing on higher calorie foods, but it helps. I have to say I am not so happy with what the high mass does to my digestive system, but right now I prefer that to obesity...Problem is I still have the urge to eat high calorie things, often a strong urge, and it seems to be be getting worse.  When I was losing weight there was a real reinforcement value to seeing progress, but that is gone now, maintaining just doesn't feel as rewarding as losing.  This is the first time in my life I have had any success maintaining weight loss, I usually start regaining weight within days of ending a diet.  I sure do not want to regain the weight, and any advice or suggestions are welcome.",alligatorob,"Mon,02/08/2021-7:34am","Thanks, and I will call today","Thanks, and I will call today.Sorry for not seeing the rules, I understand.  Suffice it to say that my weight loss has been substantial, I am now at less than half my peak weight.

222,CASACERA,02-05-21,"handling my lunch..the nitty, gritty","Actually more like dinner, since dinner is lighter more like lunch, if that makes sense.  Later timewise than usual, but my breakfast was later so that also made sense. Felt what a rush I was in. Like out of myself wanting to slow up but unable to. I get to the point of maybe I could actually choke on the food and need that famous maneuver to dislodge it. This gives anyone reading this how desperate my eating food (all types of food) often can be. Punitive measures like ""counting between bites' only make it worse. So, good subject for my therapist and me. Always searching for solutions that don't feel like deprivation, something withheld like with a child. Lunch was totally enjoyable tastewise and very healthy as well. But couldn't chew it fast enough. So pleasurable, variety and taste. Included a friends home-made dessert. Was afraid I wouldn't stick with a modest but adequate portion. But I DID! WHAT AN ACHIEVEMENT! I'm here to state ""it's over, ended my lunch, like some sort of marathon. Now? NO FOOD even a snack till dinner which should be later as well. CC",2Healthy4me,"Fri,02/05/2021-3:06pm",Sounds like your being hard on yourself?,"I surfer low blood sugar so every 2 hrs I require a snack. If I don't snack until dinner I either feel weak, light headed, and/or like a grumpy, middle aged woman...My snacks are natural and I'm try and eat - and - daily.

Good Luck and Hope all goes well for you.",CASACERA,"Sat,02/06/2021-8:50am",thanks 2Healthy4me,"For posting about your own ""nitty-gritty"" for we are all unique. I don't get ""too hungry"" or ""weak"". Having had a generous satisfying lunch I just feel there's room for food and feeling slightly hungry. I have no sugar problem at all. Or salt either.   There is no judgement here. We are who we are, not only with our own DNA etc. but life history as well. But taking a snack bite, tasty, healthy and planned for mid aft. leads me to scavenging on and on, way past just satisfying the hunger. I fully understand the why's but that doesn't change the state of magic where eating food takes me. Do you enjoy any of the food you eat? You don't have to answer that, just curious.

The hunger, the ""blind obedience"" to this ongoing behavior, terrible. There's this message of ""you've done so much damage already, what's continuing and ""finishing it off""?  But I'm here, breathing  heavy. Dread having to deal with the ""aftermath"". The promises of ""cleaning the slate"" and starting once  again. Yes, there's anxiety but I've had remissions when I've also had anxiety. Just sitting here, not running away from this compulsive overeating behavior. Don't want to be dumping this here but who else understands but others who ""walk the walk"". Do everything to help myself but right now...well you know.  CC",Annet,"Thu,02/04/2021-9:59pm","Hi Casacera,","Once we start the binge, the purging or the workout, it is very difficult to stop. At least, in my case, I only remember having stopped 3-5 times... yes! in 21 years!
What my therapist has always told me is that it is always better to stop the behaviours BEFORE we start with them. You can stop before eating that little extra piece of 'X' food that will let the binge started. Other than that, it will be like trying to stop a car that is running at 280k/h.
Every time I read your posts, I perceive some kind of hidden anxiety in your words. I always wonder if that has something to do with your eating disorder. I may be wrong but most of us, struggle with anxiety and it can really make behaviours worse.Hugs my Friend
Annet",Miggi,"Thu,02/04/2021-10:10pm","Thank you for sharing your struggles with us,","I know it is not easy to be so vulnerable, and I applaud you for being so honest about your feelings. Sometimes it makes us feel better to just turn off our brains and eat, or not eat. But this will get us nowhere, I recommend you seek counseling so that you can talk through how you feel instead of silencing your emotions with binging. I understand how hard it can be to break this cycle, and I feel for you. I really do hope that things get better, and I am rooting for you!",CASACERA,"Fri,02/05/2021-11:25am",thank you Annet and Miggi,"Hmmm ""anxiety""? Webster's:""distress or uneasiness of mind caused by fear of danger or misfortune""  (just one) but which accurately describes mine. For me compulsive overeating is both ""danger and misfortune. When leaving my 5 weeks as an in patient at a fine hospital, in front of my large group therapy, many of whom said they were going to miss me was asked what I was feeling. I answered ""I'm scared"", Annet, I know I often say this but I only speak for myself as a diagnosed food addict. If I never had to eat again, like drinking or drugs or gambling etc. no problem, but I have to keep eating and happen to love food. But for me (everything's a song) song? ""The Very Thought of You"". Old classic. Do you know it? Next line after The very thought of you is ""and I forget to do, the little ordinary things that everyone ought to do"". My eating has an irresistible pleasurable place, blocking out my historic struggle and awful consequences. When you eat food is it the same for you? Folks use the words bingeing and purging and I don't identify with those terms. I'm a grazer and I don't throw up, ever. And Maggi, thank you for the suggestion and I do have a therapist (ED & addiction) and we both agree that if I had caught this early on as a teenager or maybe even in my 20's CBT and or an assortment of other behavior treatment might really have helped me. She and I have not given up. Way past the ""knowing why"", but a search for insights into what will interrupt this activity. Really helps me not to keep all this inside. So again thank you for caring and responding. CC",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

233,CASACERA,01/29/2021,awakenings,"That's a term I have heard a lot. For me it's getting down to my compulsive overeating addiction behavior and how to diminish it, make it less and to be realistically in charge of managing it.  Again, I only speak for me and respect everyone 's individual approach to theirs. When I observe myself eating food voraciously like a staving child it's so disturbing as I know succumbing to this overwhelming urge is harmful and destructive.
What I realized last night was that my compulsion begins amazingly before eating or even preparing the food. It's the mere thought of eating food. When I first awaken in the AM, when I have a lull in my morning's activities or chores, mid-afternoon, same thing or even after finishing a satisfying planned for dinner. Without awareness the thought of having something else, anything, the most innocent, healthy food flashes across my mind. So if I finished dinner with something sweet and tea, the suggestion would probably be wanting a taste of something salty and usually sounding light and quite acceptable to my very food aware brain. That's when the switch in my mind instantly begins. Where, despite the pain of my life long history of struggle and the depressing aftermath of overeating fades and I graze from this to that for an hour or more till I feel so uncomfortable but satiated. Oh my goodness. Discovery time. But what to do about this? ACT when the very first thought appears. That has to be a pre-warning sign. Now I have to recognize this seemingly innocent thought and find a way to combat it. Whew. Scary in a way. Unchartered ground. No guidance but my desire for improving my ED/BED condition.

I still remember getting mad if there was someone at the kitchen at the exact time I wanted to binge. I also remember beginning to eat and then, being unable to stop. First, because I wanted a dessert and then, because I wanted something salty and so on.
There is an anxiety component behind all of these behaviours. On the one hand, we do hate binging and do not want it to happen. On the other one, we feel like eating and like if our urges were stronger than anything. We also do not stop thinking of eating and how to stop bingeing.I think anxiety is one of the problems. But we live so immerse in our eating disorders that sometimes we are unable to separate the physical hunger from the emotional one and the anxiety and depression from our daily way of feeling.I do not know where I want to get with this. I just want you to know that I have been there and I know how it feels.Hugs

235,SLMaxwell,01/28/2021,I think I might be on the sort of path to an ED starting and don't know what to do,"[TW: Bad parents, mentions of eight and being insulted based on that, slight emetophobia warning]Hi...
I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to put this, but I don't know where to go and I'm scared.
I'm seventeen and most my life I've been underweight - I only really started being ""normal weight"" around the start of high school, and it was never anything I did, I was just born Small in all regards (e.x, I was always the shortest in elementary, and I'm still the shortest person I know).Anyways... My mom's been constantly being like ""you're going to get fat"", ""all you eat is junk"", ""do you even care about your body"", ""why don't you ever eat anything GOOD FOR YOU"", but... I'm autistic. She's been doing this a lot lately and I recently had final exams. I don't have much energy and she hasn't given me time to ""recharge"" so I just grab whatever I can eat without having to do much or any preparation because then I can eat but still have energy for more important things like school. (She also will not do this for me as she says I can't just ""have her do everything for [me] at seventeen"")But of course, she doesn't GET that. ...The other day I didn't eat dinner because just the idea of eating made me feel sick - I don't know why, there wasn't really a reason - and then when I was going to bed she lashed out at me for making her ""waste her time"" making dinner when I had told her I didn't eat because I felt sick to my stomach.
She blamed it on me eating a snack that afternoon - hours before she had even made dinner - and then went on a rant about ""how all [I] ever eat is a certain type of food! all [I] eat is junk you're going to gain weight like that do you want gain weight? i shouldn't let you eat that crap it's all junk""Next day I was too afraid of her lashing out to eat anything more than a piece of X. It didn't MATTER that I was in pain from how hungry it was. If I didn't eat, then she couldn't yell at me for eating the ""wrong"" or ""bad"" foods! My pain and hunger didn't matter. Nothing mattered.
Even when I got the One Piece Of X I kept asking her ""it's okay if I eat this? It's not bad if I eat this? I won't get in trouble, right?"" until she got mad at me for asking so many times.Jump to today. I didn't finish my dinner because it was too much. Then she got offended because ""what? you don't like my cooking?""
A few hours later I got some dessert because I didn't feel like garbage anymore and I was hungry. Then she said ""Oh, so you're too full to eat your meal but not enough to not eat dessert? You know when I was a kid if we didn't eat dinner we didn't GET desert.""...I used behaviors a few minutes later. After she said that the idea of eating has once again been making me nauseous. ....Even while writing this, I feel like purging in general. That way she can't talk about how I'm ""ruining my body"".
I'm considering restricting tomorrow, too.....I know it's bad and I know it's not healthy. But I don't know what to do...
I'm scared this will turn into an eating disorder. I don't know what to do and I'm scared... I can't see another option.
I feel like I'm being a bad person for, what? Eating??
Like, it's fine if SHE eats a lot in one night, but I eat One plate and suddenly I'm ""ruining my body"" and stuff. ...It feels like a double-standard. The rules don't apply to her, but they apply to me, I guess.I think I need help. ...Please, does someone, anyone have advice? I know I keep saying it but I don't know what to do... I'm scared about this.",2Healthy4me,"Fri,01/29/2021-3:33pm",It sounds like a Power Struggle between You and your Mother,"Mom sounds kind of really Old School, like The Leave it to Beaver always Perfect, doting, flawless mother of the house.As for now, accept what you cannot change, and try and take more Me Breaks to allow yourself space.When you graduate HS the College scene is different, unless you live at home?I always had a retail job so I hardly gave mom the time to gripe at me.

After months of the scale reading the same low and scary number, I am finally starting to see the weight gain. I have to admit, I surprised that I relieved to be seeing the numbers go up because I thought seeing weight gain would overwhelm me. But it doesn't so I guess that's progress. The thing that is the hardest for me is my body changing. I know I looked unhealthily skinny before.  Now I just feel bloated all the time and I'm starting to hate my body like I did before my eating disorder. I know I'm still not even close to the weight I was before, but I feel like I am. I really am determined to keep working on recovery, but loving my new body is really hard for me.

Positive body assessments can help, too.

240,bluekitty,01/27/2021,"Feeling alone, would like to hear some feedback. ","Hi everyone. This is my first time doing this kind of thing, so I am quite sure what I should do, but I wanted to try and open up about this. I do not want to trigger anyone or exaggerate my situation, I just want to be honest as possible.I am 18 years old and a freshman girl in college. Late July of 2020 I weighed X, and looked my heaviest physically. I wanted to lose weight so I intentionally restricted for about 2 weeks. I decided to restrict, (I do not know what correct term to use, my apologies!) because its the easiest method for me. I have lost weight twice in the past, (unintentionally, I went through a break up and just loss the appetite to eat, my first time experiencing loss of appetite). So because of those past experiences I decided to restrict. So after those 2 weeks, I wanted to keep losing weight but knew this was not a sustainable method, so I decided to use another method. Fast forward to now, I have ended up in the cycle of restriction, calorie counting, and excessive exercising, and I do not think I can ever eat over the amount of calories my body needs to function. I know that I am in it, and its like half of me knows I need help, but at the same time, I dont know if I can really do it, or if I can allow myself too. I  never had a problem like this before and my mom has shown concern once or twice but I’ve always brushed it off so she thinks I just have a new healthy lifestyle now. This is just the gist of the past couple months. Longstory short, I really don’t know what to do, and I feel really alone. I am extremely depressed now and my only motivation is to keep losing weight, but at the same time I know I will regret it later. I don’t want to end up in a hospital. I would really appreciate some advice or feedback on what I should do. I want to do better for myself but at the same time, I really just want to ignore it and wait for something to happen that forces me to stop. I just cant imagine myself reaching out.

241,imasurvivor,01/26/2021,Frustrated and alone,"Warning - this may be long, since this is my first post, at least since I have returned. (under a different username)
(Someone else has my former one - oh, well)Anyway, I thought I was doing ok; that I didn't need an e.d. therapist anymore, because I was handling my eating better, or at least my attitude toward them and myself....Now, I'm wondering, who was I kidding?  Was that just to make myself feel better, or was I really ok with it?  But I honestly never did have the opportunity to find another e.d. therapist, so it doesn't really matter.Ok, back up the truck, I am telling myself now.  People might get confused.  I was recovering from anorexia and doing fairly well, with only a few slip-ups here and there, but nothing too major.  And then, something majorly traumatic and devastating happened to me, and I suddenly had to flee from my apartment and became homeless.  So now, the meal plan I was accustomed to eating had to be changed drastically, because homeless people don't have access to fridges, stoves, and ovens.  It's prepackaged items only.  So, even though I managed to get all of my basic food groups met in the same way that I was supposed to, my taste buds weren't satisfied, and on occasion, I began overeating on sweets and similar type foods that made me temporarily feel better.  And for a while, I was able to tell myself that it didn't matter; that I am still the same person, no matter what, and I'm simply struggling to survive, so who cares what I eat?  (Administrator, I hope that's ok to say; if not, feel free to edit.)  But now, after almost six months of the same type of foods over and over, every single day, I'm getting tired of it!! And I finally got to come home - to my original home state, to live with my cousin, temporarily.  But even now, I occasionally will eat more than I know I ""should,"" because I am tired, anxious, depressed, etc.  It's becoming my go-to, and I hate it!  And today, I did it again, and at first, I told myself, I ""deserve"" this, because I just spent three hours doing errands.  But then I felt so guilty and hated the idea of having any food in me, at all, and I used behaviors, which I haven't done for ages.  And I still don't have an e.d. therapist, because there simply aren't any in my state who take Medicare and Medicaid.  I had one, previously, before I had to flee, and she is absolutely amazing!  But she has lightened her case load and doesn't have time to work with me, anymore, unfortunately.  And we have both been through the search for other therapists, before.  I did contact NEDA today to ask, just in case, but I don't feel too hopeful.

Besides, your ED already stole so much time from you anyways, this is just the beginning of taking it back. As for your friends/people in your life not knowing- I know it’s hard, but right now you likely need to just focus on treatment. You can explain your situation to them in a more calm environment when you’re in a more stable place mentally, and if they’re good people, I promise they won’t think any less of you for it. You can expect a lot of group therapy, slow days, more group therapy, and 1-on-1 treatment.

245,Annet,01/25/2021,Is complete recovery really possible?,"I have heard a lot of things with regards to this topic. I know several people completely recovers from their eating disorders while many others remain with them as chronic illnesses.I have been battling my ED for 21 years. Sometimes, I feel optimistic. Other times, I feel hopeless and like a failure. I often wonder what kind of patient I may be: the one who recovers completely or the one that remains ill forever.To my mind, sometimes is very difficult to foresee a life with this problem. I am fed up of it but often I do not find the 'strength' to choose the 'healthy' thing. Other times, I hear professionals talking about ""recovery"" as if it were a simple cold. They say you can completely recover from a cold (and an ED) but to get it, again.Unfortunately, I know pretty few people who have completely recovered and the ones I have met, I have never had the opportunity to see how their lives are, now. I mean, if they really got rid of their ED!Anyway, I would like to hear your point of view on this and if you have met any recovered people to let me know if they achieved complete recovery.Note.

They always say, ""You always have an Ed, but you aren't as bad off."" Or something like that. I always thought, so then I'll continue my destructive restrict-binge cycles, because there's no hope.

I also see CC's way of defining life with an ED as something ""realistic"". To be honest, in the last 21 years, all I have been doing is to ""manage"" my ED. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. But overall, it has stayed there, present in my life.
However, after all these years, I am still reluctant to believe this is the way the rest of my life will be. I am sure you know what I mean. But I also know CC has been fighting her ED for a long time with the same results as me... Sometimes I wonder what is that keeps me going. Is it faith? Is it the believe that recovery is possible? I wonder how I can believe so if I have years trying with no luck...and believe me, I really do my best...",survivingtothriving,"Wed,01/27/2021-8:02am","I don’t have an answer, but","as someone who only recently got thrown into the mess of an ED, I want you to know that I’m so sorry you’re suffering and also that you’re incredibly strong. The fact that you’ve been able to hold on 21 years with this absolutely demolishing illness is a miracle. I think our lives may not ever be the same as other peoples’ in regards to food and happiness, but we can still strive for our best. Maybe our max capacity for happiness is only about 50% of others happiness, and that’s okay, because it’s still our maximum. We’ll make it.

The point is I am going back to old habits, which I am aware they’re wrong, but I can’t help myself from doing it.

If I were in your spot though, i would say try to remember how much better you felt on your good days, and how much happier you were on those days. I can't promise you won't have any more bad days, but you've proven to yourself that you are stronger than your ED and that you can push past old habits. Just take it one day at a time and tell yourself that just today, you're not gonna let yourself relapse. It might help. It's inspiring to me that you were able to thrive though!

247,Victoria1992,01/25/2021,My story ,"So I have never spoken really about my eating disorder. I am nearly 27 and I have struggled on and off since I was about 15 with eating and food, it has just intensified in my mid 20s. Food for me is form of control, self harm and release. The only way I can describe an eating disorder is its like having another person in your head telling you your not good enough, no thin enough, to eat loads, to not eat anything, to purge, to get it out of your body in any way you can. There is a constant voice in your head making you doubt everything you do and always making you feel bad about yourself. There is no size or weight that is small enough.
I have gone through phases of being sick and then looking like I'm getting better. However only people who have an eating disorder wil know, you never get better, that voice is always there. I put on a bit of weight to please everyone around me, to make them leave me alone. Then slowing the feeling sinks in again, the voices, making you feel like you’re not enough. Will the voices ever go?
I feel like I'm always going to be this way and hiding it from people is getting harder and harder, if I don't want to eat I feel like I shouldnt have to. I have a major problem/addiction with laxatives. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't get comfy, I never knew when I was gong to need to go. I have tried weened myself off these and went cold turkey, but I found from alll the abuse I couldn't go at all. So I found myself in the vicious cycle again.
I feel like I have a really addictive personality and my biggest addiction is being thin and then food, I love food but I have so many conflicting views of it. I don't think people really realise how hard it is to have you addiction be one of the things you need to live.
I feel like no one understand me so I don't ever talk about anything and try and keep it to myself. Does anyone feel this way? I want to get better but I keep getting dragged back to it all.",Chessie,"Mon,01/25/2021-10:03pm",I can relate to some of your story,"I've never purged, nor been underweight, nor taken laxatives. However I sometimes feel like I'm addicted to food and eating, but at the same time addicted to not eating. I guess that explains my restrict-binge cycles. The voices(I feel like I have two, one is demeaning and mean, the other is nice and calm. She is only mean when I eat too much and always claims when I go back to restrict, she claims to just try and help me. Sometimes I love her and sometimes I hate her) are so strong. I agree that unless someone's personally had a food addiction they can't know what it feels like. the amount of times I've cried over a toilet bowl trying to purge is just pathetic and depressing. I'm sorry you struggled so long. ED's are very self-sabbotagy(I know it's not a real word, I don't care), but I hope you'll be able to feel better and be healthier soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They'll be nothing else after the snack."" Didn't work. My earlier sensible conscious mind knew better, but the witch with the tempting red fruit to sleeping beauty had it's way.

One time when I was hospitalized my late hubby drove up with the kids to see me he said to them ""your mother's a little loony-tunes with the food right now"".

259,dandyarelions,01/21/2021,Involuntary Commitment,"Does anyone know anything about involuntary commitment for an eating disorder? I have a dear friend dying from her eating disorder. She finally got to a treatment facility, but they weren't doing much for her (they hadn't drawn labs, done an ekg, enforced bed rest, no ng tube, no iv fluids) so she left. Because of that, her team dropped her. Her insurance is awful and she's having trouble advocating for herself by herself. Her family is uninvolved and not many of her friends understand eating disorders. I can tell she is starting to give up and give into dying. I am terrified for her.Would involuntary commitment be an option here? Would it get her to treatment quickly enough (she could literally die any minute)? How does that work with insurance? Who can involuntarily commit someone? I've been begging her to go the hospital, call treatment centers, scrap together a new team, and I trust her to do those things, I just don't know if it'll happen in time because her ED is minimizing the situation.Obviously this is not an ideal solution and I'd hate to do it to her, but she is about to die.

261,sophief1123,01-05-21,Is it actually a problem?,"I’ve been struggling with an eating disorder ever since my junior year of high school. I had anorexia and got down to a dangerously low weight, but was able to recover on my own and never went into treatment or therapy. My senior year of high school, I was able to maintain a healthy weight and enjoy life. However, when I went away to college I started to get disordered thoughts again and have been battling them ever since. Throughout my 4 years of college I have been dealing with disordered eating and over exercising, but I maintained the same weight. Now I’m graduated from college and I moved into an apartment with my boyfriend. I’m a very low weight (but not as low as I was in high school) and I’m noticing a lot of negative disordered thoughts. I was able to stop exercising as much, mainly because I don’t have the time since I work now, but I also eat very low calories. I know I don’t want to lose weight, but there is a fear of gaining weight that is making me control my eating. My boyfriend is nervous for me and is trying to micromanage my eating, but that just causes fights because I don’t like someone controlling what I eat or asking me every night what I ate all day. I know I need to gain weight, and I know I can fix it myself since I was able to fight anorexia in high school by myself. But I don’t know if I should seek help/treatment. There’s a part of me that wants to gain weight and eat more, but there’s also a part of me that doesn’t want to change and is afraid to gain weight. I don’t consider myself to be bad enough to get treatment but I don’t want to have these negative thoughts for my whole life. I’m just don’t know what steps to take next.",pjordner,"Fri,01/08/2021-1:33pm",I really feel this,"I’ve gone through a VERY similar experience to all of this. I often wonder whether it’s as big of a problem as I’m making it into in my head. Even now, I’m wondering how “at risk” my body is of long term health issues due to starvation, weight loss, excessive exercise, etc. I have already been through recovery once and relapsed shortly after. One of the biggest things I’ve learned through my experience is that the line between disordered eating and eating disorder is pretty gray. If you’re worried about it, I’d say it’s worth getting help for— regardless of whether you wanna call it an ED or disordered eating. It’s clearly affecting your life! And your partner is also noticing these behaviors. If you can afford treatment, I would never advise against it!! I’m starting to be able to distinguish the ED in my head from my actual loving, compassionate, kind self. And whenever my REAL self acknowledges that I want to eat and gain weight and be HEALTHY, my ED is the voice that pushes back and tells me I’m better off starving and unhappy. Just a thought! Once I started identifying the ED thoughts as different from who I am, it became easier to say “stfu” in response! :) I wish you courage and strength through this.

While it isn’t anything monumental, it feels extremely invigorating to know that I’m actively trying to get better. I recently had a talk with my parents about the severity of my ED and they took it very seriously. They already had suspicions something was wrong, but after having the talk with them, they decided to contact more doctors to get a formal diagnosis. This felt like a huge step forward as in my past doctors appointments, it felt as if my condition wasn’t being taken seriously, but now I’m actually going to receive treatment. However, theres just one thing thats been a bit of a problem, and its the fact that my parents (divorced) have different ideas of what will help me get better. My mom thinks only the doctors will be of any help, but my dad wants to introduce me to appetite stimulants in order to increase my caloric intake. TBH I’m a bit lost as to which one to follow as I know if I continue on my current “diet” my health will only get worse as I wait for the doctors to introduce treatment (can take a few months). But with my dad’s solution, I know it could get out of hand quickly if I become too reliant on the stimulants. I’m not really sure which is best, but for now I’m just trying my best to take small steps to recovery.

270,jndyat,01/16/2021,Recovering alone without getting any professional help,"It has been 2 years since I first started to think that this has to stop. Now I haven’t had any medical or professional help, my parents does know about what I’m going through (one day when I was at the lowest of my anorexia, I sent an article of anorexia and its symptoms to my sister for her to send to my parents- because I was a coward to send it to them directly). My parents did bring me to a doctor, but it was our family doctor, an old man who I really do like. But since I didn’t say anything to that doctor, he just dismissed it as me being in a diet as a teenager. So when I decided to stop restricting and start eating, I think my parents might’ve thought that ‘hey she’s better already’.
In the 2 years or my supposedly lonely ‘recovery’, my anorexia has evolved into going back and forward from binge eating and bulimia. My physical health might be getting better, I no longer have heart palpitations and my menstruation cycle is back to normal. But I’m pretty sure my mental health is not getting better. I still have the same mindset as I do 5 years ago. I’m still afraid of gaining weight, I still feel like if I’m not at this ‘certain’ weight then there’s no point in anything.
I know I should’ve asked for professional help, or a nutritionist to help plan the right meal plan for the recovery 2 years ago. But when my parents stop looking like they were worried, I can’t get myself to disappoint them again.

They are the only ones thag can help break the cycles of negative thinking, help you identify triggers and how to cope.  There is no good timing.

Ugh, I just don't know if I'm eating too much. Does anybody have any advice? Thank you :)",rayman,"Wed,01/13/2021-7:07pm",In Response,"Hey Chessie. First congrats it's brave of you to be trying. I would get a Dietician one experienced with eating disorders (most are covered by insurance). They can totally advise you with all your concerns and worries. I will say from experience, if you have been restricting your stomach shrinks and in addition when you consume food this can create a triggering response in your gut. Eating more may produce refeeding symptoms so I would be careful. A Dietician can properly advise and help you pace your recovery.",Chessie,"Wed,01/13/2021-9:24pm",Rayman,"Okay.

I want to use that fear to help me when I start eating and be able to stop at the end of a meal or snack. No matter what the food, even what folks refer to as the healthiest (because I love it all) and watch myself  continue on like a robot. All my historic struggle and pain fade away. Me the addict. Looked that up too. I am afraid and very careful around my glass top stove 'cause I was burned recently. Isn't that a good fear? CC",rayman,"Wed,01/13/2021-3:00pm",In Response to Fear,"Hey CASACERA. In response to fear here is an explanation on whether or not that fear is good or harmful (anxiety). I will say are these thoughts and feelings realistic? Are they useful and realistic to your health? As a parent of a child with anxiety and an individual with Anorexia and GAD I will answer as best I can. Both fear and anxiety are alerting signals, they appear to prepare the body for different actions. Anxiety is a generalized response to an unknown threat or internal conflict, whereas fear is focused on known external danger. So ask yourself are these thoughts you shared an internal conflict or an actual danger? Healthy fear keeps us safe and healthy for survival. Anxiety is more worrisome and more likely based on unrealistic/unhealthy fears.",CASACERA,"Thu,01/14/2021-8:44am","hi rayman, thanks for responding","O.K. here is an answer to your first two questions. ""are they good or harmful and /or useful and realistic...""  Yes to both. Both are real and a danger to my physical and emotional health. Since our life situations are individual and unique, I simply speak for myself. If someone relates to their own situation, challenge or struggle... great!

Eating too much at once may actually biologically trigger your trauma. Try getting a certified Dietician to help with this, one that specializes on EDs.

Last night I came home and ate a few snack foods. Then finally fell asleep. I forgot to spray my lavender room aroma for sleeping spray. This morning slept in an hour of so extra. Upon awakening, I just wanted to dive back into bed and cover my face w/ my pillow, and go back to sleep. I finally awakened and got into my awakening routine: Made the futon so didn't appear ever slept in, like a dining room couch should appear, Eat Breakfast- some protein containing products and 1 toasted piece of----- w/ extra protein on top...Now am up after just finishing the dishes and having brushed my teeth. Flossing daily is a chore for me. I try and floss at least 3-4 times in a week. Got into my gym outfit to browse the internet and check on my orders. All these lil awakening routines kind of keep me full and not focused on what and when I shall have my lunch. Then I leave for work around 2:45 during days I am scheduled to work. If not scheduled I am still surfing the net for remote CSR, or social services related type of jobs. My new eye lubricant arrived yesterday. It works well on my dry eyes so I may walk in the sun w/o feeling my eyes dry or burning. Been shopping for snack foods lately, on sale from the big holidays. I usually bring the tempting things home and put into the freezer for my housemate....Wish me Energy all, must get to work in 2 hrs.Bye everyone and take care yourselves",healn,"Mon,01/11/2021-12:34pm",Wishing and sending you good,Wishing and sending you good energy for the day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been so long since I have felt part of a community, and recovery has given me the gift of freedom and joy, something I did not have for so, so long. HOWEVER, I have not had my period for the last 5 months.I am currently on a gap year in a foreign country so at first I assumed my body was going through a transition point due to the move; however, after 5 months of being thousands of miles from home, I still don't have my period. I feel like I put so much effort into being healthy. I found exercise I love to do with friends. I eat nutritious and satisfying meals. I sleep as much as I can (certainly not 8 hours every night, but I do my best and rarely get less than 7 hours). I do exercise a lot (I love it and do it with friends so it's social. I am trying to exercise less and eat a bit more, though).I am just really, really stressed about this, and it's ruining my otherwise bright and sunny sky. I long so much to just be healthy and NORMAL. I have battled not getting my period for so long, and I am tired of the fight.

(very involved)in OA (in the city, meetings round the clock everywhere.  Great people but program not helpful long term re: food). Works in AA because people don't have to drink 3 times a day and still stay sober.. I do have a therapist now who specializes in food addiction problems and we ARE getting to the nitty-gritty of things however I know from past experience that when there was an incredible TV on line support group with hundreds of women logging on 24/7,  I was able to manage my eating addiction over a 6 yr. period really well until the TV program and group disbanded. There were women from everywhere. The UK, Australia etc. It was so great. Like in 12 step program meetings people just speak for themselves and others find something that they relate to and take it from there. I've been a counselor for battered women and women going through menopause. It's pretty much the same structure. Nobody saves anybody but because they are all going through very similar situations a person can pickup something someone has said and apply it to themselves. IE: someone here posted they were afraid of a certain food. What I was able to do was relate my own experience with being afraid of eating at times because of where it takes me. Relating to others with similar behaviors helps. But I not only can't restrict any eating, purge, compulsively exorcize or more. So I don't relate to any of this. Support groups really work by identifying and not being alone in what you struggle with. I hope you both have this with other's here who share your experiences and struggles.

She was in the long term care-hospice and I had just inquired about her arm having been so swollen. The nurse in charge mocked me. She took mom's pulse in her arm and retorted back to me in a sassy manner, ""Well she definitely has a pulse!"" She made me feel like I was just imagining her symptom, or over reacting. So having visited mom the night before she died was good and bad experience for me. But I felt like it was some type of unfinished business for me. Had mom existed @ that place any longer,  I would have made a grievance to the BBB, reported this as a potential case of elder hospital care neglect.It took extra long to let this anger go in my mind, but am happy that mom is at peace, and not suffering. I hope you are able to also move on with your most lovely experiences w/ your mother.

289,jennyr44,01-02-21,How to start recovery,"I need help... I obsessed with losing weight for a long time, and lost x lbs when I'm already small, then I got GERD and starting having a ton of stomach pain and acid where everything I ate made me feel sick and I'd throw up A LOT. I knew I couldn't lose any more weight, but the nausea and vomiting made me lose more weight. I gained a little back, but the drs. Never figured out what the nausea and pain was from. I never told anyone about my obsession with losing weight because I didn't mean to lose so much weight, i just got sick and i couldn't figure out why.. now though, I'm on the opposite end... I know that most of what I eat will make me sick and throw up, so for the past year, I have been binging on all the things that I restricted for so long. It's gotten so bad.. to where I'm binging and vomiting at least 4 times every day. I have no idea how no one has noticed, but I don't want to tell anyone. It's embarrassing, and I'm sooo freaking tired and lost and i hate myself for not being able to get over this, and i don't know what to do. I have no one to talk to and i can't afford full-on therapy, and i have no idea where to start.. i used to self-harm and I'm scared I'll start that up again and just add to the frustration and confusion.

ED’s thrive in secrecy, so im sure once you let someone know, they’ll be able to lend you support and help when you feel like purging or self-harming. please try and at least inform a doctor if you can as the health risks that come with an ED are much more terrifying than the embarrassment of telling someone. everyone on this form is here to listen and help, so please don’t hesitate to ask for advice. wishing you the best <3",jennyr44,"Tue,01/05/2021-11:23pm",I don't understand,"I just don't understand why I can't control it, and why it's so hard for me to just not do it.. it makes me so frustrated that it seems to only be getting worse and idk how much of this my body can handle.. this can't be good for me right??

It took me 4 years ofbeing in treatment.  It is not linear.  You will have set backs and lapses.  That's why its so hard doing it without professional help.  We all need professionals to help us also heal the mindset of the eating disorder and deep seated beliefs that need to be changed.  The food is important,  but you will eventually need to face the traumas or the underlying issues behind the eating disorder,  release them, face them and truly move on to be free.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

292,healn,01-02-21,seeking treatment brings up a lot around support,"A few days ago I talked with the one friend that I have confided in that bulimia has been ruling my life for a long time, longer than I have known her, and we have known each other for many years. She is the only friend who when I leave the conversation, I feel supported and relaxed rather than stressed and ashamed. I also do not feel I have to explain myself or have to take care of how they feel or minimize what I go through. Up until now I had no idea what a gift this is. I am trying to focus on this support and take it in. At the same time, as I get even a bit of the support I actually need, it brings out that grief. Do you ever have that happen? That loss. That break down in tears loss. That my mom when I was a teen and told her about bulimia, her response was do it on my own and clean up the bathroom. I felt scared. Shamed. Rejected. Unsupported. Faulted. It caused damage that fed into bulimia.After a lot of therapy, I came to understand that my parents suffered from an abusive relationship where I was collateral damage. Bulimia was a way I survived the abusive home life. When I feel steady, I know they were in a cycle of abuse with no support to break through it. So it is unsurprising they could not support me. But I never processed this childhood moment around bulimia because I hid it from therapists. I told my friend this happened. Her response was I am sorry that happened. I bawled, then felt - lighter.What's that saying: once you get what you need, you feel the difference support can make, yet you also grief not getting what you needed all along. I just signed up for a virtual support group to see if I can get extra support to take the next step in finding a therapist. For now just saying all this.",stinkmystery,"Sat,01/02/2021-7:19pm",Thank you for sharing,"Healn, thank you for sharing and congratulations on your journey so far!As I read about the wonderful support you received and the grief that it can bring out, it reminds me of my friend and her experience.Can you maybe expand a little more on what it is about your friend's support that is different?  What is it that makes you feel supported and relaxed rather than stressed and ashamed...while also not feel like you have to explain yourself or have to take care of how they feel or minimize what you go through?If you have time and feel like sharing, that would be immensely appreciated by me and I'm sure others who have friends or partners with ED.Best of luck with your journey to recovery!

294,vvrainbow12,12-02-20,Haven't had anorexia long enough?,"Hey everyone, I am very new to the NEDA community, and I have been diagnosed with anorexia. I haven't had anorexia very long actually; I've had it for about 2 months before my parents caught on. I never went a few days without food, but I often fasted on the days I went to school (hybrid learning because of covid-19), in which I ate breakfast, and then skipped lunch, didn't have a snack, and exercised before dinner. I always ate, but very low caloric amounts with exercise. Because my parents are deeply involved in the medical community as doctors, they caught on after 2 months, and I was forced to ""gain weight"". Nothing was working, and I wasn't ready to recover. It wasn't until November when things became serious. I have lost more weight between the time I was first discovered with anorexia, until the beginning of November. My blood pressure was low, my heart was low, and I was very consumed with thoughts of food. I already had pre-existing disordered thoughts, such as anxiety and depression, so being diagnosed made everything 10 times worse. I feel invalidated as a person suffering from anorexia because I was discovered extremely early on in my disorder. I don't know how to feel, and I am in recovery in outpatient care in my own home. My meal routine consists of 3 regular meals, and one snack. I feel disgusted in everything I do, and I am more afraid of eating and food than I was before I was diagnosed. what's worse is that I'm not allowed to exercise and I feel that my parents lost their faith in me.

I really don’t have anything in my life that I enjoy. My psychiatrist gave me her cell phone number. I feel like texting her but I hate to bother her.

I responded (like you?) ""I am fearful about my life""...but out there"". The therapist said that sounded ungrateful. But I wasn't, and said so.

I wonder if I am ""normal"" just the way I am. I wonder if I am ""normalizing"" my disordered eating.
I do hate my eating disorder but I just do not see it coming to an end.It is true, I am ""functional"" and ""under control"".  I can be perceived as ""normal"" by people and I almost exhibit ""normal"" behaviours to others' eyes.

Although I have not relapsed, I have felt pretty bad inside. I really want a 100% recovered life. I do not want to have to control anything of that I do with food and exercise. However, I have started seeing that in ""real life"", normal people watch out for what they eat and sometimes restrict some types of foods just to keep themselves at a healthy weight. They do not have an ED but i do hate the fact of them having to ""watch out"" for what they eat...
I am trying to discover if ""100% freedom"" is possible. I just would not like to be a person who does not mind about her weight or her health. But taking care of both things implies to ""watch out"" for some things...
Sorry that i am rambling here... I am half asleep but thinking of this...",2Healthy4me,"Tue,12/22/2020-6:22pm",Blessed Wishes to You and Your Health ,"I can relate to the first part of your experience. My anxiety controls what I allow myself to do on daily basis, not the ED itself. I.e, in eating at restaurant , I realize many employees are not paid well enough to even afford a shower when they arrive back to a SRO shelter or a home of many people and its not always easy for them to just take a shower, or luxury bath w/ all the works like lovely scented candles, bath crystals, and to just relax after work. Then I worry how clean the food is that's being handled by these poor people who usually are the 1's who need to earn money the most, and yet seem to be the most underpaid group of people serving the public.Usually I would rather stay home in my doll house of a studio and make my own daily meals and never dine out, or pay for food to be served to me by these poor underpaid workers...Its a vicious circle of anxiety just going out the front door, then guilt and avoidance in purchasing food from fast food places. My ED is probably part 3 in this cycle preventing me from supporting fast food sales. Now w/ the CV-19,  I feel like I was actually correct in my thinking about purchasing food made by public food staff,   for the public consumer...So just going outside during these times is causing even more anxiety in my former outdoor pleasures such as window shopping, browsing out of boredom, hitting all the mall store sales, etc.This all reinforces my anxiety over even shopping for food to eat at home...Thus, I can sort of relate to your post on what is ""Normal"" or ""Not Normal"" w/ people experiencing ED's.....Have a Blessed Holiday, if you celebrate holidays,  and just take 1 day @ a time. You're ok.  we all are ok...",trying_to_lose_88,"Tue,12/29/2020-7:06pm","What is ""normal"" eating?","I've struggled with trying to be ""normal"", too, especially with food. With me, it's either too much or not enough. I never know when enough is enough. I've binged one day, and restricted the next. So what is ""normal?"" It must be a state of balance between the two extremes. But like lots of things, this is easier said than put into practice. That's my two cents, anyway.

Please go to the ER.  They can at least check vitals, run blood work, get you somewhat better.  I have collapsed when I was worse in my eating disorder.  I was worse than I thought.  Maybe you can go to the ER and then send a text to the person you trust the most saying where you are.   You are cared about.   This was a warning sign you are in trouble in your health.  Your loved ones will want to be there the best they can.  They will feel better you are getting help and can go from there.  They would be more worried and filled with guilt if you didn't get help after it was too late.  Eating disorders will destroy you if not dealt with.  You don't have to face this alone.  With texting,  you can communicate the words you can't say.

I remember I was terrified to tell my mom when I had to be hospitalized for suicidal plans 5 times this year, but it felt SO much better after letting her know.

I hope if the doctor won't help, you'll still seek out help until you get it.  It's a long hard road.  I struggled for 30 years with eating disorders.   My mom never got me help, so I've spent the past 4 years in treatment (inpatient,  residential, php, iop and outpatient)facilities.  I have relapsed over the past 4 years.  Know the journey to recovery won't happen overnight.  It won't be easy.  It will involve possibly a lot of anger, definitely a lot of emotions,  a lot of energy and tears.  But freedom is so worth it.  I am grateful I found treatment and healing.  Now I am working on the traumas that led to my eating disorders.

Have you thought about finding a therapist to talk to about your thoughts and feelings about food and stuff? I highly recommend that you do. If you’re not sure where to start looking, I’m pretty sure the NEDA helpline can assist you with finding treatment options in your area. Be proud of yourself for choosing recovery!

302,CASACERA,12/24/2020,I overate and made myself stuffed,"and so uncomfortable. Never think it's going to happen. Plan, plan, plan. Do all the positive, healthy things I can. A good therapist, but that's twice a week for an hour. What do I the food addict do for the rest of the time when not doing all  the positive and yes fulfilling things folks do and talk about here and elsewhere. I need a phone number  and or website link I can go to in those seconds before I even prepare, or start to eat or so-to-=speak finish a meal (whatever that is these days). Covid has made this so much worse . Trapped in my home where my food terrorist lives. Used to go places when it was this serious. Residential weight management resorts, hotels or hospitals. But if I had a 24/7 of this support with others who walk the walk I'd be able to ""keep my head above water"". My dear husband knows it all, wants to help but although he too loves food doesn't have my condition/affliction/problem addiction. (p.s. been diagnosed with this). The fact that obesity is the 2nd major risk factor with Covid, that in itself should mean something.

Although I have had some young therapists or some that have been a 3-4 years older than me, I think what really matters is: a) Preparation and b) If they are a good fit for you.If you do not feel comfortable with someone younger than you, better try to find someone else. Actually, my phychiatrist is younger than me. Things did not work for us in the therapy field (she also does therapy). So, I had to find a therapist and just to keep this lady as my phychiatrist.
What used to bother me sometimes was her lack of experience understanding my eating disorder and that I had some facilitation skills already developed. That caused that I noticed her being quite ""green"" when treating me. I am not a phychologist but have some training in that space. So, the simple fact of noticing her making several mistakes caused the lost of my trust in her treatment. That did not happen in the medical space. She is a good doctor. So, she continues to be my phychiastrist.I have heard of some therapists suggesting to ask ourselves why it is so important the person we work with to be older. Regardless of your reasons, I perfectly understand that young people needs the opportunity to get experience and by being an architect in the IT field, I have faced that situation with my ""older"" clients. Some of them have recognized I am well prepared and have had a wonderful experience with me whilst others have just not given me that opportunity.Do what your heart asks you to do...

 for your health was oh so good
 I never thought that medicine
 would not live up to what it should
 I never thought it all those days
 when you fought so just to live
 How could I know what I know now
 the lesson of your life would give?
 We think we have it figured out
 not all the way, but most
 We work and save and plan and learn
 hoping life will be a host
 of joy and love if possible
 and  when it's there we hold on tight
 why not? there's so much struggle
 we savor any sweet delight
 but I'm on the train reflecting now
 and I here you softly call me dear

309,healn,12/19/2020,feeling overwhelmed by seeking help,"has anyone else found it totally overwhelming to seek help? i find it to be really hard. in the past few days i have tried to seek a therapist or a treatment program specifically for recovery from bulimia for the first time ever. the cost is giving me more anxiety which is triggering me. we should have a health care system where such care is covered and it's not. and i am an adult, which i can't imagine being a young person who has a guardian how much of a challenge it can be to get the help you need. it is even harder when a program has an approach that feels right but is the most expensive and unaffordable. so many of us are unemployed due to the pandemic so it makes it even more difficult to start recovery with who you need. then it takes time. time to look and apply for financial aid. time to do intake. i don't have a support system that is helping to do that for me. i have always managed things on my own but this is very hard to manage on my own. i even feel guilt or shame around expressing that feeling as though i am complaining about having to do any of this or that i should change my attitude because it is me investing in my recovery. while there is truth in that, there is also a reality that one has to overcome these access obstacles just to get help. i am expressing my feelings about this otherwise it just bottles up into yet another trigger, and i am trying not to go down that road. i am trying to recognize that this is hard and time consuming and a bit defeating and in fact women's health care should have this and should create access especially for needs that have a stigma or shame attached to it. now i am on the search and already feeling tired but trying to keep going.",2Healthy4me,"Sun,12/20/2020-4:56pm",Try an online Addiction Recovery Program 4 Now...,"I was a member of OA for a year or so.

I needed inpatient but our finances did not allow it. So, I always got outpatient treatment.
Maybe besides the online groups, you could benefit from some outpatient therapy in the meantime.

I was talking about outpatient therapy that is often out of network and not covered by insurance. That is what is unaffordable for many including myself at this time.I understand why you have given advice to gap fill with other options. For many this makes sense. I am going to keep looking for the whole rather than part of what I need, even in the short-run, because for me, recovery is as much about the treatment from any outside resources as the belief in myself and the power I feel when I say here are all of my needs, rather than renegotiate them down too early in order to get anything met. I have no doubt others have their own experience and may approach it in their own way. This for me is an important part of owning my healing.

I also heard back from the other clinic that takes medicaid that they are so backed up that the soonest I can do an intake is January and the earliest I can see a therapist is in 3 to 4 months afterwards. They told me they are inundated. I have a financial aid application filled out except it has to wait to be submitted because it requires the therapists and treatment programs. There are two therapists in private practice that might work. I talk with one this week and the other has not gotten back to me yet. Both are on a sliding fee and beyond what I can afford so it would require me to get financial aid which I would not find out about until spring if I get the funds or not. I think I'll try to start with the clinic program that is open now and then if it does not fit, later on, switch to the other clinic, if they have an opening, or one of the therapists in private practice, if I get the financial aid.I am truly writing this for myself because I find this process to be tedious, exhausting and frankly, making me not want to get help for recovery and just spare myself the stress of navigating the system.

It used to be that nighttime was worse, and it still is, but it has become an even stronger pull around the clock from the moment I wake up to when I fall asleep, if I fall asleep. I've gone to therapy for a solid two decades, going through grief and trauma healing; I'm constantly recommitting each day to take care of my body without restricting, without overly exercising, without binging and purging. I think this is the first time in my life I've started to say this is addiction and depression at work and no matter how much I reconcile my past trauma or cultivate habits good for my life, I have to get more help than do it alone because this is taking me over. If I really allow myself to feel the way I really feel, I feel angry. I have been telling myself that it's me who made bulimia in my life. Somehow blaming myself for it made it more easy to say I can change it as though I have total control. But part of me really feels addition and depression found its way into my life and body and I have to recover from it. I'm confused by how I even start this path of recovering. I notice how reluctant I am too, flailing in a kiddie pool, even with floaters on. Right now, all I know is writing here is helping me rather than hiding or pretending or stuffing down my thoughts and feelings.

But I am so proud that you are still trying, still reaching out to people- ringing the hotline while you feel particularly low is a brilliant idea.
It sounds like you’re struggling a lot with the question of “why” you’re suffering so much? It’s such a hard question to be stuck mulling over as it is likely to bring up some of the very worst memories and thoughts you have. No matter what has happened in your life you are NOT to blame for being ill and you will ALWAYS deserve recovery. Do you think you could try and shift any of your thoughts away from asking why you are ill to how you can recover? Often we think we need the answer to why before we take steps towards recovery but that isn’t necessarily true. Building up a strong support network and identifying your own unhelpful habits can be key steps anyone can take even if they don’t know why exactly they are suffering. You do not deserve for things to be so hard. You have every right to feel angry or whatever emotions you are feeling right now!! Let yourself feel them. But you can’t solve anything by doing just the thinking And feeling  alone - you need to take action (easier said than done when you’re so exhausted). It can be small steps to start with but I believe you can do it.

It is helpful when someone out there responds to your comment. I feel a lot less alone in my struggle toward recovery. What you shared made me reflect on a few things, which I think will be helpful for me to take steps forward: I never really talked about bulimia until now. I never talked about or expressed how angry I felt about having to go through this fight for my life. I always sort of just resigned to the fact that this was the hand I was dealt after years of family trauma and tried to recover. But I noticed that I have to express how angry I feel because when I don't, it gets bottled up and can trigger an episode. But what you are also encouraging me to do I want to remember, which is that I don't want to live there. I don't want to get stuck there. I don't want the pain to be all I feel. That won't help my recovery.I have been trying to recover all on my own without any group or therapist or check in buddy or plan. I just each day wake up trying not to binge and purge and trying to write to help me process how I feel, trying to talk about it rather than hide with a confidant, and trying to support my self-worth, lower my anxiety, and strengthen my body without harm.

I'm just going to keep posting on the same thread for now because I need this space to help me along. I've spent the past week (again) researching therapists and treatment programs, talking to NEDA, looking at websites, sending free consult emails to about several therapists. I feel exhausted and defeated. The number of therapists who accept medicaid is zero so far. How is anyone supposed to afford treatment? This system is harmful in and of itself. One therapist name I got from NEDA who was supposedly taking medicaid asked me what is bulimia. I was like this is not going to work. The sliding fee scale is also cost-prohibitive for me. So I spent two days writing a financial aid application, but in order for me to submit it, I have to put down the names of therapists or a treatment program that I plan to attend, but to do that I have to pay upfront for intake or at least one session to get a treatment plan. Plus I won't know if I get aid for six months.While I know I can get a full time job again, it will take time. So I do not have the means to pay for a treatment plan or therapist after all this shopping. I feel forced to delay my recovery, which I urgently do not want to do. I feel I am in terrible hazing ritual like ""you have to want it bad or ""invest in your recovery"", which is just code for ""go into debt"" or ""pay out of pocket"". I was told by a program with an expensive intake fee that I can go to one of their free support groups, which they said earlier is not in lieu of treatment. What's free is basically less of what you actually need for recovery. My goal is full recovery, not partial.My stress about where the money is going to come from turns to eating when I have to be focused on a job search not spending all my time and energy on this step. I have talked to the helpline twice, which helped, but is not going to do the work for me. My friend who is a support is unavailable right now but I will try to talk to them when they are. Somehow I feel guilty like I am ""supposed to reframe my frustration"" or ""handle this better"", but I want to scream. I know I am resilient and am going to find a way. But I call bullshit on the message that this way is somehow a part of the recovery journey. It's not. It's uneven access. I can't imagine being a young woman with a guardian who may not support them and does not have means. So I have to write here. I have to name my experience.

I’ve been in recovery from AN and BED for 2 years now.I have had a relapse two months ago (was weighed at my doctors appointment and told to lose weight).I’m in a larger body which has contributed to me not being taken seriously when addressing that I have an ED. I have also recently moved and changed my therapist. Unfortunately she has encouraged me to lose weight and exercise vigorously, and keeps pushing me about it. I don’t really resonate with her to be honest. She keeps talking about how I need to lose weight and is in my opinion pushing diet culture.

317,Stass_11,12-11-20,Struggling ,"I’ve been struggling with an Ed for months now. It first began with over restricting. I’ve noticed how skinny i’ve become but no one really called me out on it until i went to dinner at my grandparents one day. Hearing them asking me outloud if i was struggling with an ed opened my eyes which now led to a downward spiral. I’ve gone from over restricting to over indulging. It’s been probably over a month now where i’ve been overeating and can’t seem to stop. When I start with the binging it doesn’t bother me, it’s like my brain doesn’t register what’s happening at the time. It’s at night before i go to bed when i realize how much i ate when i start to hate myself and cry. I haven’t talked about this with my family or anyone for that matter since i’m so used to keeping my problems to myself.",koda_123,"Fri,12/18/2020-8:53pm",hi,"Hey, I'm really sorry that you're going through this. I totally understand what you mean when you say that you haven't spoken to your family or anybody- I'm in a similar boat. I know it's so freaking hard to get through the day sometimes, and I TOTALLY understand how awful you feel at night.
I used to get those feelings every single night, and it felt like they totally overwhelmed my brain. Within the last few months, I haven't been experiencing that as often as before, and while I'm not sure if this is what specifically helped me I'll give you the info and maybe it will help.
I would try to match when I'm eating to when my family or friends were eating. With COVID I would eat breakfast at the same time as my parents, lunch at the same time as my brothers, and then match dinner with one of them again. I did this every day and it helped me to better understand when I am supposed to eat/feel hungry.
I tend to be more restrictive than binging, but the one thing they have in common is wonky hunger cues (or at least I assume so). So maybe if you matched your mealtimes with someone close to you that might help with your negative feelings at night?
something else that has helped me was actually a tip I found online somewhere. I eat the majority of my food with chopsticks or with a show playing. By changing the focus of mealtime I feel like I don't obsess over what or how much I am eating. The chopsticks probably sound a little funny but I only just started using them a year ago, so it's like a distraction from the action of eating- instead I'm trying to use these new utensils. Again, this might not work for you, but it helped me at least a little bit.
I hope you feel better and just know that there is a community of people who love and support you :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The way you feel reminds me of ways I used to feel about food when I was struggling with my own eating disorder. And while we can't diagnose anything on the forums, it seems like maybe you already suspect that something is not ""normal"" with the way you feel about food. Mr. Rogers used to say, ""If it's mentionable, it's manageable."" Do you have someone you trust to talk to about this stuff? I have struggled with disordered eating and depression in my life and my recovery wouldn't have been possible without supportive listeners. We're always here to listen on the forums, too. <3, STP",Depressedkid_1,"Tue,12/15/2020-6:13pm","SmashThePatriarchy,",Thanks for your comment.

Before I was discovered and dignosed with anorexia, I felt as if I was the only one who was going to gain weight if I ate normally, and if I kept eating in a diet mindset, I would be able to maintain my weight. However, I know that it isn't true, and that no matter how much your ed wants you to think it is, the reality is is that you aren't that different from anybody else; you aren't going to gain weight from eating what your body needs to nourish itself. And as for you being a normal weight, it is actually extremly common for anorexics to feel as if they are not worthy of having an eating disorder because they are of a normal weight or are slightly underweight. An eating disorder is a mental disorder that is categorized by the harmful thoughts and feelings that you protray on your body. Just because you are a certain weight does not mean that you are not suffering. Please remeber that you are worthy of recovery, and that you need food no matter what you look like or feel like. It will be tough for the first few days, and you may be tempted to skip meals and fast, but I promise that eating will make you heathier, I promise!

It’s also so impressive that you have recognised that you have a problem and need to do something about it.
I would ask you to really consider why it is that you don’t want your mums knowing? It is not okay to expect a child to recover from a serious mental disorder on their own- you should not place that burden on yourself. You deserve help. Often people are uncomfortable with sharing their illness with people close to them because they may be embarrassed or are scared that their loved ones will “interfere”.
In reality loved ones often want the best for their children and that might mean telling the relevant people at school but does not mean telling everyone or making you feel completely exposed. It is super scary to let your parents in but for me it was the first step towards getting the care and support I needed. It will likely feel uncomfortable and won’t always be easy. Recovery is not easy and ED voices will always find ways and “reasons” to stop you from reaching out to people who can help. It’s time to stop listening to these voices. If you want to understand what is going on then you need to start seeing your health and happiness as a big deal even when you don’t want to. It isn’t easy and it isn’t the answer you want to hear but telling trusted people in your life that you are struggling is so important. You can do this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am so sorry it’s hard for you at the moment.
Hunger is such a difficult thing to understand- I don’t think we ever can really! Our bodies are too complex to really get why on some days we might need more energy than others. Because that’s all food is- energy and nutrients.
I am worried when you are saying that you are eating too much food that you have an awful lot of judgement towards yourself and food. You are valuable and good no matter what you eat and in what quantities. Some people have suggested that the desire/compulsion to eat “large” amounts of food actually comes from restriction of food at other times. Your body gets scared that there is a lack of resources so is super smart and tries to encourage you to eat more. Do you think this applies to you at all? Are you restricting (even at really low levels e.g. by telling yourself you can only have certain foods at certain times of the day etc) ?
I know it can feel impossible going through it but “bingeing” is not the enemy. Your body is not the enemy. I would suggest you try and reconnect with your hunger and any tiny possible restrictions you enact during the day as the first step to understanding your “binges”. Of course not everyone has the same experiences but I know for me that was a key step. I hope you’re able to see that you are not alone, you are doing so so well by reaching out. It can feel like an impossible situation but you’re still trying, please show yourself some extra kindness for that.

I was just saying how i feel and now she won't even talk to me and when she does she just yells at me about throwing her under the bus. How do i make things better? I feel like i keep letting her down,RitaSB,"Sat,12/12/2020-6:27pm",Hang in there ,"Hi, I’m so sorry things sound so hard for you at the moment. Feeling alone at this time of massive stress around what is “right” to eat must be really overwhelming. Firstly I am really proud that you have seen doctors, are expressing how you’re feeling and trying to find a way to a happier relationship with food. These are all big things and you deserve to be told that you are taking really important brave steps.
In response to your question about not being able to read your hunger- that is completely normal. It is not you failing or letting anyone down!! Hunger can be massively variable, show up in physical or mental forms and generally be very confusing- especially if you have a history of restriction. The hard part is that often when you don’t know if you’re hungry, and you’re asking yourself that question, it means you are mentally hungry and your brain is trying to tell you to eat. I say this is the hard part because it can be distressing to feel like you are hungrier than a “normal person”. EDs thrive on rules structure and a presence that there is control. When you worry that food is too much food can you question why you think any amount of food would be too much? When your body has been in energy deficit you have a lot of repair woke internally to do and that requires food. Often the judgement of “too much” stems from a fear of weight gain. This is totally understandable but not something you can give in to and recover from a restrictive eating disorder. Your body is smart. It might feel crazy rn but things will settle it takes a lot of time, trust and sitting through these uncomfortable feelings. In the meantime can I suggest you check out Tabitha Farrars posts about hunger and the fear of weight gain- she explains it very clearly and gives useful techniques to deal with both. By doing this and continuing to eat you are making massive steps forward which is something any family member should be proud of. You can do this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
328,burrose3,12-11-20,Not sure If I need Help,"Hi,I've been struggling with food lately, I think I may have an eating disorder but I am not sure. I didn't come to the realization until my friend opened up about their ed. I realized that since I was 12 I have never had more than 1 meal a day, I am now almost 18. About a year ago I got a job at a fast food restaurant and the staff literally forced me to eat, so I did. However, on my own I would never have chosen to eat or even realized I was hunger. At that time it did not have anything to do with looks or anything. However, once I noticed that I was loosing weight, I started to count my calories so I could reach my calorie intake goal for someone my age. But once I started that, I felt like I could't stop. I became fixated on how many calories were going into my body. I soon started to limit my calories on purpose because I did not like the feeling of a full stomach. That was almost 2 months ago, I didn't think I was losing any weight until my dad made a comment asking if I was even eating food. I responded of course I'm eating food. Since then it hasn't even been brought up. About two days ago I decided I was going to eat more. And today I hit my calorie goal intake! I guess my question is, if I have a complicated relationship with food, could I recover by myself? Or is this just one thing that I need to ask help for in order to truly recover?",RitaSB,"Sat,12/12/2020-6:12pm",First thing to say is I’m,"First thing to say is I’m really proud- getting to the point of realising you have a difficult/disordered relationship with food and wondering what to do about it is a really important step. There is no one way to “truly recover” but from my own, and reading others’, experience telling other people that you are struggling is key. Different people need different support systems and that’s absolutely normal and okay and does not make your disordered eating any more or less real. You shouldn’t have to do this alone. Recovery is hard work and you deserve there to be people who are trying to be there for you through it on the days when you’re not feeling so committed/strong. It is too easy to feel like you can do it alone and don’t want to “make a fuss” out of embarrassment or the isolating thoughts that often come along with EDs. Eating disorders thrive in secrecy. You deserve help. Regardless of where your weight is at, how well you think you could do alone, whether you’re meeting your calorie goals: you still deserve help. Please speak to someone in your life you feel you can trust and work from there.

I've also started babysitting a kid who pretty much stuffs me with food and thanks to him I'm eating a little more and my singing is really helping with my confidence because everyone who sees me loves me.

Hope y'all are doing well",2Healthy4me,"Tue,12/08/2020-3:57pm",That Sounds GREAT,"Keep up the good work. It can only get better and being healthy sure beats feeling ill all the time.

334,Annet,12-06-20,Back to square 1 again...,"I reached a goal that is pretty close to my target weight, my clothes started to not fit in and guess what? I fought against the urges to restrict for 3 weeks but could not be successful.
I have already gotten rid of that weight and I am again able to fit in my ""unhealthy"" clothes.
On the one hand, I feel a great sense of accomplishment. On the other one, I feel like crap.
I have not lost a huge amount of weight but it really bothers me that I self-sabotage myself every time I am getting close to my target weight. I just can not keep it. I start panicking and then, I start engaging in behaviours.I feel bad because my therapist was working hard with me on trying to avoid this to happen. But here I am, failing again. I really wonder if I want to look and FEEL WELL or if I am only interested in looking well (that it is not looking well, to be honest).I often ask myself if I really want recovery. I also ask myself why I just can not tolerate to be in a healthy weight. I wonder what is wrong with me if I already have a lot of health conditions caused by my ED.I am so tired of all of this....",CASACERA,"Tue,12/08/2020-10:59am",dear Annet,"It's ironic. We are on the same page but on opposite sides of the issue. How strange for me to wish I had some of your restricting power. But I think the real difference is that I love food and the whole process of eating so much and that it puts me in a most pleasurable state. But like you, ""not in control"". Imagine, we both ""want to be in control"". Are there any foods that you love? What about preparing and eating them? I make a conscious effort to eat more slowly, to pay attention and take small bites, to really savor the food, but my mind wanders ahead as to what I'll be eating next etc. and there was always a sense that it will be taken away. I'm very aware of how ravenous I am but I have compassion for myself because I've done and tried everything that's out there (and even ""in"" there) as in hospitals etc. Maybe we could learn something from each other. I've been gaining weight , too, but I want to get back to feeling more healthy and comfortable in my body. My issue has never had much to do with appearance, because when comfortable weightwise I don't care about it. Bless-ed moments of not thinking about it and feeling attractive. Just to feel free. Like I do when I'm riding my 3 speed Raleigh sports bike. Missed it so much this past yr. Warm weather rider from May thru Oct. I'm so at home on the bike. Don't think of it as ""exercise"" but an incredible way of just getting around. We don't own a car, don't need it here on the island. My walking on hard pavement is ltd. so that makes riding even better. Hugs, CC",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How am I supposed to tell my best friend when i don't even understand it myself?,Annet,"Sat,12/05/2020-11:30pm","HI Depressed kid,","Giving a name to your ED is useless. At the end, it is a mental illness that causes a lot of damage to your physical and emotional health. There are different criteria professionals use to diagnose us. You could be diagnosed either with purgative-anorexia or even with OSFED depending on your personal situation and behaviors. So, do not try to put a name to your problem. Instead, try to find some help. You do not need to give your friends details of your behaviours. They know you are struggling. But you could benefit from asking them or your parents to help you get a doctor's appointment either with a MD who could refer you to a phychiatrist or/and a therapist.If you are student, check for any counselling services available within your institution. That could be a good way to start.As I told you in an earlier message, once you start purging it is very difficult to stop BUT not impossible. You just started. It is the perfect time to avoid suffering and damaging yourself a lot. Hugs

But yes, my binge eating disorder is an emergency. 2nd risk factor with Covid is obesity. I'm an overeater, a food addict and because of the isolation this terrible virus imposes, I'm in a depressive state which is only natural. But fighting the destructive overeating compulsion requires a human contact via at least telephone. I have a therapist who I will be speaking with on Thursday. But my addiction pressure is 24/7. And when particularly vulnerable and need that immediate connection not to succumb to the ravenous food appetite behavior that plagues me. So terrible, painful physically stuffed and gradually gaining weight. Seeing the TV images of the unfortunate people who have passed away worries me.

Have you tried journaling, busying yourself while feeling out of control before a binge occuyrs. I feel bad that the crisis line had only a message machine there for you. There are many other crisis lines out there. I would recommend that you do a bit of research to find phone #'s and chat lines for your future feelings of being in a crisis. Do you have a med Dr who you see about this problem already. If not I would recommend an appointment w/ your MD, more specifically, if possible see someone in the behavioral health dept that your med coverage plan refers you too. I do hope you have med insurance for yourself. This is the time of the year that medical coverage is open for Enrollment. Do some online research to see which plan you would benefit from most. If under a husbands plan or parents plan then just schedule an appointment, even an online appointment works well for behavioral and other non suicidal issues. If you feel like hurting yourself please do transport yourself to the closest ER or the ER of your choice. They will know what to do.

I don't know if I am gonna be able to handle it in recover and i was wondering if I'm just being stupid or if it's normal to feel horrible when gaining weight in recovery.,taesongs,"Fri,11/27/2020-6:26pm",you're not alone!,"hi! you're definitely not being stupid, i've felt/continue to feel the same way. i was ""recovered"" before quarantine, and i've relapsed twice since then. whenever i try to get better, i feel terrified of weight gain and immediately want to quit. so no, you're not being stupid at all.BUT what's important to remember is that:
1) weight is not a determiner of health or worth
2) weight fluctuates constantly for so many reasons, we can't possibly take them all into account
3) weight gain during recovery is completely normal and is usually a good thing, our bodies want to be at a healthy weight and sometimes it means gaining a few. it's perfectly okay.we just need to listen to our bodies - it'll know if it's hungry, full, or if something is really wrong. don't feel bad for gaining weight if you've been doing all the right steps, it's just a part of the process. i know it's not easy, but i'm literally right there with you. we can get through this!",Depressedkid_1,"Fri,11/27/2020-8:33pm",Thank you taesongs,"Thank you, I didn't know if anyone would reply.

Eating disorders always convince us that we are the exception. We can be objectively aware that eating a minimal amount of food isn't enough to healthily sustain a person's body and that exercising until we can barely walk from exhaustion and pain is not wise, but ED can also convince us that ""No, I think I've messed up my metabolism, I need to undereat"" or no matter what, ""it's different in my situation"" or ""it's not really that bad for me"" despite us showing all of the typical behaviors of our ED. I am sorry that this method of thinking is making it difficult to help yourself get better. Please don't let your ED convince you that you need to get sicker to prove to yourself or others that you deserve treatment. Dangers of ED can happen unexpectedly before any clear warn9ing on blood tests, so it is not something to play chicken with.

351,healn,11/25/2020,what team i need,"Last night I dreamt of a few situations with people in my real life where I felt unseen, unheard, abandoned and ultimately, unloved. I felt resentful, betrayed, by them, after having cared for and loved them as much as I could. It feels very true that my dreams were putting a finger on the very real emotional wounds and pains I feel that feed into my depression and addiction, and tug at me to give my body over to bulimia every day. I feel my self-worth is very much tied up into making others happy only to never quite receive the love and care I need from others, and accept that I am only here to give and my turn often does not come. I read about compulsive caretakers who as kids took on adult care taking roles out of abuse or necessity, and it was a very helpful frame for me to understand the road I've been on. This is the fight of my life! I'm a little lost as to what I need in a team to help support me in working toward recovery. Do I get a psychologist who specializes in eating disorders and specifically in bulimia, is there a support group I use, do I do both, is there a spiritual coach who can help me regain my stability and strength. Do I get a nutritionist? I figure the answer to my questions are all yes. And on state insurance. Is anyone else finding it incredibly difficult to navigate health coverage for recovery related to ED's? I have one friend who I confide in, and actually told, I'm writing on this forum, and supports me in recovery. Clearly, me trying to do this myself is a start but it's not what my recovery needs me to do. I need more. I honestly got to a point where maybe letting it all go would be relieving. How do I start...again?",Annet,"Wed,11/25/2020-10:12pm","Hi healn,","Welcome to the forums! I think you could benefit from calling the NEDA helpline so they provide you with more information about resources, treatment options and insurance companies.If you have an eating disorder, for sure your team may need to have a phychologist, a phychiatrist and a dietician. But each person and each ED recovery journey is different.I would say start with one of them. Preferably a therapist or a phychiatrist. They will help you build your team.On the other hand, there are people who finds spiritual coaches pretty helpful. Again, it depends on you and your personality. The important is to surround yourself with people who supports you with your recovery process and if they are trained professionals in the field, that is better.Hugs

352,Octopie,11/24/2020,Major ED Relapse,"Hi everyone I'm posting because Ive been keeping all this inside, and I just want to get it off my chest. TW!!!
A few years ago I lost weight through diet and exercise, right at the end it started to become unhealthy, with major restriction and binging (and purging). I knew it was too much so I stopped counting calories and just tried to eat healthy/ maintain exercise, which helped. I also went through therapy and intuitive eating, aiming to underpin the cause of my fear of weight gain (low self esteem, among other things).
Earlier this year, due to a hectic schedule I stopped being able to exercise and lost my progress, I haven't been able since to regain it. I also began comfort eating again but my problems only really restarted in the past month, when I moved back to live with my parents. My dad constantly buys chips, chocolate, popcorn, cheese and brings home different pastries and things to eat. I do treat myself to them, but I never have them lying around the house because I know it will make me binge and overeat. And I have been, in just the past few weeks I've gained almost 10lbs and the weight gain has made me start to purge. I am terrified of being ""fat"" and will ask anyone multiple times a day if I look different. I can feel myself very rapidly getting worse, sometimes purging multiple times per day.
My face is so swollen and disgusting, I can feel a double chin. I feel hyper aware of all the fat in my body and have only been wearing super loose clothes and still I'll randomly pinch and grab at my fat. I'll start a new day and plan to get back on track but have no motivation to exercise, or if I do I'll be constantly aware of the jiggle of my fat and my rolls. Even if I start the day off with a healthy meal, it won't be long till I binge on cake or chips etc. I feel disgusting. I have a boyfriend and I'm terrified of him seeing me. I want to break up with him because he deserves so much better. I haven't told him about the extent of what is going on with me because I'm terrified he will see the real me and want a break up.
Friends and family are quite active and have better self control than me, I feel so threatened and everytime I open social media and see ""weight loss"", it triggers the desire to purge in my brain. I am struggling more than I ever have, I currently am unable to go to therapy and honestly am just seeking any help at all. Writing this all out has also been quite therapeutic, so thank you for reading.",Annet,"Wed,11/25/2020-10:03pm","Hi Octopie,","It sounds to me as if there were any triggers at home or from being around with your family. Have you already identified them? I know there is a lot of food in your environment but still, I think there is something else than that. How is the family dynamics? How is your relationship with your parents and siblings? How do you feel being at home?Over time, I have had many relapses. But at some point in my life, every time I was going to my parents and staying there during the weekends/holidays, I used to engage on behaviours.I am glad you came here to vent. I want you to know that you are not alone. We all understand what you are going through.If you are already over-eating and purging, start by trying to postpone the urges to purge. First by 5 minutes, then, 10 and so on. Same with the binging. Sometimes, postponing the urges helps to get rid of them.Also, when you feel like over-eating or purging, go out for a walk. You will see how relaxing that is.Please do not judge yourself for your physical appearance. Your boyfriend and everyone around you loves you for who you are not for how you look like. Would you stop loving your boyfriend just because he puts on some weight? See, I do not know your weight or how you look like and still I see a wonderful soul behind your writing.Keep working on recovery. You deserve to be well.Hugs

Anxiety and emotional pain can be caused due to many reasons but the common thing is that we injure ourselves as if we deserved it.
You do not deserve this. Your body does not deserve this.
I know sometimes we prefer to injure ourselves rather than thinking on our past issues or letting others cause us some pain. BUT, we are also only the ones that can nurture ourselves and treat our body fairly and well.
Think of your body as a sacred temple. That is your earth-home. I know it has been damaged by other people BUT now, it is your time to re-built that temple, to nurture it and help it to heal.
You are worth the effort. Keep working with your therapist and come here when you need to vent or tell others how you feel.Hugs

CC",Annet,"Tue,11/24/2020-11:34pm","Hi Casacera,","I do love working out, running in particular. In the past, I used to participate in the national competitions. So, I got so much used to train for long hours and to get joy by doing so.
Now, that my body is damaged due to so much exercise and bad eating habits, my body does not heal fast. Injuries take ages to heal and my body does not tolerate too much exercise.
Of course, I continue to love working out and running. I do it because I like it and it makes me feel good. The problem is I have the physical condition to workout for long hours, the motivation and the desire, too BUT my body does not tolerate it, anymore.
Believe me, I can not even do what a normal person does with regards to exercise. It is sooo frustrating! So, I keep trying and damaging my body more and more. Once I start working out, I do not stop until my body reaches its limits or I am about to injure some parts of it.Does it resonate a bit with food addiction? I love exercise and I do it to the point to injure myself every time I do it. Once I have started, I do not stop until my body is usually injured/damaged...",CASACERA,"Wed,11/25/2020-10:03am","much ""food"" for thought here, Annet","Thank you for responding. Some more details re: ""exercise"". When did you first begin actually running , or working out? How old were you? My switch over when eating food became my life jacket so to speak was between 12 & 14. Think it first was 8th grade when I would have been 13. But it happened so fast, in such a short time. Just the way people describe using a hard drug and being ""hooked"" so quickly. Important to repeat I have never had any other addictive behavior. Never smoked, drank (despite owning a successful bar and restaurant in NYC. This was also true in any other negative addictive behavior  that came my way. But, that's because I didn't continue to need any of these to live. How much ""exercise"" do you need and at what point does it or did it become destructive for your body? I love riding my bike but I only ride in warmer weather. First thing I do every yr. is check my balance. Been good so far so then I ride. But not this yr. and I miss it very much. Had surgery for a subdural hematoma but hope for next summer. Did I tell you I'm 86? Lots of things just wear out with age. But as Debbie Reynolds said ""Life is a fight"" and Carrie Fisher said about her mother Debbie in ""Bright Lights"" ""She's good at seeming good"". That's me. Folks say ""You look great!"", 'cause they don't see the inside ""stuff"" and I don't need or use a cane or walker and move around quickly. I told my therapist that I thought that change was possible until you pass away. So Annet I haven't given up my ""fight"" for the best quality of life I can muster. I simply would like to love food a little less. That can't come from an outside control but creating a drive equal to the one that pushes me powerfully to continue eating when my sensible sell tries everything available not to.

356,chia91,11/23/2020,Relapsing,"I remember the tears in my eyes and the happiness when 5 years ago I stopped my therapy sessions, discharged from my doctor. Since then, I did a lot of steps in my life, I moved out, I took some challenging decisions for my career, I moved in two different continents, and finally I got married. In the last year I faced some personal and professional challenges as well, far from home, far from the context in which I recovered, but I was sure I could manage it. Since the last time I moved, I'm feeling everything is against us, external problems are just appearing from nothing. At the beginning I was just repeating to myself ""It will pass, just face it and wait"", I kept holding on, but months by months the problems didn't stop coming, like if I was a magnet. I started to feel unstable, I started again to cuddle myself with food, then the binge eating crushed me and a few months later here again that stupid 'need' to compensate.
I'm just feeling exhausted, I feel my recovery-tools are far away from me, but most of all I feel that I'm a failure, walking for the same old wrong path again.In my heart I know that I will make it (again), but my energy is low, because I know how much the road is hard. Could anyone share is experience of relapse? How did you manage to stand up again?

I think many of us, if not all of us, have struggled with relapse throughout our ED recovery journeys. I certainly had many, many relapses as I worked toward my own recovery - so please know first and foremost you are not alone and from what I understand, relapse is a very normal part of ED recovery. It sounds like so many areas of your life are amazing - congrats on your travels and your marriage - but it sounds like it's also been a lot. Is your partner supportive of your recovery? I recently returned to therapy after a several year break and am finding it to be very helpful, and I'm able to meet with my therapist online so it's safe and honestly, really easy - no travel time to my appointment. ;)You are not a failure. It might feel like you're walking the same old path again, but I don't think that's true. You have identified this problem and have identified that although the road is hard, recovery is worth it. You know it. You are worth it. And you know you can do hard things - you already have. Don't lose sight of that. There are ups and downs in recovery, but you're always moving forward on the journey.What do you think? <3, STP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are curvy-skinny jeans and they fit me perfectly back in March 2020, thanks to  CV-19, no more Macy's jeans left in my closet that fit me correctly, ughhh I had planned to p/u a few blue prs at the mall today. Then instead I went to H and M clothing store and was Totally amazed over the sale clothing. I purchased a few nice girly t-shirts for motivating myself to walk. I have become Top Heavy as well as larger in my waist and hip measurements.

My job hasn’t allowed time for me to see my psychiatrist so I quit my medicine,Annet,"Wed,11/18/2020-9:57pm","Hi Blue44,","I think your health and wellbeing should be the priority. Why not to ask your manager for permission to see your therapist and phychiatrist every other week?
Quitting all medicine without professional supervision is usually not a good idea. I have done it and I have only ended up feeling worse. If you have been losing weight and feeling like hurting yourself, I think you are in a dark spot and you could benefit from seeing your team.

I still use a land line phone, along w/ my and bro's room TV's and my small laptop, and house phone....I have a video conference call later due on my laptop w/ my shrink. I'm nervous over this as again it requires some tech savvy ability just to log on to enter a video conference. It's like the process of this video call is leading me to feel anxious.

Practice makes mastery. So, it is just a matter of using technology.
If technology is causing you a lot of stress, ask a friend or someone you know is good at it, to help you practice joining video-conferences. You will see it is a fun way to learn something and at the same time, that will help you reduce the technology stress before your therapy sessions.This is call ""fear to the unknown"" but once it stops being unknown, you start enjoying the benefits of it.

371,zaffiedil,06/18/2020,New and uncomfy,"Hi all,
I am extremely new to do this and have never really openly talked about my issues with food. For starters, i have never been formally diagnosed with an eating disorder and im honestly not sure if I would like too. I dont know if what im experiencing is considered an eating disorder or something. However, within the past year I have had issues with eating, my weight and food in general and at this point its the only thing I really think about or care about. Growing up, I was always overweight and didn't eat right, which I acknowledge. However, I never actively tried to get healthy or to get to a healthy weight. My weight didn't really matter to me so I never thought about it. Though within this past year, I just felt so distressed about my appearance and so I turned to severe restricting and over excercising. I don't know honestly how I fell down the hole, it seemed to happen so quickly, but within 6 months I had lost almost half of my body weight and was continuing to lose. I was severly restricting, and over working my body in order to continue to lose weight and avoid food. My coworkers, family, and friends all noticed my rapid weight loss and several expressed concern over it, though I just played it off and said it was from me working so much (I was working 50+ hours a week in a restaurant). I eventually began to experience the negative impact of avoiding eating and I experienced a bunch of different medical issues, which are all still an issue and scare me. Calories and weight loss just consumed my life; I have tried to become better and work on my rituals and restrictions by myself though Ive gotten to the point where I know I cant do it alone. I think my family knows that theres something going on, though choose to not comment on it. I dont want to bring it up, or talk to them about it-- I get immense anxiety thinking about talking about my issues with them, and would rather avoid the entire experience all together. That being said, I would like to begin therapy and try to establish some form of recovery but I know I can't get away without my family knowing about it. I am just lost, and don't know who to turn to. I still am struggling with restricting and obssessing over my weight. Its my entire life now and I just dont know how to fix it.",yoyokay,"Tue,07/14/2020-6:57pm",Find a Support System,"It definitely seems like you could use some support.

I am going through a similar phase in my eating disorder, where I know that I need help and am having scary symptoms from undereating and losing so much weight. Getting the right doctors involved can really help, but I do encourage you to find a support system in your personal life as well.

Please try to relax during the moments when you are surrounded by food. I can understand how stressful and triggering may be to see everyone buying/having that food you just love to binge on. However, please stop, take a breath and observe people. Pay attention to how they behave with regards to food. Try to notice what a ""normal eating behavior"" looks like for people. Imagine yourself being able to get a large bag and to just eat one sweet at a time. Sometimes, imagining things is the first step to get them done.Stop imaging or thinking how your next binge will be and instead, image a binge-free day, week and year.Visualization is a real thing but it takes practice to get its real benefits.Hugs

377,DaraldTheHelper,10/16/2020,Questions about recovery,"Hello everyone, I was recently diagnosed as an underweight male and I have been trying to gain weight. Is it normal to have moments where I eat a lot of sugary and high carb food in one sitting but still not feel full? This week I have had multiple episodes where I would eat a lot of junk and was wondering if there was a way to prevent this? Do people have any tips on managing their intake of sugary food and trying to gain weight the right healthy way?",khanhp,"Tue,11/03/2020-11:31am",RE: Daraldthehelper,"Hey Darald, I think that you are doing just fine. Since your body is recovering from a long time of malnourishment, it is grabbing onto a lot of foods with very high energy count because it is afraid that it will be starved again. So I think that you should eat the foods that your body craves as a way to tell your body that it is safe and it would never be starved again. This part will not last forever, because eventually, your body will become adjusted and not so ""crazy"" around processed food, and you will even crave whole foods too. take care and love you!",Annet,"Tue,11/03/2020-11:17pm","Hi Darald,","I think you are having some binging episodes.

378,Aimsley81,10-08-20,"Abandoned, rejected and feel like a lost cause","I’m at an extremely low point in my life right now. In July/August I was receiving inpatient treatment for my ED then the hospital went into lockdown because of a new COVID-19 break out. My borderline personality disorder behaviours got so bad that they just let me go home. I’ve been out of hospital for just over a month now and my ED is at the worse it’s ever been. On Monday I started experiencing heart palpitations and was having major postural tachycardia. I went through the embarrassing ordeal of being taken to hospital by ambulance from a shopping centre I was at when the symptoms got worse. I got taken back to the same hospital I was at previously and the doctor in emergency said I was being admitted for the tachycardia. Then they checked my bloods and my potassium was also low. Because of that I had to have potassium via IV and was put on the ED protocol and had an NG tube inserted - which was not optional.  I was also told that I’d be staying in medical for 7 days to go through the re-feeding process (nil by mouth and Xml daily of water only).For some reason my potassium got lower even after the NG tube feeds had started and I had to have 4 more bags of potassium by IV. The second day was really boring. Had the dietitian see me to explain the protocol and when the feeding rates would be increased. Was reviewed by the medical team as well as psych. I told them that I was starting to feel ‘hungry’ and that was making me really anxious as I wanted to binge, so I got additional meds written up to help with that. Day 3 and I was reviewed by the medical team. I told them about my hunger issues. They left and a nurse came and increased the rate of my tube feeds from Xml to Xml. The nurse said they were now bypassing the protocol and putting me straight up to the highest rate. Then I had another review with psych who said that I had been cleared by the medical team and would be discharged that afternoon. I was so confused. I’d told them how low I was feeling, how poorly my eating was (non-existent) and how much I’d self-harmed.I’m at a complete and utter loss. I always thought that if I told them the truth and how badly I was struggling I would get the help that I so desperately needed, but I guess I’m not sick/thin enough to meet their criteria. My BPD did not handle this rejection well at all. I feel like a lost cause and untreatable. My psychologist called me that afternoon and I was just a mess. I reluctantly went and saw her today and told her that I’m done with all treatment and therapies. I told her that I just want to curl up and die and that if I get any symptoms like last time I’ll just let them get worse until i just collapse wherever I am. I don’t see the point in wasting more of anyone’s time seeing as I’m in the ‘too hard’ category. Sorry for the ramble :(Amy",2Healthy4me,"Thu,10/08/2020-5:03pm",How are you doing now?,"I hope you are seeing a therapist to deal with these issues.

383,2Healthy4me,10/22/2020,Intermittent Fasting Misdiagnosed as Bulimia on My Health Chart???,"It all goes back to when I was employed, before CV-19 that is, with my 2 different jobs....I was working hard as a sub teacher as well as an evening and weekend employee at my local mall job. I had been losing weight, and I loved how my hard physical work of fitting room duty, and keeping busy moving around my school campus classrooms, had helped me to tone up in a few months. I didn't have much time for real meals there so I sometimes didn’t have time to eat a real lunch...As a result of my hard work, I had lost weight and appetite was down. I saw my Dr while still working my 2 jobs. He seemed to notice that I had lost some weight. But didn't seem to do more than just notice my weight loss. Then CV-19 occurred and I had to find a new retail job. I hate driving in traffic so I thank God that i was able to land a job,  quite quickly,  and in walking distance from my lil apartment.Then once on a new time schedule, and more efficient break and meal schedule, I feel as though I have re-gained some weight and my walks have become brisk walks too as to try and tone up on days able to exercise, as no gyms, or pools are open for public use currently. So 1 day while here at my lap top, on a day off from work I took a quick look at my Kaiser Personal Info under my web site page. I read about a few physical and 1 MH condition which I had not been aware of. I realized that the 1 time I had to  see the ER for severe vomiting and stomach pain I actually was suffering from diverticulitis flare up.The next diagnosis I noticed under my med record was a lil diagnosis of having had Bulimia(which type?)  I think who ever entered that info on my med history file was jumping the gun on my label for suffering from Bulimia, which they claim is in Full Remission Now, after appearing Healthy and on the chunky side, I suppose?I have always been more on the over exercising/orthorexia side of ED's. I'm usually highly disciplined and every week I do seem to give in to a binge or 2, but Bulimia in Full Remission, OMG! I detest being labeled with this MH issue.I had seen a counselor @ KP for awhile and brought him goodies from my fav snack outlet, as a way of me not eating this junk food myself. Whenever I had visited a Dollar Tree I seemed to go into The Snack Zone and p/u foods to snack on, and donated them to my therapist. I felt like he was so thin that my donations to him might awaken his taste buds to new flavors and would begin eating more food.Then, over the Summer is when I saw my Dr last, the one who labeled me w/ as having xyz...That was around the time that I was actually beginning to have more of an appetite and was beginning to feel bloated and chunky.I suppose he too, had thought I was falling down for an old habit. A habit that i had   exchanged for exercising and reducing my snacks, I guess? So when i saw the New Label of Bulimia in my patient chart online here at home I was just very surprised to see that he judged me as having had Bulimia,  from our last session during the summer.

I became obsessed with trying to keep the number on the scale down and would restrict certain food groups to lose a few pounds every few weeks. In college I struggled by seriously limiting what I would eat because I was so afraid of weight gain. Since I graduated, I have been gaining some weight because I'm not running competitively anymore. I've been trying to follow my nutritionist's goals for me to not skip meals, but I've gained like X more pounds and I'm freaking out that my metabolism is permanently damaged and I'm just going to keep gaining weight no matter what I do. I workout like X days a week because I enjoy it and for my mental health. I feel like I need to do something to lose some weight.

I think it could be beneficial working with one. I understand that after you were a competitive athlete, you may want to continue working out excessively. I also understand you got used to a certain body type and that now, it is hard to accept some additional weight. However, eating disorders do not help you to get healthier, skinnier or happier. They only help you to get sick, miss a lot of nice life experiences and sometimes, you also end up gaining weight.I am telling you all the above because at College I was a competitive runner.I struggled with Bulimia and you know what? I used to injure pretty often, I gained weight with my behaviors and I didn't enjoy that period of my life. Nowadays, I am still paying for the consequences of all the damage I did to my body.I would say, look for some professional help and tell your co-workers to avoid leaving ""temptations"" visible during your shift.

I wish there was a little bit more guidance with my nutritionist because I get so easily consumed with trying to figure out what the heck to eat. I am trying to make sure that when I work out it's because I enjoy it and it makes me feel strong, I successfully skipped the gym last night to get some other things done that I needed to for school and I felt very good about that. I know that my body type in college was really not my natural it was forced by the miles I ran when I would have been a much better mid distancer than long distance. I am trying to accept that my body naturally does not want to be ultrathin and I feel better when I am stronger and well nourished. I also used to get injured alot. I'm trying not to restrict too much by getting too hungry but there are certain foods that I find if I them at all I will end up bingeing. My therapist said I may need to treat those foods like an alcoholic has to with alcohol and completely avoid them. I think I would feel much better physically for sure if I did that since they tend to make me feel sick anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

391,raine2036,10/19/2020,New to This,"Hi,
So most of my life I have been overweight and struggled with it. In my younger years I would see therapists for a small amount of time but usually, my weight was never really a part of those sessions, it was dealing with other trauma but I never stuck it out because honestly I never got anything from it. As a teenager, I was sent to a nutritionist but never stuck with that either. It was kind of a traumatic experience for me because she was not the healthiest looking person herself and yet was berating me and my choices and I was embarrassed and then just mad. I never considered that I had an actual disorder because to me that always meant you starve yourself and I certainly did not. However, with age comes wisdom and I realized I had a problem when I started hiding how many snacks I was having at night after everyone else went to bed. I feel absolutely disgusted with myself and I don't really know what to do. I am a very private person and have an unhealthy fear of rejection and ridicule so posting on a forum like this is way out sid of my comfort zone ut I'm desperate for a change and need some support. SO if you have taken the time to read this I just want to say thank you for caring.",2Healthy4me,"Mon,10/19/2020-11:32pm",Hello,"Welcome to the forum here. I was heavier as a kid as well. I focused on reading books, and sports. My parents made me eat only what was served for dinner, it was nutritious and that really helped me to lose some weight. Then I was able to fit into a swim suit and as a kid joined a swim team. I was a natural swimmer, and once I was in water I was a different girl. It was just the pool and me. I ignored anyone even around me and made new friends at the club. I stuck with mainly 2 sports as a kid. Both requiered wearing performance like tight fitting suits. I had my heart totally into swimming my best. This was really my saving grace since my heavier childhood between ages 7-10. Do you have anything that makes you feel alive and an active participant in your community?  Do you like journaling?  Take some time and think about how you may be able to accept yourself and realize that there is more to You than just your body image. Then Rise above your current mindset. Step outside and see what makes you feel your best. Good luck, and hopefully you might even find a therapist to see regularly to help you reach inwards to turn your feelings towards your self body image into the image of a healthier You.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
392,polinagalina,10-11-20,Breakfasts ,"Hey guys! I have been in recovery now for almost a year, but have just been really getting better in the last 3 months. Before I used to always restrict, ignore my hunger qeues, try to eat less than my meal plan etc. I ignored my hunger and didnt pay much attention to it since I was so used to it.
Recently though, I have been a lot less anxious around food and more accepting of recovery and weight gain (yay). I now have a new issue though - i wake up starving. Ill wake up at 3 or 4 am and no matter how hard i try and convince myself I NEED to go and eat. I usually end up having my breakfast then and then trying to cut down and sort of punish myself for doing that during the day. I feel like its just turned into a bad cycle - sometimes afterthoughts of blame and guilt come around, sometimes im able to fight them off. Nevertheless I dont want to continue doing this and am also extremely confused by this huge wave of hunger at such a random time.
I was wondering if anyone else has run into a similar issue or has any advice? Thank you!",Annet,"Mon,10/12/2020-9:15pm","Hi polinagalina,","Recovery is different to everyone but something that happen to a lot of us is to feel extremely hungry at first. I did not use to wake up in the middle of the night wanting to eat but I used to eat a lot during the day. I also used to feel guilty but you know what? Your body needs all that energy to work on its repairs. I would say ""listen to it"". This extreme hunger will not last forever. But for now, if you can discuss this with your team, it would be very helpful. Maybe your dietician can give you some more food at night so you do not have to wake up in the middle of it starving.Great job on accepting recovery!

I'm having a difficult time with the thoughts of ""this means your body is healthy now so you don't need to keep gaining."" How can I fight these thoughts?

However, that may not mean that your body is already completely recovered. Healing takes a lot of time and I am sure you have seen women who never lose their period even when they are too much underweight. There are other ones that are at their healthy weight and due to their eating disorder behaviors (not only anorexia), they have lost their period. Hence, having your period back might be a signal that your health is improving. Congratulations! But this is not the end of the ED Battle. You still need to continue following your teams' instructions until you are really healthy.Listen to your team. Their goal is NOT to get you fat.

396,2Healthy4me,10/14/2020,Went Shopping and Purchased a Few Items NOT on My LIST,"So when I arrived home I had purchased at least 4 items, trigger foods, that were not on my list. My period has skipped a week and am having PMS cravings really badly. I binged on these naughty foods. I looked at the Cals after eating the snacks I purchased and was very surprised to see that they were much higher than I thought when I put them into my shopping cart. I ate rather quickly and at the time w/o remorse. Now my stomach is extra bloated and I'm feeling guilty for having a High Calorie Binge just few minutes ago. I usually do well on sticking to my shopping list but nervous of returning to work for another few days from 8-5 schedule. I hate early morning shifts. When I feel anxious or like its not in my choosing to do something, like work an early shift, I tend to feel extra mad at myself for feeling weak and thus extra anxious over a schedule which I can't predict. Then i get 3 days off from work. I was as good as an angel for the past 2 days. But tonight i work and this is the day of my Big Cal Binge B4 work tonight.....Hate feeling dizzy and weak when I am not eating much on days off from work. No energy to go out and even do anything fun on these days off from work. When I must work a day shift, this seems to be the only time I must eat regular meals. We take breaks at work about every 2.5 hrs. They always remind me of when my meal time is. So I have gotten use to eating during break times at work or shoppiung for items for my breaks such as Ice Cold Tea or band aids, etc...Worried that my period hasn't arrived this month on time, as last month it arrived and before that it had skipped a good 3 months. This is stressful for me too. I hate dealing w/ bloating and sweet cravings b4 my period. Then when it's delayed I crave foods like this for even more days than I should, and don't drop weight as no period = no end to my PMS bloating or cravings.

  Every afternoon from 4 until I go to bed,  I struggle with memories that increase my depressive symptoms.   I've been emailing my therapist and I talked to my psychiatrist yesterday.  That's what has been going on with me.  I'm scared because I've thought of a way to self injur and I've found what I would use.
  I hope things get better soon.",Annet,"Wed,10/14/2020-6:34pm","Hi Tryingto heal,","I am sorry to hear you have been struggling. Uncovering memories is always painful BUT at the end, the goal is to help them come to the surface, ask yourself what you learned from them, talk about it with a trusted professional and then, let them go. Healing is a process and I understand it may take some time. However, you are strong and I am sure you will be able to deal with them.What kind of things have you been trying to do in the afternoon to distract yourself from those memories?
Have you found anything that works?Sometimes reaching out to someone helps. Other times, just sitting down, recognizing the intrusive memory and writing down about it can help you to process it.Please take care of yourself. Those memories will not be there forever.

399,Kristen00,09/30/2020,Slipping back,"A little background about me: 5 years ago I was deep in the trenches of anorexia. I was fired from my treatment team because I refused to go inpatient (they said it was unethical to continue to treat me outpatient because of my level of symptomatology). Multiple therapists refused to see me. I was on my own, over exercising and under-eating. I decided to make changes when I was in danger of losing my job when I passed out at work. Shortly after making a few changes, I got pregnant with my only biological child. I wanted to be healthy for her and gained A LOT while pregnant and nursing. I was weight restored. However, technically never fully recovered, I still was always thinking about calories and weight. But, I was not restricting or over exercising. I officially gained too much weight and became overweight. I decided it was time to get healthy and joined a program to work on selecting “healthy” foods and begin a new exercise regimen. This was supposed to be a 21 day challenge to get healthy. I have a personal coach who checks in daily. I am supposed to keep a daily log of food and send daily scale pictures. I have now lost a significant amount of weight and I am obsessed to watching the number on the scale go down. This program follows a plant based diet. My anniversary is tomorrow and I asked what would be a good option and they basically said nothing there is a good option. I told my husband, who was looking forward to a nice date night, that we can’t go to dinner because I wouldn’t be able to eat anything and asked if we could just stay home. I know I am going down a path I don’t want to go back down, but I am also excited to watch the scale go down and my clothes getting baggy.I am not sure why I am posting here because I am not sure I want to go back to seeing a therapist every other day. I am pretty sure my old therapist would still refuse to see me. I may have insulted his professionalism when I was fired. He breeched my confidentiality and went to my husband when he fired me for not agreeing to inpatient treatment. However, he is the only therapist I clicked with and trusted when I was in outpatient treatment.",marty2020,"Sat,10/10/2020-9:34am","Hi Kristen,","I hope you are doing well.

400,LuluBelle,10-10-20,Eating Plan Question,Hello!  I was just wondering what the general eating plan is for eating disorder recovery.  I am a former Bulimic and then Binge Eating Disorder and Night Eater.  I now still struggle with BED but not as much (my binges aren't as huge) but consistently struggle obsess with eating plans and changing my mind as to what to do with my food and exercise.  The silly thing I have noticed a lot of youtube or tiktok videos where people are recovering from eating disorders and they are saying things such as they do not restrict what they eat.  They eat 3 meals a day with a couple of snacks.  Is this the general eating plan for recovery?  Is there a book on this somewhere?  I have so many questions but this is where I'm starting.  I've never had counseling for an eating disorder but have handled this all myself for years.  Counseling sounds great but just expensive.,Annet,"Mon,10/12/2020-9:20pm","Hi Lulubelle,","Each person is different and no eating disorder recovery looks alike. Meal plans are also very different depending on each person's situation. Personally, I have always struggled with snacks. I keep trying to incorporate them. I do not have any issues with my 3 main meals but I usually struggle to eat my snacks. There are no rules with regards to how many snacks you should have. Your dietician will recommend one, two or three depending on your situation. The thing here is we do need to eat. That is the rule of thumb. Congratulations on being working on recovery.
BED generally improves if you have frequent meals and do not starve yourself. It also improves by postponing your binging urges and by doing things that help you soothe/reduce your anxiety.Hugs

It sounds cliche but time heals - with time you'll be able to be more accepting of your body.
I tried to explain the bloating to myself from a medical perspective - your body has been so undermalnourished for such a long time, its not used to the ammount of food youre eating. Eating consistenty on a daily basis will slowly help with the bloating as well. Lastly, ive never met you but im sure you are an amazing person. Your worth and who you are does not depend on the size of your stomach. Its so hard to see past looks but try and focus on the other qualities in yourself which you love and cherish.

I am not a home wrecker, and can never tell when a friendly man is single or not. It's not like men go around wearing a SINGLE stamped on their foreheads. Many married men, I see while working, don't even wear a wedding band. I think sometimes I eat out of a need to fill an empty void in feeling so alone, and single, and afraid every day to face a new day knowing there are taxes annually, and on anything I want such as a car, or savings account. Other reasons are fearing thoughtless people on the road, having to get my teeth restored(4 cavities???). Last year there were none?I just detest feeling hollow, alone and scared in the world, as if I could just drown in my tears if I were in touch w/ these past, present and future fears in my daily life....I take a few energizing vitamins, and walk when I can for exercise, but still not enough to fill my empty void inside of me, stemming from my inner core.",Butterfly2020,"Thu,10/01/2020-10:56am",Find out who you are,"The ED totally feels like it fills that void.

406,Riivka,09/30/2020,Attempting Recovery - Hitting Setbacks,"Hi all. I started counting calories at 16 which spiraled into anorexia and then bulimia. I was recently diagnosed with OCD at 23 which has made recovery quite a challenge (my brain really likes to hold onto numbers). I'm seeking out RDs in my area, but I'm curious to see how those who are self-recovering are managing. I have tried mindful/intuitive eating, but it always stresses me out to relinquish control (I know, I know, that's the point of an ED). Counting calories makes me feel good for a week... and then it's back to square one with obsession. I had a REALLY bad binge/purge session last night and my brain is screaming at me to not eat today, but I know that will only exacerbate the problem. On the other hand, I'm afraid eating will trigger my OCD and I'll be stuck in an obsessive loop all day. I am getting help for the OCD, but it's still under new management, if you will. Looking forward to hearing about others' stories. I'm optimistic in the long run, but short-term, I'm feeling a bit discouraged at the moment!",Annet,"Wed,09/30/2020-9:38pm","Hi Riivka,","Eating disorders recovery is tricky and it may be easier and faster with the help of a professional team. With this I do not want you to think that no one ever has recovered on his/her own. However, due to the complexity of the problem, it is less exhausting to do it with more support. Some people may get discoraged due to too many failed attempts (with or without help). So, from my point of view, it is better to have someone to share the load with. Also, a specialist in ED treatment can guide you through the different steps of the recovery process and to provide you with an outsider view of the way things are going on for you. Think of it.On the other hand, I am sorry to hear you had b/p episode last night. Please nourish your body today. It got depleted of nutrients and you many not be feeling well. Take rest. Do not starve yourself and try to think positively. With regards to ""control""...well, we usually think we have the control by counting calories, working out or controling what we eat. The truth is our ED is the one that has taken over the control of our lives. And we need to fight that.Hugs

410,ecdysis,09/25/2020,Moderation or abstinence?? Please help!,"Hey everyone!This is my first post on this website. I hope this doesn't trigger anyone, I've just been driving myself crazy recently and desperately need to hear some other perspectives.I have dealt with anorexia/binge eating/compulsive eating for years now. Although things are better than they used to be, they are certainly not 'normal' and seem to be getting worse the longer I ruminate on this topic. I have researched eating disorders exhaustively and have come to see how they mimic addiction; many books suggest that it is certain compounds in foods that make them so addictive and cause cravings etc. etc. and, therefore, should be abstained from in a similar manner to which an alcoholic would completely avoid alcohol. I have tried this method and had some luck. However, more recently I have started a relationship and suddenly I have to consider someone else's interests and desires; though abstinence may be possible on an individual level, it seems impossible to have a relationship whereby I cannot attend family dinners/restaurants/go on holidays abroad and enjoy new foods due to my abstinence. I feel as though I am going insane and the pressure is starting to build as I feel increasingly guilty about avoiding dinners at his family home and increasingly worried about the prospect of eating abroad. Moreover, this whole scenario is increasing my obsession surrounding food! I am currently completely lost and feel as though I don't know which direction to go in: should I try to ease my rules around food instead in the hope that I will become less obsessed that way, or create tighter rules so that I don't have to worry about attempting (and potentially failing) at moderation. Please help!Surely this is a problem that someone has dealt with and can offer some advice towards?? Perhaps someone who has strictly adhered to a keto/atkins/paleo diet?? TLDR; think it is in my best interest to give up these foods completely but not sure how to deal with dinner at friends' house/restaurant meals/eating out on holiday. Am unsure as to whether attempting moderation of certain foods would ease obsession or whether it would increase food anxiety further.",CASACERA,"Sun,09/27/2020-11:02am","""moderation"" is such a great word","I only speak for myself but compassion for others and SELF COMPASSION helps me survive in my rocky road to manage my affliction.

There is no magic formula. However, relationships are part of a healthy life and food so it is. So, we need to be ""open"" to all types of food.

I just want you to realize that restricting will only numb you out for a while but the problems will continue to be there.I have been told multiple times by different people that first, I need to be fine in order to help others. Well, if you continue to engage in your eating disorder, it could be hard for you to help your husband get better. Imagine if he thinks that by drinking you are going to stop starving yourself... We all know that is not the way things work.If his alcoholism is causing you trouble, please talk to him. Suggest him that you both may benefit from some professional help. You both deserve to be happy.Hugs

I do know this is something I need to face and talk with him about again. We've been married 20 years so alcohol certainly isn't a new issue. Things got pretty bad last year and he quit for a while but without any outside support besides myself. Of course Covid and buying/selling/renovating a house and moving the family during April didn't help. I don't know why it's so hard for me to talk with him about it. We tend to dance around the issue. I worked with my Enneagram coach yesterday and she gave me some good insight on how we are each enabling each other. I'm trying really hard to get myself better as this ED reared its ugly head after nearly 2 decades asleep. I think I have a lot of fear that things will get as bad as last year emotionally, but I know that controlling my eating won't change that.

419,Aimsley81,09/22/2020,Feeling abandoned....,"Hi there,I’m a new member and just wanted to reach out and get some thoughts, opinions or advice from anyone willing to offer it. So where do I start? I’m 38 and I’ve been living with an eating disorder for the past 8 years. It has changed over time but my current diagnosis is anorexia - binge/purge subtype. I also have borderline personality disorder. My behaviours were becoming so unbearable and at the beginning of the year I reached out to my GP for some treatment. My last lot of treatment was over 7 years ago and it was a terrible experience and I was terrified about the thought of having to go through all of that again. But I decided that I needed to try. I got referred to see someone at a local hospital as an outpatient who could then refer me on to the appropriate program I needed. I only had two appointments with him but we talked a lot about my history and agreed that going for inpatient treatment would be a much better option due to my declining health. So I went on the waiting list and I finally got the call back in July that a bed had become available and I needed to go to the emergency department to be processed and then transferred to the mental health unit. Unfortunately my body decided that was not to be the case and I needed to stay in the medical ward for 10 days due to low potassium. I had the very unpleasant experience of having my first NG tube - which was not negotiable. When I was finally medically cleared to be transferred I had to wait for another bed to become available, delaying the process even further. To cut a long story short, I spent a total of 5 weeks on the mental health ward getting inpatient treatment for my ED. It was a really good program. There was 5 of us ED patients and I had a great team of nurses, doctors, social worker, psychologist, dietitian, registrar and psychiatrist. We had supportive meal therapy 6 times a day, one-on-ones with each of the team, team reviews twice a week and music therapy. They also had a ‘leave’ program that you made your way through as you progressed in treatment. In 4 weeks I had finally made it to level 2 where I would be allowed 2 hours of leave off of hospital grounds and had to have a meal or snack in that time. It was not to be as we had our second outbreak of COVID-19 and the hospital went into full lock down - no leave and no visitors. My last week in hospital I was in full self-destruct mode and my BPD was in full swing. To my huge surprise they gave me weekend leave and I got to go home. I was so happy to be going home but that was not without its challenges as I’m living with my parents and they’ve been so unsupportive for my recovery. I was home less than 24 hours when I completely relapsed after one of the comments my mother made to me. I have now been home for 3 weeks and my ED behaviours are worse than ever. As I’m on a Treatment Authority I’ve attended every one of my outpatient appointments and have been completely honest with my team about everything that’s been happening.  Even after telling them all this, the psychiatrist still discharged me. I’m just at a complete and utter loss. I feel really cheated out of this opportunity of a really good inpatient program and just feel completely abandoned. I should have been inpatient for 3 months, working my way through the leave program and participating in eating challenges but instead I got sent home with no support, no therapy and basically no hope. Thoughts, feelings and behaviours have gotten extremely bad - in all areas. And I have told all of this to my GP, psychologist, psychiatrist and occupational therapist. I’m also so disappointed in myself for not being stronger and letting the comments my parents have made to me get to me. I’m also waiting on a medical clearance before I can return to work so my days are long and boring and I’m not able to get out much due to an injury in my left ankle that’s causing significant pain. I’m just feeling so down about my current situation and feel so trapped. Sorry this post was so long. Any suggestions would be hugely appreciatedAimsley81",Annet,"Tue,09/22/2020-8:10pm","Hi Aimsley,","I am sorry to hear you are struggling. However, I would like you to recognize the long way you have gone. I think you can still take advantage of your learnings in treatment and try to be back on track. At the end, I am sure you want to recover.I do not know and I do not have a lot of information about it. But in my case, I had to move to live on my own. Staying at home with my parents and sisters used to be very triggering. Every time I went to visit them, I ended up acting on behaviours. That does not happen, anymore BUT it took a lot of hard work in therapy and also, moving out of my parents' home.Think of it. Check if living on your own could be beneficial to your recovery.Hugs

420,2Healthy4me,09/17/2020,@ Work Eat Small Snacks @ Home after work Feel 2 Numb to eat ,"So, i usually work a 8 hr shift @ work. My hours have been creeping up and nearing about 30 hrs a week. I feel frustrated that I  work a full day, prefer snack meals at work, come home and feel spacey and disconnected and cant eat real meals w/o choking on my meals.I feel frustrated that I work more hours and stand most the time and my hourly pay is like a 1/3 of what i earned as a substitute teacher. I feel unreal at home with extra time, on the days off from any structured paid work. Try and do chores, but always need to grocery shop, check emails, and connect w/ a few other places when I'm home at the apartment here. I dislike eating meals here at home because for the past 7 yrs, I tend to choke on real meals, and can only swallow and commit to small snacks, or side dishes, not entire meals. Think stomach has shrunk. I miss my shrink as he has relocated to a different city for his practice. My other 1 retired and the 1st 1 I had is too darn far away to go for monthly check ups-mini sessions. I am gaining weight since CV-19 began and feel utterly miserable. I take energy gummies but they are not working . I need more for my height and weight as the recommended amount is like 1 cup of coffee or so.I feel daring and want to take more to see how many i need b4 i feel any rush of energy from these Energy Gummies.

421,alaynaofavalor,09/17/2020,I feel like I have a unique situation any advice would mean the world ,"havent been diagnosed professionally, but i as far as i know i was having anorexic tendencies for about 6 months.
in the beginning of quarantine i wanted to lose some fat and i began excercising everyday and eating at a deficit. when i first noticed it working i became infatuated with it i was working out. i am an athlete, so my body was never very thin to begin with, i had more muscle mass across my body than fat and i was getting by my whole life on over X calories a day. when i reduced my calories at first i was very hungry but i refused to eat past the limit I gave myself. id notice that if i did, id gain weight immediately the morning after and so i kept it strict to X and so on. this continued about 5 months and it wasnt until I had some weird symptoms that i realized i had a problem. i would also body check everyday, constantly measure myself and i would refuse to eat certain foods. id check every ingredient of what i ate and track my calories everyday and making sure my diet was filled with “whole” foods. i think orthorexia is what they call it but i dont want to diagnoss myself. and actually thinking about this, these arent normal behaviors ive realized that now. my diet was actually very horrible my whole life and until quarantine id never gained any weight until soccer stopped and i wasnt active. id never worked out before until then and looking back i wasnt even “fat” i was actually very slim and i just couldnt see it. i just want to get out of this mindset and idk how. i asked my mom to take me for my physical but told her it was just for soccer coming up since we need to be passed in the last 6 months beforehand. my doctor said i was at a healthy weight for my height and i tried explaining to her my worries about my symptoms and so on i gave her a summary of what was happening to me but she basically just dismissed it as “oh it’s normal for someone your age” and giving me all the doctor talk not helping me at all. ive tried confiiding in my sister as well but she is self obsessed didnt really seem to actually care and basically continues to make everything in the family about her. i tried even hinting to my mom and she closed me down. i didnt know what to do but i didnt want to feel unhealthy and unenergized anymore and at the time i was ready to accept the fact id gain weight to get better. i decided to try to help myself and im now doing the best i can to gather the correct information on getting better and its been very hard. i keep seeing that when people start to eat more they will gain weight but as time goes on it will be evenly distributed and somewhat youll fill in in all the right places with time, but does that go for me as well? since im at a healthy weight and i was never considered unhealthily skinny before? i have been starting to eat when im hungry and listening to my body, and ive tracked my calories judt to see about how much that is, and it seems my body is satisfied at around X per day. ive stopped all excercise except for soccer practice X days a week. ive already noticed water retention and weight gain only X days in and i keep trying to stay positive telling myself itll all work out but since my situation is different it feels like the weight i gain wont redistribute after all. i feel horrible when i eat everyday physically, i bloat A LOT and it makes me feel worse so ive been trying to eat low fiber which is denying my of some of my favorite foods, since i like eating healthily i cant eat these without bloating up immensely and makes the weight gain seem worse. i was just wondering if you have any advice for me because i truly dont know what i should do. i feel as though im on the verge of starting up bad habits again and i want to get through this.
that was an email id try to get in contact with someone with a blog that sums up my situation. its been about a month since i took things into my own hands now. i want to get professional help but i dont want to cause a commotion in my family, (especially with money) or for my mom who works 24/7 as a single mom with 3 kids. ive taken the time to assess myself and im subtly restricting myself monitoring my calories and subconsciously not wanting to go X. ive also started soccer for X days a week now. the first 2 weeks were hell. i felt horrible everyday my only comforting thought was knowing i wasnt alone and other people go through this too. the bloating went down to a manageable level, the weight gain seemed to be proving a good thing, until almost overnight it seemed like i gained a ton more. ive been desperately trying to think positively and trying not to start excercising and restricting. school isnt helping either, i barely have enough motivation to do homework. any advice would help.",Tryingtoheal,"Fri,09/18/2020-6:54pm",Sorry you're struggling ,"My best advice would be to talk to your family about getting professional help,  like a therapist,  or talk to your school guidance counselor.",Annet,"Sat,09/19/2020-12:18am","Hi alaynaofavalor,","We all are different and our eating disorder behaviours are different, too. I know there may be a lot of similarities but if you put several of us together, even when we have exactly the same diagnosis, you will notice our problems are not identical.
Eating disorders are monsters and the sooner you get some treatment the better. If you are still at school, try to talk to some of your school counselors. Also, keep trying to get your parents hearing/supporting you.By reading your post, I hear you do not feel comfortable with your relationship with food. Regardless your weight and your behaviours, if food, body image and/or exercise are a problem, then, you need help.Recovery is worth it and I really hope you to get the light and guidance you deserve.Family's are free to take illneses however they want but what really matters is that you get the help you need.

Does anyone have any tips or advice to stop?",Annet,"Tue,09/15/2020-7:39pm","Hi Lilyj,","I am sorry you have been struggling with binging. I experienced binges for a while and some of the things that used to help me were: a) Eat with someone. If you have dinner on your own, it is easier to binge... b) Postpone the binging urges... First for 5 minutes, then, 10 and eventually, you will realize that after 20 or 30 minutes the urges are gone c) Brush my teeth d) Go out for a walk e) Visit/call someone f) Do not skip any meals during the day. If you restrict during the day, your urges to binge might get stronger at night g) Whenever ""I had already decided to binge, I used to try to binge on certain foods"". Of course, those ones were not ""binge foods"" for me and I used to stop eating. i) Letting myself try ""fun foods"" at other times of the day. Overtime, this action helped me reduce my cravings and binging urges for sweets/desserts.

Using the forums to express your feelings and to get encouragement from others can be useful on the road to recovery, so it’s understandable that you’re disheartened by the lack of responses. It’s hard to fight this battle alone, and you shouldn’t have to. You asked how you can take the first step towards get help; but, to me it seems that, by posting to the forums, you’re already advocating for yourself and reaching out for help, which is a really big step to begin with. Discussing this with professional who can help guide you may be beneficial, and you can use the NEDA helpline for assistance in finding the right treatment option for you. They are also there for support as well. Remember that you’re not alone and that recovery is always possible. Take care.",Annet,"Sat,09/12/2020-10:22pm","Hi Aulis,","I know the feeling of getting the ""Template answers"" most of the moderators paste. I wished they wrote something to people besides pasting the official replies. Anyway, with regards to your question, I think you have already given your first step: ""Recognizing that you have a problem and that you want to change"". The next step is to find out some professional help. Doing so sometimes requires opening up to your parents, husband, friends, relatives, etc.
Then, you will need to trust your treatment team. Believe me, you will be challenged. You will be encouraged to stop your behaviors, to eat healthy, normal size meals, etc.
For sure, your eating disordered-self will reveal against them. But keep going.
Recovery is HARD but worth. Our eating disorders lie to us and make us feel in control of the situation when in reality, our eating disorder is the one controlling us.If people have started already noticing, I am sure you feel pretty uncomfortable with it. In my personal case, I do hate when people notices it or make any comments related to my weight.
Unfortunately, that is something we can not avoid but we need to ensure we set appropriate boundaries with them. Especially if they make you feel uncomfortable.Please start looking for some treatment options. The sooner, the better. You will not repent. Eating disorder specialists will guide you to recovery one step at a time.In the meantime, be nice with yourself and think of food as fuel for your body. Life in this world runs thanks to the food everyone eats.Hugs

In addition to feeling sick and being in a constant state of physical discomfort, I feel so completely empty and drained and not present with my body. I am operating on such a basic functioning auto pilot. At my job, I am an office assistant. I have administrative tasks as well as receptionist/phone duties. I feel so weird every time that I pick up the phone because the energy I have to use to sound polite and professional is so forced and I am not even fully conscious of what I am saying and being told. Even simple things are hard for me to be mentally engaged in, like watching movies or reading. Every day it seems like my brain is running at slow speeds or like I am disconnected from my body. I have had a much longer work commute because due to wildfire warnings, I was not able to be at my own home and have been staying with my mom. During these 1 hour and 15 minute drives, my head feels woozy and I feel like I am floating. I am trying to ignore thinking about gaining weight and just think about all of the ways in which I will feel better if I start eating more and get healthy. I have been so afraid of weight gain that I have not made any effort to eat enough to gain any pounds, but I am really tired of feeling like this and not being able to really do anything with my life because I am constantly tired and can’t think straight.

But as soon as I get close to food and smell ithe up close, it feels like a punch in the stomach and nose and I start feeling extremely sick.

Do any other people who binge eat feel guilty about not purging or not being able to fast long enough?",whiteblossom05,"Wed,09/02/2020-9:50pm",You are not alone,"I'm struggling with everything you said as well. Just because your weight is ""healthy"" doesn't mean you shouldn't reach out for help. I feel guilty for not fasting long enough almost everyday, but once I wait and eat at that exact time I end up binging and the cycle continues. I tried breaking my bad habits and started eating when I wanted and what I wanted and reduced how often I binge. I hope this helps. :)",Annet,"Thu,09/03/2020-11:17pm","Hi Donna,","Hi Donna,In my case, it helped a lot to see a phychiatrist and get some medication prescribed. After some weeks on it, my anxiety levels decreased and my binges, too.Of course, it took a long time to stop the problem but I want you to know that it is possible and you can do it.Some of the things that helped me:a) Postponing the bingeing urges. Tell yourself you will eat all that you want within 20 minutes...Then, 30, then 1 hour and so on. Sometimes, the urges dissapear after some time.
b) Brush your teeth and go out for a walk
c) Take a shower
d) Ask someone you trust for help to distract you from your bingeing urges
e) Read your journal (particularly a page that remembers you how you felt the day after a binge)
f) Therapy
g) Do not skip any meals and do not avoid any types of food. If your body knows food is always available and fun foods, too, it will not feel like bingeing on them.Cheers

442,PxmpkinSpice,07/30/2020,Struggling,"In my last post I talked about wanting to tell my parents about my anorexia. Last Friday, the 24th, I told my mom. She told me that she didn’t believe me because I ate, but she reluctantly agreed to get me a therapist. I have yet to hear an update on that. Just because I eat doesn’t mean I eat enough or at all when am I am by myself. I have always been a picky eater, and I’ve always eaten around friends and family to hide my eating disorder, so it hurts to see her not support me and also not believe me. Along with this, since I’m picky, when I refuse to try or eat something my mom now says “this is why you don’t eat,” publicly in front of the rest of my family. I now feel like in order to show her I’m not lying to her, I need to lose a tremendous amount of weight again, and I’m struggling with how to cope. I lost my appetite even more especially since I just recently experienced a breakup and am depressed. I no longer want to recover, but want to at the same time.",Annet,"Thu,07/30/2020-11:17pm","Hi PxmpkinSpice,","Hi PxmpkinSpice,I can imagine how terrible you feel BUT I want you to know that it is very common for parents to NOT see and accept the reality. Most of them never think an eating disorder can happen within their family. Are you still a student? If so, maybe you could talk to one of your school counselors. Anorexia is a deadly disease and we do not want you to be at risk.In my personal case, if people saw me eating, they could never imagine I had an eating disorder. I used to eat normal amounts of food for a sedentary person. Unfortunately, I was overexercising and that caused my anorexia to take my body to the limit. As of now, I am dealing with the consequences of all the damage I did to my body. So, the sooner you decide to recover and look for some treatment options, the better.With regards to the encountered thoughts and desires, let me tell you that even after several years of fighting for my recovery, I still have them. For example: I want to recover but I don't. I want to eat but I don't. I want to have a healthy life but I don't, etc. etc. etc.I would say, listen to the ""angel"", to the ""good thoughts/feelings and ideas"". You are brave and your life and health are worth it.Hugs
Alma",Leaneaustin,"Fri,08/28/2020-7:40pm","Alma,","Alma,  I totally hear you. I lost some weight. Half of it was on purpose. Working out and watching what I ate to the point that I actually developed a disease that kept me from eating. Counting every calory until I panicked if I went past a certain number. I've always had a problem with my weight going up-and-down and a problem with binging and it got worse when I got diagnosed. All the sudden my diet had to change and that's when it blew up. I wander around the house opening and closing the cabinets looking for food. I have gained some weight. The doctor wants me to more weight. At my lowest point I was the weight I was in junior high. I am 54 years old. The idea of gaining more weight makes me anxious and the doctor actually put me on a medication to help me stop binging because that makes me anxious too. I am not working right now so I am home alone all day. I cannot eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, so my diet is primarily carbs with some protein.  This is due to the disease. It's hard not to gain weight, but the idea of gaining....I have a counselor and she helps but she can't be here all the time.

Always feeling fat even at a healthy weight, not having an idea what my body actually looks like, going on every diet in the book, starving myself, working off twice as many calories as I’ve consumed, taking laxatives etc. Ive always felt different, fatter, uglier than most people when everyone seems to tell me differently.

Based on doctors visits X pounds and counting, but I am still considered a healthy weight. For me, even with me not eating I feel like I am just gaining weight. I kind of hoped it was medical related, but deep down knew it wasn’t. After going to different clinics, ER’s and doctors and running every lab under the book everything was normal. The only thing keeping me running was a bottle of nutrition drink and some water. I’m severely dehydrated and starving, but still won’t eat. I know I need help, but I feel like I won’t be taken seriously because I don’t look like I have an eating disorder. I just don’t want to feel this way anymore.

Once it gets these foods more frequently,  the less you'll crave it.  A lot ED sufferers go through this.  I definitely went through it and I am now recovered.

It happened to me and it was awful.
One of the explanations I have heard is that your body is so used to starvation that the day when you nourish it, it wants more and more. Your body does not know when you will give him food again.About the junk food, yes! Our body craves for things that we have been avoiding. Try to get help from a dietician so you start giving your body what it needs. Little by little, binges will go away as you will be providing your body with all types of food.On the other hand, it is important that you get some treatment because eating disorders wear different masks. I went from Anorexia to Binge Eating and then, Bulimia. So, we do not want that monster to experience any mutation in your case.Hugs

452,BuNnY1216,08/20/2020,Feel Ignored,"I think I have anorexia and depression and I am here because I don't know what else to do. This is my first post so here goes:
I told my parents about how I was struggling and that I want/need help, but they think it is just a phase. They are being very supportive but they don't see that this is an actual problem. They said that I was being ""sensitive"" and that everyone goes through this and that I'm just not able to handle it. I've recently started thinking that this is too hard and I wish everything would just stop. My hair keeps falling out and I haven't had my period in 7 months. I keep looking in the mirror and feeling so fat and I have literal folders full of names of food and I don't know why but I can't stop. Everyday is crying and even I know that sometimes I have emotional outbursts. I feel really bad and feel really selfish because I know my parents are trying their hardest and sometimes I think maybe I am just sensitive and I should be able to deal with this alone. Lately, I've been trying to get better and eat more food/less exercise and conquer certain fear foods without having a ""cheat day"" and beating myself up the next day but it is so hard sometimes because my whole family is now becoming super diet-conscious and THEY are decreasing their portions and exercising more . It makes me happy that they are being healthier but at the same time it makes recovery really hard for me and also sometimes makes me think that it all my fault. I really want to be happy and normal again but I feel like everyone has given up and I have emotionally drained them. I also feel really emotionally drained and have just kind of given up on everything too. I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense, as I'm not that good at putting my thoughts into words.",Annet,"Thu,08/20/2020-10:22pm","Hi BuNnY1216,","First of all, congratulations on recognizing you have a problem. That is the first step to recover.
Secondly, it is great that you already tried to talk to your parents.
I do not know why but usually, our families are the last ones to accept their child has an eating disorder or a mental illness. They see it, they somehow know it but in many cases, they are terrified to accept it. Or as you said, they only see it as ""normal"" for our age.I would say, tell them you would like to talk to phychologist or talk to one of your school counsellors. I think they could help you talk to your parents to make them aware of the situation.
You deserve to get proper help. The sooner the better.Cheers

454,walker94,08/17/2020,8 years in,"First time saying this outloud in a while...Started when I was 17 to lose weight — healthy eating and purging. My craving binges became more extreme when I saw that I could control the fact that it wouldn’t affect my weight. Friends and family caught on, but I convinced them I had stopped.18-23, I purged daily. Sometimes once, sometimes full cycles of binge purge. My teeth lost all enamel and I had to get them fixed. I had always grinded my teeth so I was able to blame it on that. Also, I didn’t look bulimic anymore. I binged so heavy, stopped working out and binge drank on the weekend and gained more weight than felt healthy. That’s one of the hardest things to think about.24-25, now almost 26, I have a better control on it. I have a great boyfriend, a great job, I purchased a home... but I still sneak to purge. Typically only meals out or dinners at home in which I feel like I over indulged. I can’t go a whole week and I don’t know why. I’m working out more than I ever have, I “look” great, and doctors who don’t know I’m sick think that I’m in amazing shape and my bloodwork is perfect. I’m an activist in my community and I’m a loving supportive friend.I have this big secret that I forget is a secret, because it’s all I know. I can’t even cry about it because I don’t hate myself. I really don’t. If anything, I can be too confident in myself and my outward accomplishments. I’m in my best place yet and I think this is my time to get to recovery. I don’t have much auxiliary income for therapy but I’m ready to take steps. I don’t want to look at the love of my life, feel so happy, and think how I’m gonna escape to the bathroom at the restaurant. Not to mention, I know have extreme guilt for the food I’ve wasted over the years when people can’t afford to eat or don’t have access to meals. I don’t want to get sick when I’m older or have my teeth fall out or lumps in my throat. I’m not ashamed. I will talk about disorder to my friends and family, they just think it stopped when I was 18.

456,swamprosemallow,08-06-20,Just want to feel better,"I've been struggling with disordered eating for about 3 years and it started out as just starving myself but for the past year I have been binging and it's only got worse since the pandemic. I am striving towards a career in dance so I have always been very focused on how my body looks which is probably a reason why I started unhealthy habits in the first place. Because I am so focused on eating healthy and being thin, its hard for me to tell how serious my disorder is and if I can recover without help. I may not be binging as often or as much as other struggling with the same disorder but the way I feel after a binge is very real and very scary. When I only starved myself I never wanted to seek help of tell anyone because it is what many dancers do. Now I want to get better and have a healthy relationship with food and my body. Some days I hate my body so much. I want to get more serious about trying to recover from this but I do not know what to do.
I opened up to my mom about it once when I was at a very low point but whenever she talks to me about it again I cannot speak, I feel like I just shut down. I am so ashamed of my behaviors I cannot share what I do or how I feel about it to my own mom. Often after I binge I become depressed for days and I feel very bad because my mom says things like ""I'm the worst mom, I can't help my own daughter, she won't talk to me"" which makes me more upset because its not about her and I don't want to make her feel guilty. I end up keeping everything inside so I don't make anyone feel bad. I feel like all my problems are weighing me down and I want to get better, I really do. I just can't see how I could open up to a stranger when I feel anxiety talking to someone so close to me.",Emjem323,"Sat,08/08/2020-10:57am","I bet you are beautiful,","I bet you are beautiful, inside and out!

I ignored this poor, misinformed, xyzzz and carried on with my daily chore in keeping my place clean, bug free, and smelling as usual, nice, clean and fresh for my quality of cleanliness. That eve I walked over to my local grocery store. I purcheased a few groceries, and a gal of something that felt good to eat in this hot, muggY weather. I ate the entire gal of this specific dessert. I just couldnt stop.I was feeling angry at being judged by this meek person who used vile words, as if she were paid to speak this way towards me. There was nothing i could do to make this situation right. I harbored my Anger of being judged, and perhaps even slanderized  by her housemates. There is no way this individual could have looked at me and made this judgement on her own.....!!Anyhow, I finished off the entire gal of sweet sorrow and experienced insomnia all night afterwards. I was feeling way to flushed, and like there was no air for me to breath. I watered down some kitcheN dish Cloths and must have finally fallen asleep. I awaken this morning at 8AM and felt refreshed, alert, and numb to any emotional distress that I had felt the eve prior to this morning. Amen God, I hope life gets better from this moment on.

That former relationship  pre-occupied me during the time I should have been attending alumni gatherings, funerals, amusement parks, concerts, and my old flame sport of roller skating at rinks with smooth rink floors.

I've tried purging and exercising just so i don’t gain. i never thought or considered having an eating disorder till a few weeks ago when i realized that i wasn’t in control of my life anymore. i thought i had fixed everything, but my mindset has never been in the right place. i worked out with a sprained ankle, after getting my wisdom teeth out, and when i was sick. I have tried different diets and i cannot find a way to enjoy eating. i’ve only told two people what my problems are. and i feel like i should tell my parents, but i don’t know how they will react. i’ve never felt alone with my body, and i just want freedom to live how i want. but i know i will never have it. i have been constantly working out for 3 years. I lost X in one summer, and at some point i gained it back, but now i’m X again. i weigh myself weekly, and whatever the scale tells me will either make me happy for crush me. when it gets lower and lower i get happy. i feel like i need to be thin to finally be happy with myself and who i am. i miss certain foods. i can’t bring myself to eat them or else my mind will make me feel like i just gained. ive been called out by people for sucking in my gut to look smaller, and i just feel so much shame. I dislike my body, and no matter what i’ve done, it’s not enough ever. but i’ve never felt like i had anyone on my side. i tell everyone that body confidence is key when i have none. i can’t wear bikinis or tank tops when i just want to feel great. and i could cry looking at pictures of myself cause some days i just feel that bad. i want to find help. i want to finally live. 3 years of my life have been taken. and i know if i keep going like this more will be taken. i was so stressed by my school and work schedule trying to slip in a workout in between, so i can keep up my figure and not lose it. i mean i can’t even find any rest. i will pace around the house to burn excess calories so i can feel good enough to eat another meal. i’ve skipped family meals cause i didn’t want to eat anymore calories. i hate how i live. but i can’t stop. help.",OneDayorDayOne,"Sat,08/15/2020-3:31am",Hey there.,"Hey there.

Recovery is hard and it takes some time. But now that you have recognized you have a problem, you will start moving forward.
Look for some professional help in your area. Those people will be able to guide you in the right direction. Don't be afraid to ask for help to your parents. If you are unable to tell them you have an eating disorder, tell them you would like to talk to a phychologist. If they ask why, tell them you are still not ready to tell them but that eventually you will.
Or look for some help at your school. Sometimes they offer counseling services for free. That could be a good start and they could also help you to tell your parents. This because in most of the cases, schools only offer a limited number of sessions...I wish you the best and trust me, you can get better

I've been struggling with binge eating, body dysmorphia, bulimia, and restrictive dieting for 16 years (I'm 28). In a couple months I'm planning to move in with my boyfriend who doesn't know I binge eat. When I stay at his house I sneak food that I dont normally let myself have and overeat when hes not home. I'm terrified of him finding out and losing his respect and attraction to me. On top of this he has a daughter who is approaching the age that this nightmare began for me. I want so badly to be a good role model for her and to help her develop a healthy relationship with food and her own body but in 16 years I havent been able to do this for myself. I feel an increasing sense of pressure and urgency to get ahold of this thing but it seems the more pressure I put on myself the worse it gets. I've binged every day for the past week or so and have had two bulimic episodes. My normal control strategies have stopped working and I'm reaching out here as a last effort to deal with this before I end up passing it on to the next generation.

I hope you find what you are looking for here.
Secondly, if you are about to share your life with a partner, why not to talk to him about this situation? Even if you do not tell him, he will eventually notice it. So, it is better if you share your struggle with him once and for all and begin treatment.If you are unsure as of how to talk to him about this, you can start by getting the help of a therapist. He/She can help you to talk to him or they can even talk to your partner on your behalf.I am sure you want your partner's daughter to have a healthy relationship with her body and food. This can be a real challenge if we are not fine. However, it can also become a motivator to achieve full recovery.Use this situation to get better and to practice an open and honest communication with your boyfriend. I am sure he will be supportive.Hugs

465,kieruns,08-09-20,I Want Professional Help,"Five years ago, as a 7th grader and competitive runner and soccer player, I developed anorexia. As a child I was always a little overweight, and was very self conscious about that. After naturally shedding this weight my 6th grade year and finally feeling confident in my body, I committed myself to eating more healthy. This eventually spiraled into a full disorder- I lost X pounds over around 6 months. I was sent to a nutritionist and regained more normal eating habits, but I never went to therapy to recover from the mental aspect of my disorder. Fast forward to today and I still struggle so much with my body image- I still see myself as that child athlete who is overweight. I am going into my senior year of high school now. I have fluctuating periods of feeling decent about myself and having hope in physical (as well as mental) progress towards the body I want, followed by periods of crushing hopelessness where I am constantly bingeing until I no longer want to go out with friends, do my homework, exercise, etc, essentially developing a negative feedback loop for myself that lasts for a while. I have been more open with my mom about my issues now and in the past, which was a major barrier for me to overcome in the first place. I was naive, however, to think that this would solve my issues. I want to see a therapist so bad, but feel immensely guilty over the prospect of doing so. Eating has been the center stressor of my life for a long time!

I have been a compulsive eater ever since I can remember. I didn’t know this was a disorder till recently and I’ve been having the hardest time accepting this. My compulsive eating happens regularly especially in times of high stress, anxiety and depression. Because of this college has been hell on earth and I have gained a lot of weight in the last four years. I absolutely hate how I look and have been able to get past it and actually lost a little bit of weight in the last three weeks.

Saying “why do you eat so much?”, “you just had dinner, STOP EATING”, “you need to loose weight of youll never find a husband”, and so on. Well my grandparents offered to pay me for every pound I loose and although they think they are doing well this is literally tearing me apart and pointing me in the wrong direction...

If it were me, I would definitely find all of the focus on my eating to be very triggering and not helpful in letting go of the embarrassment that I remember having about my own ED. I think you should find a way to firmly but compassionately let them know that their comments and offers are not helpful, and then give them suggestions of how to *be* helpful. For example, ""Instead of focusing on my body and food, it would be wonderful if you asked me about how my classes are going at school!"" Or whatever you *WANT* to talk with them about. Recovery and feeling good about yourself is totally a YOU journey and pressure and opinions from people who aren't professionals are not helpful. Proud of you for recognizing it, and good luck in setting some boundaries with your grandparents. <3, STP",CASACERA,"Tue,08/11/2020-10:53am",I am an eating food addict,"Can graze for X hours till my ""spasm"" I call it is over.

I'd like to think that I've outgrown my issues, but I have to admit that I still have a horrible relationship with food and have no clue how to start changing that. I am at a far healthier weight than I used to be, and I'm far less depressed than I used to be, but I still spend more time that I care to admit thinking about how I can get thinner.

Secondly, CONGRATULATIONS on realizing you want to work on it.
I think the 2 above steps are the most important ones for recovery. Once you have achieved them, the following saying applies: ""When there is a will, there is a way"".
I know money is usually a problem for several of us. But believe me, there are always options.
For example: if you are a student, you can make use of the ""Counseling Services"" of your University/School, etc.
If you work, your insurance may be of some use. I know there are some limitations, but at least, you may be able to see a therapist/phychiatrist quite often with it.
If you are an adolescent/little girl, your parents would be of great help.
If you are on your own and you do not have access to insure/school services, it is common to find some places where therapy is offered at a very reduced fee (or even for free).
You can search for mental health institutions that offer discounted service or psychology schools where therapists under training offer their services for a reduced fee.
In my personal case, I used the counseling services of my University (twice...at Uni and during my master's program) and then, at work, we have an Employee Assistance Program. Insurance does not cover therapists or pdoc's in my country.
BUT at some point, I also got help from an ED charity...
So... start by looking for something feasible for you. You can start by calling the NEDA helpline for some options in your area. But do some reasearch on your own.
I have heard of people who joined the 12 Steps program for alcoholics and used it to recover from their ED.Good luck with your search.Annet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been dealing with on and off again php and residential treatments for the past 3 years. I go thru periods of somewhat maintaince with periods of relapse. I don't know how I feel about ED tiktok yet. Like it's definitely better than the dark social media world I was into before my first treatment placement. I'm afraid to bring up looking at ED tiktok to my therapist. I'm curious if the ED recovery community sees it as a good thing or as unhealthy social media? I've had a few setbacks lately. Like a family member made me upset when eating dinner. I already had food thoughts making me upset and something happened at dinner. Instead of being able to express my feelings properly, I threw it and exploded it on the floor making a huge mess. After I cleaned it up I made excuses why I couldn't eat.

469,bedathlete,08-04-20,Fell off recovery plan and feel horrible,"Hi all, I'm new to the forum, and generally new to accepting I have an eating disorder - Binge Eating Disorder. In hindsight, I've had an eating disorder since I was probably 5 or 6 as part of emotional abuse from a parent. However, through childhood and early adulthood, I, an others around me, failed to acknowledge any issue due to the fact I was a competitive athlete. I went on to college athletics and eventually turned pro. The signs were there, but since I was exercising and practicing my sport for X hours a day, X days a week, I didn't gain weight, and actually lost it. I was eating a lot, and not healthily a lot of the time. I overate comfort food with little impacts since I was burning it off as quickly as I was eating it. After semi-retiring and dropping to semi-pro in my sport and starting law school, the ED started to snowball. At the same time, I was hiding who I was as a LGBTQ person, adding to my stress. I stopped exercising altogether except for sports practice. I started to eat comfort food every day, hiding it from my mother who I had moved back in with and eating what she cooked in addition to add to my charade. I drank a lot of X to numb my pain and anxiety from school, hiding my identity, and my body that was starting to fall apart. I was an angry person and the only thing that made me feel better was food. After I graduated law school, I couldn't find a job. My ED and depression simply got worse. A therapist put me on anti-depressants, which made me want to eat more. This went on for almost two years. I finally found a job and came out to my family with who I was, which helped my depression considerably. Yet, I was still battling my ED, that I still hadn't acknowledged as an ED. Symbolically, on January 1, 2019, I decided to do something about my body that truly was well on its way to falling apart. My back, hips, and knees ached. I had developed a heart condition. I stepped on the scale for the first time in 5 years. I am a female. When I was a pro athlete, I weighed X lbs. On that day, I weighed X lbs. with a dangerous BMI X. I went for a run. I could barely finish X minutes. I had been a pro athlete, and now I was out of breath. This was it, I was done with the way I had been living. I started running every day, X minutes at first. Between January 2019 and July 2020, I lost X lbs. and got up to running X days a week for more than X. More importantly, I admitted to myself I had an eating disorder. I drastically changed my eating habits. After going a year and a half with this new outlook, I really thought I was pretty much cured. I felt good and free. In early July, I relocated to a new country for a job. I started to slip off my strict regime. I stopped running every day and started running maybe X days a week and for less time. More worryingly, I started to feel the compulsion to eat again like I had. I binged for the first time in 18 months. I felt incredibly guilty after, but have done it probably X times over the last month. I stopped measuring out what I was eating. I know I've gained weight, but not sure how much since I don't have a scale.. I'm still running, but the eating is worrying me. I realize that maybe my plan I was on for the last 18 months wasn't exactly sustainable, but I need balance of some kind that lets me eat healthily without binging and without putting on weight. Anyways, this lapse has made me way more anxious and angry than I have been and everything feels lost. I feel like I'm back at square one,, though I know that's not possible. I'm terrified of going back to that. I'm having the compulsion to eat still and it's driving me insane. If any of you have had a similar experience and/or have any resources or tips to help me get a grip on how to get back to my disciplined recovery and figure out balance. Thank you all :)",Colander,"Tue,08/04/2020-8:49pm","Hiya,","Hiya,This is the first time I've used this site and sorry the reply is so late. The thing I would recommend you try to remember during recovery is that the path isn't clear and straight. You will ""fall off the horse"", probably a lot. And that's okay and you should never feel angry at yourself for this because as long as you get back on, it doesn't matter. Part of the issue with an eating disorder (or this is from my experience anyway) is the guilt, the struggle of one voice in your head telling you to do something and the other saying to do something else. The problem with this is, no matter what you do you find a way to beat yourself up about it. We're all beautiful human creatures who make mistakes, remind yourself you're not alone and others have been thru what you have. I hope you're doing well in these tricky times, and please do remember that food is not the enemy, it is something we simply need to get by. Allow yourself to enjoy it more and you may find you're less likely to binge. Just be patient with yourself:)",whiteblossom05,"Sun,08/09/2020-8:51pm",Similar Issue,"Personally I think the best option is to not return to your ""disciplined recovery"" since it will just continue the cycle of binging. I think easing a bit by implementing foods you find comforting here and there will prevent the urge to binge, and it's more sustainable.I'm also an athlete and during the course of the pandemic I lost it a bit too. However, keeping a solid mindset and constantly re-assuring yourself that you're doing better than before might help you pull through the aftermath of a binge.You mentioned that you stopped measuring out what you eat and I wanted to say that I think it helps. Obsessing over exact amounts of food consumption can be tiring and eating until you're satisfied is better. (I would measure and weight my food every single day and have been doing better ever since my parents hid my measuring cups and scales).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi Joemama,
Welcome to the forum! I am sorry to hear you are struggling with an eating disorder. However, I want you to know that with some time, dedication and effort, you can get better.I think you already started with your recovery process.1. You already recognized that you have a problem
2. You are willing to eat more (even if you can't).
3. You asked your mom to get you a therapistYou have been doing the right thing. So, keep going with this and ensure that your mom gets you that therapy appointment.It is easier to recover if you get some professional help. Believe me, it is not going to be easy. It will take some time. But perseverance and willingness will take you there.You deserve a life of joy!Hugs

Anyway, I am feeling physically and mentally terrible, dealing with the consequences of my eating disorder. I still don't know how to fully convince myself to jump all the way into recovery.

I wonder if you usually feel anxious about something and the way you find to calm that anxiety down is by grazing? Sometimes, when I am very anxious, I feel like eating sweet things. Practicing some mindfulness exercises (you can find them out in the internet) helps me a bit.
Other things that have helped me avoid bingeing or just eating when I should not are:
a) Postponing the binge... Urges become less and less as time goes by. Just tell yourself, you will eat all that you want within 10 minutes, then 20, then 30 and so on. Eventually, you will realize, that after 20 or 30 minutes, you just do not feel like bingeing.
Other times, I go out for a walk. Sometimes the fresh air helps me distract from my bingeing urges.
The above are just some ideas. Keep working hard on this. Things can be better.

486,Ms.Jo,07/30/2020,Not Sure What to Do Next,"This is my first time posting. I just made an account after using the hotline service and the screening tool. The screening tool told me I'm at risk or possibly have an eating disorder, which is something I've thought for a long time. I know I need to speak to my therapist and a doctor, but until I can get in for my appointment, I thought this forum might be a good idea. When I was in middle school and high school, I would go through periods of time where I wouldn't eat unless someone was watching me and I would lie about eating so people wouldn't know I was starving myself. Eventually, people starting making very hurtful comments about how I was too skinny. I still do, but especially then, I based a lot of my self worth on what other people thought of my body so I decided to stop starving myself so I wouldn't be too skinny. I started forcing myself to eat any time I had the urge to starve myself, but that just kind of replaced the problem with a new problem. That combined with some unwanted side effects from the medication I was taking led to massive weight gain. Now I'm in my mid twenties and I still don't have a healthy relationship with food. I often binge when I'm in a bad place emotionally and when I do binge, I feel so incredibly guilty. Lately, the guilt has gotten so bad that I've stopped eating again. I've never sought help for this. I understand that having an eating disorder is a very serious thing and I'm scared that I'm overreacting and I don't want to minimize what people with eating disorders go through if that's not what's going on with me. But I know I have an unhealthy relationship with eating and I know that something is wrong. I'm looking for help trying to figure out what it is. Any advice or support anyone can offer me in this forum is very appreciated. Sorry my post was so long.",Tryingtoheal,"Fri,07/31/2020-4:02pm",Professional help ,It's good you're seeing a therapist.

As of now, my diagnosis is OSFED. As you can see, eating disorders are able to change its form.If you are feeling uncomfortable due to your unhealthy relationship with food, it is time to search for help. The sooner you attack it, the better. You will cause less damage to your body and your relationships.For now and while you wait for your therapy appointment, start writing all the things you would like to get rid of. In that way, when you meet your therapist, you will clearly know what you hate about your ED. What is the type of relationship you would like to have with food?

Do not let yourself fall down into a full blown relapse. A slip is just that...a slip. Reflect on what may have triggered it, how to prevent it from happening next time and move on.

491,msnobody,06/25/2020,"Binge Eating, Food Addiction, Looking For Support","Hello, forgive me if this topic has been shared or discussed.  I am new and didn't find an option to search for previous topics.  I have been suffering from binge eating/food addiction for about 3-5 that I have recognized I needed help but probably longer before I realized what was going on.  I am food obsessed and will eat until I become almost sick.  I was able to get it under control for about a year, I got healthy, got to a healthy weight in a healthy way and then something happened where “I fell off the wagon”.  My trigger is fast food, it’s all I think about until I get it, I eat it until I can’t and then I sit around waiting until I no longer feel full and make another trip to another drive threw.  When I had stopped I felt like food no longer controlled me and it was the greatest feeling I had felt in a very long time.  I want to feel that way again but don’t know how to get back to that spot and more importantly once I get there I don't know how to stay that way.  I was seeing a therapist for about a year but made little progress specifically on binge eating.  I can no longer afford to see someone professionally for help.  I feel like if I had more support, something more like addiction help with people I could reach out to when I get the urge to or begin to binge, people that understood me that could help a lot.I am interested in meeting others with binge eating disorders and interested to hear about their received help or how they are working towards recovery.  I would love to hear any kind of information about what brought you to binge eating to maybe try to find some insight into myself (though I realize everyone is different).  Thank you in advance for any help or feedback received, looking forward to finally getting this under control, for good.",tryingtobebrave,"Thu,06/25/2020-10:47pm",Hi!,"I’ve had BED, anorexia and bulimia. I’m 27 now, this started when I was 19, and I would say I’ve been in solid recovery for about a year. Once in a while, I still struggle with the urge to binge, everything in the pantry, even things I don’t like. But something that really helps is when I feel that urge, i stop and write how I’m feeling emotionally at the time, and what thoughts I’m having, what I was doing that may have triggered the urge. If you do this consistently, you might start to see a pattern and identify your triggers. For me, it’s triggers either trauma or just stress related, anything that starts to make me feel out of control. Some coping skills I turn to instead are distraction; a hobby (adult coloring books and diamond painting help me), a book, a tv show, reaching out to someone I trust to talk about the feeling that’s leading me to binge. You’re not alone and we’re here for you!",CASACERA,"Sat,07/11/2020-12:19pm","Hope you're still here, msnobody","Rare to see the strictly ""binge eating"" post, although I'm sorry for anyone's pain, I personally need to hear from other's particularly sharing mutual experiences. My professional diagnosis has been ""food addiction"". Imagine telling another type of hard core addict ""you still have to ""do it"" X times a day. I love and eat all types of foods. I don't call anything I eat junk, because it's always good quality. I love what foods folks label healthy but my struggle continues. I was in an on line 24/7 support group (sadly disbanded),but hundreds and hundreds of women, nationwide and international as well, but with so many there was always someone there to respond instantly when you pleaded for help. For me, I have the briefest moment of choice, before the addiction takes over with an overwhelming force. But, with that connection, I could ""catch my breath"" and know that someone ""grabbed"" my hand, hears me, and shares their ""stuff' as well until that addictive propellant subsides and my upfront sensible consciousness is in charge once more. Whew.",CASACERA,"Sun,07/12/2020-8:49pm",why I get so discouraged,"I posted the above yesterday at noon. Guess this website doesn't get enough posts, certainly not re:binge eating, now included in NEDA. ""food addiction"", my curse since 13 yrs. old and can you believe it, with all the sensible effort at this my whole life, and now just turned 86 yes. Treatment and brief remissions  working et al, with all the suffering of overweight and trying not to be folks out there nada. Nothing. So much guilt. Pointless. And I know numerous women in private pain, unable to talk about this. Buying into the ""should be able just to ""do it yourself"" like it's just a ""habit"".""mind over matter""sort of thing. Sorry the lady who posted this originally and I responded never returned to see my post to her. I'm off. Nite all.",Annet,"Sun,07/12/2020-10:12pm",To Casacera:,"Wow! You are 86 and started with your ED since you were 13? I kind of relate to it, although I am 40. To be honest, I just do not plan to give up. I have been in treatment several times. Last time I started I told my therapist I did not want to be 80 and still have an eating disorder.
Will it be possible? Who knows but we can not lose hope.I think it is never too late for recovery and I do hope you keep trying. You get so discouraged because recovering gets us tired/exhausted. However, every step forward is worth.Haven't you enjoyed life much more when you have been in remission? Why not to look forward to be better every day? Eventually, you will not believe how far from the bad times you have moved on.Hugs to you. You deserve to recover.Annet",Annet,"Sun,07/12/2020-10:26pm",Msnobody,"I am glad you came to post here. I struggled with BED for a while and to be honest, that stage of my disorder made my life a disaster. I also used to go out and start buying things everywhere until I could not eat anything else. The regrets on the next day were HORRIBLE. There were days when I only ate and slept. I didn't do anything else... Weeks like that. I just want to tell you that regardless the disorder, food ends up ruling your life. It controls it.I would suggest you to get some treatment. If a therapist is not the right fit, change him/her. You need to find one that really suits your needs. It is not easy but it is possible.What helped me control my BED?1. Having my 3 meals and 1 snack EVEN if I had had a binge before during the day.
Doing this helps your body know that food is always available and that no food is forbidden. So, the binge urges start to fade away (it takes time, you just stick to it).2. Avoiding having binge food at home 3. If I was going to go to a fast food restaurant, I would go with company or would eat one normal portion and then I would go visit someone.4. Avoid eating alone. 5. Keeping my mind busy helped me. When we are immerse into binge eating we isolate ourselves to eat. So, joining some classes, workshops or simply keeping your mind busy helps. Especially when you have the responsibility to show up to a job at a certain time and you can not just miss it.6. Relax techniques7. Moderate exercise8. If after a meal I felt like binging, I used to brush my teeth and go out for a walk (with no money)9. Putting off the urges also helps. Start by putting them off by 10 minutes, then 20, then 30. Eventually, u will not end up bingeing... You can do this. Believe me. It is possible and sometimes if the anxiety is too much, medication may also give you a hand.Annet",CASACERA,"Mon,07/13/2020-2:29pm",thank you Annet,"Amazing (today's word) how many of the things you've listed are things that I do or have done. But still, how unique we all are, our own DNA, fingerprints, life history etc. even though we share much. AND, the times sure are different. I’ve never physically appeared “unhealthy,” yes but that's because I've never given up and done all positive ""stuff"", probably very familiar to you. I've chosen ""working toward"" as a category actually because before and every time I eat food my consciousness shifts. I'm not even aware that it has, until my episode is over. Then the awareness that ""I'm free"" and it's gone. But as I said in my first post I have to do this thing that I love at least 3 times a day. If I didn't love and need to do this to live , no problem. Done, overwith. So I choose the word ""manage"". Like folks manage their BP or diabetes or even bi-polar or mental conditions. (little brief history) Fine therapy ""up the wazoo"", OA 15 yrs. hospital stays twice. Right now with Covid 19 precautions and multabal other elder physical ""stuff"". Well, you get it, yes? Thanks so much for responding. CC",Annet,"Mon,07/13/2020-5:12pm","Hi Casacera,","Yes, I get it and that feeling of not knowing if I will ever be ED-free drives me crazy. I have tried too hard, multiple times and every time I hear about ""functional anorexics/bulimics or whatever the disorder is"" I feel hopeless. Because that means that somehow some of us fall down into the chronic state of the disorder.
I wished there were doctors/therapists with a ""magic stick"" that helped us get out of the ""functional/chronic"" thing.
I have no doubt many people has completely recovered. I have met several recovered men and women. The question always in my mind is: ""Will I ever be one of them?""
I hope yes but believe me, I still do not believe it (or see it close).
I am sure you understand this feeling...Just ""try to manage"" your disorder better and better every day. In all that we do there is some room for improvement and little by little you can continue your recovery.
I think life is to be lived and we only need to think/focus on food at the right times (and not all day long). I also do love eating. My eating times are like mindful moments. I am 100% focused on what I am eating, the taste of my food, its look, how my stomach feels. I do not want anyone to ""distract me"". But food is to enjoy with others, too. So, we need to reduce the priority we give to it. Hugs",CASACERA,"Tue,07/14/2020-7:34am",1 day remission as goal,"The whole medical world is so *compartmentalized. How to use *this in a positive way to achieve just one day. Did I say ""just"". This is no just when I've had very few ""remission"" days recently. So many things contribute to this that don't even mention food. Like my sleep (too short, can't wait for breakfast waking me up). Like my lack of motility in my colon causing constipation.

Anyhow, my car stopped on a DIME, saving both my classic Japanese car and myself. I am Not driving round the hood to profit from the next upcoming car collision. I love my old car parents handed down to me after my own car exploded as I was driving up the entryway to Jack London Square parking garage around 1995 or so.

Beginning 4 months ago I was supposed to be in early Menopause, according to my female Dr and she hasn't seen me since the Covid-19 began.... Is this what being Labile feels like???? I Haven't been sleeping most nights either. Exercise routine has increased, as appetite has decreased. I feel like I'm Controlling something which I am able to Control. Just got Hired at a new retail Job as well. Now working hours end 1.5 hrs later than my clothing store job at the mall, which I was placed on a FT Furlough and had to Shelter in Place until this New Job came along to get me back into the swing of working again. Feeling Anxious as I am learning new transactions at work, new rules about ages which are allowed to purchase specific products. Other job Never even made me think twice over sales like this new Rule at New Job. Am feeling like am Extra Self Conscious over my body's lack of tone compared to a few yrs ago. I need to swim and Can't until things return to Normal and Indoor Exercise becomes a Lifestyle instead of A New Thing of The Past..... I feel Horrible being Controlled and Life feel like a type of ""LaLa Land"" to me. I see some interesting types of jobs where i could work for huge social connection agency in The Big City in 1 of the Newest and Tallest Buildings I have ever seen. I am terrified of commuting on Public Transit currently as I haven't since a few yrs ago.

495,butterflygirl27,07/16/2020,so sick of feeling like this,"I’ve been going through short periods of having ed-centered thoughts and minor behaviors since I was 12 (5 years ago), but they always ended fairly quickly and only came back maybe once a year for a few weeks. But this time it’s worse. I’ve been losing weight since January and what started as healthy weight loss (eating healthy, working out frequently, building muscle, and eating in a slight deficit) turned into an obsession in March. It slowly got worse. I’ve reached all my goal weighs (I kept making them lower and lower) and now have a BMI of X but now I’m more obsessed than ever and all I think about all day everyday is losing weight. I count all my calories in and out and punish myself when I don’t and get anxious because I’m so upset that I didn’t meet my goals. If I overeat or am craving something I need to make up for it. I always go to sleep with a growling stomach but I never let myself eat anything since it’ll mess with my calorie count. I exercise as a way to give myself permission to eat and though I don’t binge I feel like I have no control over my eating and I have to do this exercise to compensate in order to lose more weight. Lately, I’ve been feeling anxious if I don’t exercise everyday and I exercise an average of X hours a day. I’ve attempted to purge after eating over my calorie allowance (I couldn’t so I exercised instead) and have tried other things a few  times but I really don’t like it and don’t really plan on doing it again. Recently I’ve just been feeling so much worse. I just feel mentally drained and sad all the time. I feel in control and out of control at the same time. I’ve also been feeling some minor physical effects which are new. I’m exhausted all the time and have been getting dizzy sometimes when I stand up. I’ve also been bruising more easily and sometimes my leg muscles just feel exhausted from all the exercise. It hasn’t even been very long (only like 4 months) but I am so tired of feeling this way. That in itself makes me feel weak because I know lots of other people have been struggling for years with much worse symptoms and I can’t even take this. I’m also scared to reach out for help because I feel so invalid and like my disorder isn’t real since in my mind it’s not super bad. I feel like I want recovery from a disease that I don’t even have.

496,disordered_sprout,07/16/2020,Want to recover,"So, I've been thinking about how the last few months have gone, and it's made me think pretty seriously about my ED. Ever since quarantine, it's all been downhill. I'm either binging (and sometimes purging) or restricting, and quite frankly, I'm sick of it. It's been three years, and I want to properly enjoy food again. For the longest time, I considered putting off recovery until I was eighteen and out of the house (my mom is.... less than supportive), or until I'm sicker, etc. But now I'm worried that by then, it'll be too late.So! Here's where I run into some problems. It's not as simple as ""Just eat"", because whenever I attempt to eat like a normal person, I feel out of control, and go into this whatever mode and binge. My ED behaviors make me feel superior, in a messed up way, and I don't want to lose that because I feel like it's all I have. Plus, I'm not sure where to start, or how to broach the subject with my parents. As I said, my mom is not very supportive and acts like I'm choosing to have an eating disorder. I had to stop seeing my therapist because we couldn't afford it, and I haven't seen my nutritionist since February because of corona. And if it turns out that I need residential, I'm not sure if my parents will be able to afford it. Anybody got any advice? Resources?",sadieelizabeth7,"Sat,07/18/2020-1:58pm",Support,"Hi! I'm sorry you've been struggling with ED recently and that your parents aren't supportive, it sounds like that has made recovery especially challenging. I remember hearing the ""just eat"" comment frequently and I know how frustrating and invalidating that can be. Eating disorders are literally mental disorders, not a choice, which a lot of people fail to understand. But just know what you're dealing with is serious and real, and you deserve real support. I think the moderators made a good point, the Helpline is great in finding resources when you're not sure where to turn! I had a friend who found a great therapist though them and I think they have a lot of more accessible/affordable resources too, so I'd recommend reaching out if you can.

Now, the tables have drastically turned. I know that I have an eating disorder but I refuse to admit it to anyone else, and my family and therapist have started to now voice concerns about my eating (or lack thereof) and how ""sickly"" ""frail"" and ""skinny"" I've started to look. I hate that it took losing so much weight for them to finally notice that I have a problem, but I'm also now terrified of addressing it or calling it out for what it is. I don't know what to do.

500,blujay1999,07/14/2020,rollercoaster of body image,"Hey,First time posting here, I reached out because it’s another evening after dinner where I feel absolutely sick to my stomach. I am not currently being treated or evaluated but I count calories, eat clean, and exercise every day. I don’t want to stop exercising or eating clean because it helps with my depression, but the obsessive food problems have gotten worse.
I was given a body scan when getting tested for Covid antibodies last month, and my results told me my BMR. It threw me off completely and made me want to eat less and exercise more. I used to make myself throw up and I’ve resorted to it a few times in the quarantine period, which sucks. I hate being in this mental state every time I socialize with dinner and drinks and end up eating more than I wanted to.
Does anyone have tips on how to stop these thoughts? I don’t talk to my friends or family or even my therapist about my struggle with food and control because it’s a part of myself I haven’t yet accepted...

501,notaneatingdisorder,07/15/2020,I Keep Losing Weight,"Genuinely asking for help here. I’ve always struggled with fluctuations in weight, and the really huge changes usually happen during huge life upheavals (which I know is not abnormal in the slightest). I gained a lot of weight in my first year of college because I was finally able to eat what I wanted without criticism, which unfortunately resulted in me feeding my sugar addiction and binge eating insane amounts of food. I ran out of food money very quickly my first semester and had to change that habit very quickly. I wasn’t able to drop back to a lower weight until my last year of college. Now I have been out of school for a year. I have finally decided what I want to do, am volunteering at an organization where I am doing fulfilling work, looking for a paying position, getting huge offers that I can’t take, and moving into a house with two of my good friends yet in an inaccessible area. Needless to say, I’ve been very stressed, and it doesn’t help that I have been regressing back into maladaptive coping strategies and mindsets after a year of being in a house with my emotionally abusive father. I first noticed my weight beginning to drop precipitously in March, but I just attributed that to stress about COVID-19 and monitored my symptoms (I may have had it at some point, not sure). At the beginning of the year, I was not exactly healthy but was at a lower weight. I had been healthfully and sustainably working out and eating decently in my last year of college, but that all stopped when I moved back home. Just to be clear, I have not been working out and do not have a history of obsessively working out. Quite the opposite, actually - I am frequently depressed, haven’t been on birth control in over a year which is making my PMDD mood swings AWFUL, may have ADHD which messes up my ability to make and stick to schedules, and my anxiety cripples all of that more. I also have hypersomnolence, which is essentially excessive daytime sleepiness. All of these things have compounded to cause me to stay in bed for much longer than I want. I sometimes only eat if I have had time to go to the grocery store in the prior week to get snacks to keep next to my bed, and when I downstairs for dinner. This also means that I don’t always take the medication I do have on time (not related to eating).I have lost a lot of weight in less than five months. It’s gotten to the point where I can actually feel the physical effects this is having on me. I do not have the option to stop working, get back into exercising, or to eat the way I want (though I certainly can eat better). I live with my parents, who had always commented on my weight when I was larger, but only my mother shows concern about how little I eat, and even then she has not mentioned my weight loss. My dad has complimented my body more frequently now than he ever has (which is creepy as hell either way). I have never experienced something this severe related to eating before. I’m not even putting everything I’m experiencing down, and this is already really long. I am used to depression-type symptoms that line up with these, but I have not actually had any episodes in the last couple of months unrelated to my period. I’ve actually had an amazing beginning to the month, work-wise. I am experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety, and I know many of these symptoms are related to my anxiety, but I am very concerned about my well-being. This weight loss does correlate with my discovery that I have PTSD, but I do not think it can be entirely attributed to that. I do NOT want to bring this up to my family. My best friend has made some comments lately that make me want to get help, but I can’t get a doctor now when I’m moving across the state next month. What do I do? None of these hotlines seem helpful, since I don’t think I can exactly attribute this to an eating disorder when it’s symptomatic to other things. I don’t think I’m ugly, I like eating food, I don’t obsess about my weight (in the sense that I think I need to be a certain weight), and though this weight loss has definitely come with me feeling more confident about my body. I experience only very very little body dysmorphia, and some of that honestly has to do with my changing eyesight. I honestly believe that, other than my eating habits, I have a healthy relationship with food. I do not feel resentful towards it, I don’t obsess about “bad foods” or want to go on a restrictive diet, and I have a good understanding of what makes up a balanced, sustainable, healthy diet. I want to be fit and healthy. None of the resources out there I can find that are online and/or deaf-friendly really seem to cater to disordered eating in particular and especially not to non-food obsessive disorderliness. Does anyone have a nutrition plan I can follow to slowly work myself back up to eating more than one meal a day and binging on junk food? Sometimes I forget that I even have it there and don’t eat or drink (hello, ADHD). Should I get tested for COVID? I don’t think I have it, but should I? I definitely plan on getting back into my workouts when I move out, but eating and meal-planning has always been a struggle with me because people verbally criticize and badger me about my eating habits. Not all of it is mean-spirited, but it stops me from learning about what my body wants me to eat. Exercising is also not going to have a great effect on me if I can’t give myself energy through proper food & am working with a weakened body. Any advice? I’m kinda sensitive to some things & have some sensory hang-ups but I am not allergic to any foodstuffs.Please direct me somewhere or give me non-judgmental advice. I just mainly need a meal plan & can’t afford a nutritionist, from which my dad stopped me from even trying to see when I was in high school.",Tryingtoheal,"Wed,07/15/2020-4:49pm",No,"we are not allowed to give medical  advice, which includes diagnosing and providing an individualized meal an.

Anyway, I have had a very hard time admitting that I have had a problem or wanting to make any real changes that would impact my life or cause me to possibly gain back fat and pounds that I had lost. I am at a point now where I know that my current weight is incredibly dangerous, and I have gotten myself eating enough that I should at least be sustaining my daily energy needs, if not gaining very minimally. However, anytime anything impacts my “plan” I feel a little bit of panic, guilt, and like I need to “make up for it” by restricting. I have been successful for about a week or two of eating along my meal plan, but if I even have something like chewing gum, breath mints, or medicine chewables, I feel really badly and either want to burn off the calories or not eat my remaining meals of the day. It is like my eating disorder is trying so hard to find any reason to wedge its way into my thinking to convince me to restrict.

Two year ago I was overweight (not so much) and the only thing that was always on my mind was that I was fat, but also I had a huge aperture and I was thinking of food 24/7. I was so depressed and I didn’t like the way I look. Then I started to take some birth control pill and that just control my appetite I don’t know why, but food wasn’t one of my priorities, I just ate whenever I feel hungry and stop whenever I felt satisfied and my weight was lower, I was happy, I didn’t exercise but I felt good.

509,ashwoodmargret,05/27/2020,going through delayed puberty now,"Hey everyone! Hope you are all doing well doing this time.Despite graduating from high school this year, I feel like I am NOW going through puberty for the first time, when all my peers have already gone through these developmental stages already. Heres's why:[1] My period - for the first time in my life my period has been consistent since September. I have gotten it every month, but for my age, it was still severely delayed. Again, one step behind in puberty. [2] To be blunt, my secondary sexual characteristics (... boobs, butt, hips) are only NOW slowly developing (people used to tell me ""YOU ARE in high school? You look like a middle schooler!"" ... eye roll? what does it matter what I look like?)[3] My hunger is rampant; I feel like a middle school boy playing sports.[4] I can be moody [5] Again, this is quite honest, but I feel ""sexual"" for the first time. Before, I would be super grossed out by romantic crushes and relationships. I felt too ""mature"" for the pettiness of high school drama. In truth, I was severely malnourished, and I did not have the mental capacity to think about relationships. This might sound silly, but I did not develop a crush until my senior year of high school! Now, I'm low key boy crazy (who would have known?) It's a super unknown feeling to think about boys so much! [6] I weight restored and have been maintaining / slowly increasing my weight for the last few months [7] My brain is more ""clear."" I am more open to recovery and challenging fear foods because my body is not AS deprived. Although, I still fear I will not get enough to eat and sometimes eat past hunger out of fear of deprivation. I also still struggle with thoughts of being fat or food not being healthy enough; I'm not recovered yet by any means. Anyways, despite being a senior in high school, I feel like I am going through what most people go through when then are 15 or 16. I feel so BEHIND, and I am terrified to go to college without fully developing. I am mature and mentally developed so to speak, but I never went through puberty until now.I am nervous when I get to college in the Fall ( ... hopefully, coronavirus permitting) I will not look and act my age. I am still awkward around boys, and I have never had any the quintessential teenage experiences like first kisses, parties, etc. I spent most of my time in high school studying non-stop, restricting my food, or attending Doctor's appointments. I am SOOOOOOOOOO excited for college and the chance for a fresh start. I also want to push myself out of my comfort zone, but I worry by mind and body resemble someone in puberty. How can I prepare myself for college given these circumstances? (My body will only develop so quickly, so I probs won't look my age until 1-2 years of maintaining or increasing my minimum healthy weight from now).In conclusion, despite becoming a legal ""adult"" this year, I feel like I am only now a teenager. The ED put a hold on my life, and I didn't develop. How much catching up can one do in a short period of time?",iwanttolive,"Wed,05/27/2020-10:49pm",ashwoodmargret,"Hi.  You wrote that out beautifully.  I will share some of my story and then pull it together to how I relate to you so much.  I am fifty-two.  I am ALWAYS told I look like I am thirty something.  I too spent most of my years in treatment and never really grew up in many ways.  I still haven't.  I lost all the things you described.  No proms, no dances, no high school experience.  No dating.  No maturing.  I first got my period when I was sixteen then not again for another year.  Then I lost it for eight years.  I am not peri-menopausal.  I missed out on all the ""normal"" things someone my age should have experienced.  I am a single adult female as I refer to myself because saying I am a woman just doesn't quite sound right even though my age would indicate otherwise.  I lost out on so much with being sick that I don't know if I will ever catch up.  I am working part time and supporting myself with help.  I am on disability and sometimes my Dad helps me when I need it.So I really understand what you are saying.  I never thought of puberty.  That seems a strange concept but I guess I went through it.  Never boy crazy or never wanted to date, marry.  I think it is great that you are getting excited about these things.  It shows real healing.No you are not fully recovered but you are on your way.  Not everyone ""looks their age"".  My father is going to be eighty and looks like he is sixty something.  So genetics can play a role.  I encourage you to just be you.  Let the process of maturing take place naturally.  This isn't something you can manufacture.  As you continue to let go of the eating disorder and find out who you are without it ( I encourage you to see if there is a counselling center on campus to help you go through this process) you will learn things about yourself that you didn't know previously.   As I said I encourage you to have a therapist if you can as you journey into freedom from the eating disorder.  I am fifty two but feel ten.  What happens when people have addictions or illness, we stay at the age when things started happening.  It is a common issue for many.  I think I may be fifteen maybe but I still think ten is more comfortable.  Give yourself time this summer to learn about yourself, what you enjoy, what your dreams are, and take some risks if you feel up to it to do some things you haven't done before because the eating disorder ""wouldn't allow you to"".
Walking away from or healing from an eating disorder is a journey, not a sprint as I say frequently.
This is your time to spread your wings and start to fly.  I am really excited for you.

And also I learned in recovery that people really do not care as much about your body as you may think. People without EDs are just not as focused on that. I think especially in college when you get to know tons of new people they are not going to focus on your body as the first thing about you. I worry what they'll think too but it's an ED thought.. people will care who you are beyond your body",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
510,silverstars,07-01-20,From Seriously Restricting To Seriously Bingeing.,"Hello,Everyone....So last week i was discharged from a general pysch unit where i spent 9 days re feeding.They didn't really know what else to do with me there.My doctor ended up referring me to a day program and insisted i email the dietician i had been in contact with a couple of months ago.
i did email her and i have an appointment with her on Saturday.Before i went into hospital,i was severely restricting,and my weight dropped very low.My pyschiatrist,who is also my therapist really wanted me checked out medically and was glad that i was admitted.i got used to eating three small meals and one snack a day,and my hunger cues came back.Now that i have been home,all i have been doing is bingeing.i have no idea HOW to eat,and i am terrified i will never stop.i am gaining weight daily and it is freaking me out.i always seem to be hungry.i feel so out of control and i cannot stand it.My whole life feels like it has changed,and i suppose it has.Things are so different since my first short meet and greet with the dietician.Will she take me seriously now?Will i really be able to have a healthy relationship with food where i am not either restricting or bingeing?i turn 45 this month.After so many years....is recovery possible?
Is it a worthwhile pursuit at my age?i'm just scared right now.",JustBryanne,"Thu,07/02/2020-2:30am",Recovery is possible! ,"Hello, friend! I am new to this as I am just now working towards recovery myself, but I like to think of things this way. Restricting is one side for a pendulum, bingeing is the other. When you swing far enough one way, your body will try to overcorrect and swing far the other way. From what I have read, binges frequently happen as a result of restricting. It’s your body trying to regain balance. Don’t give up, friend! Trust that your body will do what it needs to. Trust that healing is within your reach! Don’t be scared. You have people like me in your corner cheering you on.",silverstars,"Fri,07/03/2020-7:37am",Thank you JustBryanne,"Thank you so much for your support and encouragement,i so appreciate it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
511,Chlolouh,06/28/2020,I don’t think there is help for me ,"Hi so I’ll start off I’m a 24 year old single mum.I think my eating disorder began in high school. Usual wanting to be skinny as the other girls, not eating because I was saving lunch money for the weekend, then snacking on junk at night times. Looking back at pictures of those days I WAS skinny. I’ve always naturally been a size X when I had my son and went onto the hormonal implant I gained weight, but I lost it, I didn’t “diet” but I hit the gyms. Now I’m not overly bothered about my weight no more than any other person I mean we’d all like to change something right? My problem is just my overall attitude with food. Since my teens till now so around 10 years, I physically cannot finish whatever I am eating, I always have to leave something. I cannot eat socially ESPECIALLY at buffet type functions I feel all eyes are on me!? I just can’t do it! Even family bbqs I’ll keep myself busy so no one notices I’m not actually eating. Now I’m becoming more aware I can go days and days on end without eating. And when I do it’s always very minimal and that will be that for a few days the thought of finishing it makes me feel physically sick. So it’s not me consciously doing it, it’s subconscious.
I landed in hospital earlier this year with collapsing but I was threatened with social services if I didn’t get my diet back on track. Now I have tried the whole small and often etc tried food diaries they just don’t work. So I’m wondering if I do call the GP can they actually help? It’s like I want to beat these mental barriers I have but I really don’t see how I will be able to do that? Like it’s became so normal to be hungry to be weak that this is how I’m going to be forever there’s no turning back to a healthy relationship.",HeroCat,"Mon,06/29/2020-9:13am",I'm sorry to hear what you're,"I'm sorry to hear what you're going through. The title of your post is upsetting because there certainly is help for you and it's clear that you are at least thinking about it if you've posted here. I know it's very difficult to think about having a healthy relationship with food when you're in a place where it's all wrong, but you can get there. If it's too hard to do it for yourself, then think about your child as motivation. GPs can be helpful, but sometimes they don't know much about how to treat EDs so you may need a specialist. If you trust your GP definitely reach out, if not do some research for a practitioner who specializes in ED. You could have a medical doctor on your recovery team. Do you have a therapist? Good luck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
512,orangescrunchy,06/22/2020,Am I okay?,"Hi
I've been showing some symptoms of an ed recently and I was hoping for advice.
I count my calories everyday and if I go over my limit I work the extra calories off. I eat an unhealthily low amount of calories. I feel bad when I have a big meal, and if I know I'm going to be in a situation where I eat a lot (like a party) I don't eat a lot before hand. I weigh myself and have a 'perfect' weight in mind. I feel scared and sad when my weight goes up and happy when it goes down. I workout multiple times a day.
But somethings I do make it seem like I don't have one; I would never and have never purged, I don't feel uncomfortable about the size of my body, I don't wear baggy clothing, I don't fast, I can eat around other people, I have a healthy weight, I can eat junk food...
I'm wondering if I have a potential ed or just an unhealthy relationship with food...

515,LastOneFastOne,06/17/2020,Something has to change...Need help finding happy medium,"Feeling really lost and would love some guidance. My weight has fluctuated drastically the last few years and I’ve just received so much conflicted guidance that I’m confused what I’m working towards right now. Apologies for the long post, but think it also feels better to just get it out there. For background, I was a college distance swimmer. My ED started my senior year after I hit a plateau in my performance (totally normal but devastating to still put in the 4-5 hrs of work with no results). I moved away from a “fuel for performance” mindset and down a slippery slope of restriction and over exercising.For a year, my performance came back but only temporarily. Then I quickly got really weak and exhausted. I experienced frequent injuries, blood sugar drops and mood swings. I entered an outpatient ED program through my athletic department, but it wasn’t helpful for me. I hit my low point when I was hospitalized on our training trip and I was so afraid that I decided I needed to make a change. So I worked my ass off to recover and I slowly got to a point that I would consider “healthy.” I was also named captain, so it was important to me that I was encouraging a healthy culture on my team as well.Recovery was amazing. I had SO much energy and I felt like myself again. Laughing and happy most of the time. I experienced intense, constant hunger and felt like I could eat “normal” and could swim faster than ever. I finished out my final season and graduated college. I’ve tried really hard to carry over my healthier habits to a “normal” active, working adult lifestyle. But it’s posed a much more difficult challenge than I expected. I’m not swimming 5 hours a day anymore. I’ve drastically adjusted my diet and have stayed active but it’s just not the same. I’m the heaviest I’ve ever been and that terrifies me. I’ve completely relapsed - restricting and exercising way too much, but the scary thing is - I just keep gaining! It’s like my ED doesn’t “work” anymore. And deep down, I don’t want to be sick anymore like I was, but now I just feel completely out of control.  My family has gone from begging me to eat and put on weight to trying to help me restrict and diet, not because I’m overweight or they think of me that way, but because they know I’m deeply unhappy and they’re just trying to help me. Super long story, I apologize. But I’m just really lost and confused right now. I just want to feel in control again and strike that healthy, happy medium of everything - my weight, my eating, my exercise and my mindset. But I don’t even know where to start anymore. Any ideas? Has anyone ever experienced this and gotten over this? Have I ruined my metabolism from my lowest days of ED? Thanks in advance.",Alexo_eats,"Wed,06/17/2020-9:55pm",Hello,"I'm sorry you feel that way. Not being able to lose ____ could be your body trying to protect you.

But what she doesn't understand is she actually perpetuates the problem.

517,m1nz99,06-05-20,new to this,"i've never had a negative image of myself or my body. i loved ""junk"" food growing up. i wasn't a sporty kid, but playing outside with the neighborhood kids was a daily occurance for me, regardless of the weather. all of this changed this fall.
i had gained a little bit of weight. i was still a normal, average weight, but i didn't really like certain aspects of myself. i started looking up ways to become healthier, ways to enjoy exercise, ways to lose a few pounds. this began my spiral downward.
i had originally only loosely counted calories, and i didn't really care if i had went over the number my fitbit told me i had burned. this was in september. things slowly escalated. i began my indoor track season, and when that was over, i'd utilize my school's weight room every day. i began eating lower calorie foods, measuring them out. but still, nothing was truly detrimental, and no one had really noticed any change. when covid left me stuck at home, with no school, no friends, and no routine anymore, it became really bad. before my family intervened a few weeks ago, i had to check my apple watch activity app to make sure i was in a X calorie deficit (at least) before i ate anything. i would force myself to go on X mile runs (sometimes even upwards of this) on a basically empty stomach in all sorts of weather. all i could think about was how many calories i had burned. what i could eat. what i couldn't eat.
it consumed me. it still consumes me.
now that the weather has warmed up and i've started wearing shorter clothing, my family is horrified. i've gone to the doctor. she referred me to a therapist. but i need guidance, some sort of support from someone who understands, now.
how do i stop? how do i stop obsessing over exercising or staying active? i've cut out intense exercise, but if i don't go on a walk or bike ride or do something remotely active, i genuinely have a panic attack. also, calories. how do i just let go? how do i stop counting? weighing? measuring? worrying? how do i eat sweets again? anything would help right now. thank you.",Love1,"Sat,06/06/2020-7:32pm",Get professional help no,Get professional help no excuses,Love1,"Sat,06/06/2020-7:34pm",Help,I know I need to go into residential treatment but am afraid of php.

Often I found that I was just projecting my anger about recovery itself onto my parents who were only doing their best to help me, and that’s no good. I have no idea if that’s what’s happening to you, but I hope this at least makes sense. Maybe if you could try to just tell them how annoying their nagging is to you, and that blaming you for your ED (which is not a choice) isn’t going to help anyone.

521,untiedshoes,05/30/2020,I thought I had a problem but... did I make it up? Or do I actually have BED?,"So..
I’ve struggled with body image for a long as I can possibly remember.  There were little things I’d do to try and eat less or lose weight since I was 11 or 12 and those behaviours definitely increased significantly over time. The first time I purged I was 17, but I always just thought it was me being dramatic or a cool trick or a phase.
After leaving an abusive relationship and getting sober and moving to a new city I started making a bunch of rules to prevent myself from gaining weight - not even to lose, just not to gain.  Slowly I cut entire food groups out one by one.  I stopped taking medications because I thought they might make me gain weight (the medication is for Ulcerative Colitis so also part of me wouldn’t mind the symptoms as I lost a lot of weight from that when it was active..) I also stopped taking vitamins because I was afraid they’d impact my weight.
Then the binges started. And I hated myself.  I’d purge for hours.  When I didn’t feel like that was enough I’d take a lot of laxatives. And then I’d go back to restricting telling myself not to binge ever again, avoid food at all costs except X.My weight was technically pretty low according to the scale, but no one ever really said anything and I didn’t think I looked much different than when I started “editing” my diet to begin with.My health declined -I couldn’t think or speak straight, could barely muster up the strength to walk across the room, I was dizzy and my vision would black out and my heart felt like there were butterflies trapped inside of it.
Then my body turned on me and I just kept binging until I decided I couldn’t do it anymore, I had to try and start eating again to avoid the binges. At first it was working but now... I’m just constantly hungry. And I feel out of control. And confused and scared... did I make it all up? Is it actually BED that I need to address? It’s been two weeks and I’m still so hungry all the time, even when I’m full sometimes I just can’t stop myself. I have an appointment with a nutritionist in a couple weeks but until then... I really don’t want to go back to purging. Wtf is happening hahaha HELP",2Healthy4me,"Tue,06/16/2020-4:14pm",Hello I read what you wrote and Understand how You Feel,"My 1st binge was at the precious age of 10.Only I was also alone at home for the very 1st time, with no one in charge of me but myself.
I think once I began eating my favorite snack food I began having a blank sense about my mind and body.
I was eating a huge bag of this snack food, and by the time I had finished eating I had finished the entire bag. I hadn't planned to purge after eating, BUT I did.
I felt very embarrassed.
Then after that whenever I returned from my sport event I would replenish my Cals.
As I got older I met friends at work on fad diets, or in college I met girls who frequented the cafeteria and and then ended up in the girls bathroom after just finishing a group binge.
Like the saying goes,""Monkey see, Monkey do""
I tried this trick too, only since I didn't have tons of foodie friends, I preferred to do my RR purging in a quiet and peaceful restroom of my choice.
I couldn't seem to be able to study in the library w/o binging at my study cubicle.

522,HeroCat,06-09-20,listen,"I just need to be listened to about this. It's very difficult to actually say this to anyone, but I thought this might be a good place. I feel that my recovery of late is being very negatively impacted because I am living with someone who has recently been diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). The diagnosis alone has not made the situation more challenging, but the ""stay home, stay safe"" order has. The result has been a maelstrom of emotional and verbal abuse that is wearing me down and depressing me. I am doing some reading on the topic and trying to take steps to protect myself from it, but it is immensely challenging.

I recall at that age that many of the adults who I knew from the kids on my swim teams, or skating classes were very helpful to me. They welcomed me to go with their own kids to exercise activity classes such as tumbling/gymnastics,  Year Round AAU swimming at the local university league, bowling on the weekends and then roller skating became my year round passion. In keeping busy and having other adults who also seemed to like having me w/ their kids in the same activity classes to help babysit, or bring them back if they became off key or anxious, or any other reason to have a pre-teen nanny along w/ the kids to kind of help out where mom took off after dropping us off for an hour class here n there. I recall that participating in exercise activities kept me in great shape, and boosted my self esteem. Getting out of the house on weekends to babysit a kid from around the block or participate in a sleep over w/ my best friends was also in good fun.I think it may help the daughter,  that you mentioned, who has Oppositional and behavioral challenges,    to experience being away from your side at least a few hrs a week. Even if she visited the library a few times a month with a time and regular routine for her to get accustomed to. You could go for a nice walk while she is at the library for an hour or so. Or ask a neighbor near you who has older kids than her to invite her to participate in activities with them.Just becoming immersed in a few of her favorite sports, or social type of memberships as Girl scouts or Blue Birds could do her a world of good in learning to Individuate herself from her parents on a regularly scheduled time. You just have to do a little research online or call a local parental crisis line to see if they have any activity referrals to give your daughter some time in acclimating with other pre teens as well.Sometimes the child acting out may really have self esteem problems and the desire to separate from parents but too anxious to do so. She could work up to being away from you very gradually. That way when she is a little older she will make a transition into the teen years quite easily.I see a lot of ads for parents requesting an older teen to take their kid or kids out for a few hrs per week. They are either volunteers, or they get paid the amount that you advertise in your ad as being fair amount that you can afford per week to help you out so you will have some ""Me Time"" to work on whatever issues or things that you need time to do. The websites have ads that parents create and request  by writing a description of your needs and how many hrs per week, and what you can afford to pay for the person accepting the care taker or parent respite provider. Good Luck and I hope you may be able to treat yourself with TLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My family is the same way and I was too afraid to tell them because they have a mindset that does not support depression or eating disorders. What I will say is KEEP THE DOCTORS APPOINTMENT. You can talk to your doctor without your parents knowing or finding out, depending on your age. If you are 18 or older they do not have to tell your parents a thing and they will do what they can to get your recovery process started. That is what I did and my doctor has lead me in the right direction to get help so far. If you are under 18, you are still entitled to talk to them without your parent in the room and you can let them know it is something you want to keep between you and the doctor. Your doctor will know more about the topic than anyone else you go to and it is a judgement free zone. You are not alone, I just went through this situation and it is the best decision ive made.

I find myself harboring the very juvenile wish that I could simply add weight without having to do any of the work involved to get there.,iwanttolive,"Fri,06/05/2020-9:01pm",HeroCat,"Hi.  I saw your post and am wondering how you are doing since you posted.  I am sorry you are going through so much.  I know the feeling about not wanting to have to go through the process and just be better like that.  But it is in the process that we learn about who we are apart from the eating disorder, and the struggle helps us develop character.  It helps to strengthen us and teaches us how to have compassion for others who are struggling.  Did you ever hear of the story of the pearl?  It starts with a grain of sand caught in an oyster.  The sand acts as an irritant in the clams system.  The clam, as far as I remember, secretes stuff inside itself and tries to work the piece of sand out. What happens is that over time, the pressure, the process that the oyster goes through creates a pearl.Another example I am very fond of is the butterfly.  I love butterfly's.  First of all they represent new life in Christ for me.  The other is how one can not force a butterfly out of its cocoon before it is ready or it will die.  I wasn't ready to come out of the cocoon because the world was too scary.  But if it stays in the cocoon too long it will die.  Then once out the butterfly needs to learn to adapt to its new form and will never be able to go back into the cocoon of safety because it then becomes a place of death.  There have been many times I want to go back into the cocoon.  I was a late bloomer.  I didn't come out of the cocoon for a very long time.  I am learning to fly.  To fly in the zone of recovery.So these are just some of my thoughts.  I hope it helped some.  Please let us know how we can support you.iwanttolive",Love1,"Sat,06/06/2020-7:38pm",What is php like?

While I may not know much about your situation, for me, it always felt like I wasn't ""worth it"" to eat without exercise, that I didn't ""need it"", which of course is completely not true. We all need to eat enough, regardless of the amount that we move in a day. I remember hearing constantly how exercise is ""so important to health"" and other messages like that, which I guess is true, but left me horrified to take even a day off some kind of exercise. On some level, I still struggle with balancing what I know is best for me individually, and what health messages I'm being bombarded with constantly by the media and members of my family, but I know now is that rest is So important and so necessary for our bodies as well. I guess what made me let go a little bit was actively working to value my mental health over my fitness ability, which is really, really hard, but I know how important it was in my recovery for me to do that. So I don't know if this is helpful, as I don't have any solid advice for you, but I just wanted to let you know I understand, and am sending you so much compassion. -sadieelizabeth7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

532,FightingMyDeamons,06-03-20,Hello from a newbie,"Hello, everyone!This is my first post in this forum, and my first time posting at an Eating Disorder recovery forum. I am very happy to be a part of this community.
I have been diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa for the last eight years, which is quite some time. I have never been close to remission, my behaviours just change from time to time. At the moment I am stuck in a vicious cycle of restricting, then binging and excessively exercising. I decided to join this forum after spending the whole night binge eating. I have a treatment team- a psychiatrist, a psychologist and a nutritionist. However, I haven't been very honest with them about how much I am struggling at the moment. How do you start being completely honest with your treatment team? (This is a new team for me, we have been working together only for a month) My biggest issue is, that I am binge eating such large ammounts of food, I feel ashamed to tell them.Thank you so much for reading!",Love1,"Fri,06/05/2020-7:20pm",Never feel ashamed! Start by,"Never feel ashamed! Start by being honest only to yourself and then Pick one person you trust most from your team and be honest with them!
Don’t let the fear in your mind stop the dreams in your heart!",iwanttolive,"Fri,06/05/2020-8:50pm",FightingMyDeamons,"Hello.  Welcome to the forum.  I am glad you took a brave step in opening up some here.  I am glad you found us and that you are reaching our for support.As for your question about being honest...that is tough.  But for me, I realized a long time ago that if I am not honest with my team, I won't get better.  So, I think the first thing you need to really think about is do you want to get better, or are you afraid to get better and the process involved and the work involved.  It seems silly to ask if someone wants to get better but for me, it was in a very sick way safer for me to stay sick than it was facing the real world and getting ""better"".  I was so filled with fear, and still have a good amount of it, but that is a very important first step.  I am a Christian, I don't know if you have a faith back round but my faith and trust in Jesus has made being honest more doable.  When first really sick I lied.  I don't like to admit this but it is the truth.  I deceived, which is lying.  I did things I would never think I would do.  I learned that I had to be honest.  It takes time to get comfortable with the team, but when it is about behaviors you aren't being honest, this is really important to start from the beginning with your team. You may want to let them know you struggle with this and ask if they would ask you direct questions to make it easier to talk about.  Bringing things up on your own may be too difficult.  For me, I HAD to start talking about very personal and scary things as I knew that was the only way I would get into a recovered state.  To this day I ""tattle"" on myself.  I know that if I do something that is not good for me, as much as it may cause a higher level of care or whatever, I have to be honest.  That is me and my journey.  I don't let too much time go by with secrets.  I just can't.I learned, hear the word, learned.  It didn't happen overnight.  I wasn't always honest.  But in order to recover, you have to be honest with yourself first.  Eating disorders or any maladaptive ways of coping serve a purpose.  Being honest will help you discover the purpose and you can begin to heal.  For me, I need Jesus to help me with this journey.  Right now things are really stressful and painful as my sister is critically ill and we don't know how much longer she is going to be with us.  So I have been overeating bingeing.  If I do anything harmful I will tell my therapist even though I know she will want me in a higher level of care.  Sometimes the things we fear the most is the thing we need.So this is long.  I am always long winded.  Sorry about that.  I hope this helped a little.  Being honest with yourself first is primary.  Then let your team know of this struggle and again, ask them if they will ask you direct questions.  That may help you.  Take care.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

535,dancergirl,05/26/2020,am i sick,"hi everyone, so grateful to find a community where i can talk about this stuff and people will understand. I have had issues with how i view food and my body for as long as i can remember-- i am a ballet dancer and was never the thinnest one in the room but never overweight by society's normal standards. anyway, in high school i started really focusing on dance and i gained some weight due to puberty/growing up/being a woman/etc and i was dedicated to getting that weight off and having an underweight BMI. i never saw a therapist or even considered that this was an ED until about a year ago, and it has been 4 years since i gained that weight in high school and I am still trying to get back to the weight i was in 7th grade. it sounds crazy to type out but i that is just what i think. I am now a dance major in college and had a lot of success in the dance department throughout my first year while also counting kcals and obsessing over calories in/out, gym time, etc. and attributed all my success to the obsession. i saw a therapist once a week and starting taking meds to curb the negativity and it worked great for many months-- I stopped counting, i felt good in dance classes, and i wasn't blame every bad thing that happened on my weight. then COVID hit and i had to leave school and fly home where I don't have the reliability of the dining hall (i hate cooking), the gym access, the friendly distractions, the weekly face to face therapy, and I feel like a sophomore in high school again counting my kcals and trying to keep it as low as possible so i can impress the dance faculty by looking super ballerina-esque when i go back to school. however, i just ended my access to my therapist via my college and now i need a new one, which my school therapist is helping with, but my insurance is changing and i can't book these appointments when i really need them. so here i am. i tell my mom that i am looking for a therapist with ED specialization and she immediately says ""are you starving? i saw you eat today! are you purging? i dont think so ? do you have a problem? is your therapist being dramatic?"" and i feel completely invalidated and like i am overreacting and i could end all these ED related behaviors tomorrow if i wanted to and start a new happy life. but i know i cant and i know my mom is wrong, but insurance is leaving me with no one to help me. anyone else have experience with parents who dont understand or not having therapy available? would love any advice and sending love to everyone on the forums <3",ladym,"Thu,05/28/2020-12:41am",You will probably need an,"You will probably need an official ED diagnosis by an MD or psychiatrist to get insurance to pay for it.

I haven't seen a therapist for two weeks because of it, which sounds so weak that 2 weeks is a long time but that is where i'm at.

When I was 14 I went through a period of time where I had a really sick and restrictive mindset about eating, but I only seriously restricted for a short time before I went back to eating normally, I dealt with a lot of unhealthy thoughts but I was able to recover from it on my own and it had been years since I had a problem. I hadn't thought like that in years so a little while ago I thought there wouldn't be a problem with me losing weight healthily. I just wanted to feel good, I was cautious and I thought everything was fine. Recently I had an awakening on a weight loss forum, I was describing my goals, how I ate, and my current measurements. Suddenly everyone was telling me to get help, that I was going to make myself sick and I was being obsessive and unhealthy. I thought that was crazy so in order to prove that I was fine I decided to calculate my bmi, I was shocked when I found out that I'm borderline underweight and if I lost even a few more pounds I'd be going into dangerous territory. I'd been intermittent fasting and counting calories, I don't get how things went downhill so fast. I want to get better but I don't know how. I'm not close with my family and I'm uncomfortable with telling them, and due to coronavirus I can't exactly go out and get therapy. If it gets worse I'll definitely go to my family but right now I think I can manage it on my own. I just don't know how to switch my mindset. I've been religiously counting calories for months now and I spent almost all of my free time either working out or watching videos and reading up on weight loss and dieting. I wish I could just switch a flip in my head so I could go from everything revolving around weight loss to revolving around being healthy and happy. The worst part is that I don't want to stop, I know I need to and I've stopped actively counting calories but I was finally losing weight which is why I find it hard to believe that I really am at a dangerous point. Part of me wants to switch my focus to exercise so I can just tone up instead of restricting myself but I know I'll just as easily become obsessed with that. But I've been learning about intuitive eating and I think that may help me learn to take care of myself and make me less afraid of food. I guess I really just need some support because I'm determined to get better.",ladym,"Sat,05/30/2020-4:18pm",Finding support,"I am new here too. But the resources section here on the NEDA site has been very helpful. Also, ANAD is doing virtual online/telephone support groups.

Instagram (which I am new to) and NEDA are doing live meal support every two hours and some other support stuff (link on the NEDA page). There are a few helpful support groups for ED on facebook as well. I struggle with restriction too. When I started I, too, just wanted to lose weight in a healthy way. But I was soon obsessed with calories and skipping days without eating. Now I can't eat at all. Am just coming out of denial that I have a problem. Am reaching out for help, and have been told that's the major first step. SO good for you for having the courage to post here and seek help before it gets worse.

540,FireflyGhost,05-12-20,My First Time,"I am not quite sure how to start this, as I’ve never actually put into words what I’m going through. What I have gone through since I was in junior high, close to 15 years ago. It scares me to even share these words with an online group of anonymous strangers, but I figured I had to start somewhere, and this seems like a good place to do that.
I am bulimic, and I have been for the majority of my life.
I still remember the first few times I made myself purge after I ate too many after school snacks. I was afraid of all the new weight my body was gaining once I hit puberty. I was always the skinniest girl I knew, but then I started to get hips and my butt was getting “chunky,” and I was afraid of the way my thighs grew closer together. I ate a box of snacks I found in the kitchen and then purged it.
Now I am 27 years old. I just got home from a food run and I am filled with shame and fear. I am scared that my whole life will be absorbed by this demon. Food is all I think about. I wake up thinking about the hunger, the fear of that hunger, and the shame from the hunger I fed the day before. I am either obsessing about food, bingeing, or purging. Then I just wait to start the cycle over again. I feel isolated, too ashamed to even seek help. I am a master’s prepared nurse, I should know better than to let the very thing that is meant to keep us healthy and strong destroy me. I spent all night googling treatment options, but I am currently still more afraid of being exposed as a bulimic than I am of suffering through this hell for the rest of my life. It has already taken my adolescence, my college years, my early 20s. I used to binge and purge out of hunger and fear of gaining weight, but over the years it has evolved. I am an emotional eater, and will eat to the point of physical pain when I am stressed, sad, or just plain bored of sitting with my own thoughts any longer. Then I purge to release the discomfort, and the fear of hating my body.
So here I am, putting these words out into the universe for the first time. I know this will not cure me, but it’s time I start somewhere. I admire all of you for being so brave. You are stronger than you even know, because you have gotten further in this journey than I have in the past decade and a half. I don’t really know what I am expecting from this. Maybe to feel less alone in my disorder, to feel a sense of unity, or possibly some wisdom from survivors.

One thing I did that might help you as a starting point is trying to write a pros and cons list about working towards recovery. What are the pros for trying to combat it? What are the cons?

Like you, I have been struggling with various forms of ED since I was about 14 and I still do many years later. I have immense shame and guilt that I have a husband and 2 children (13 and 17) who love me and yet I continue to engage in harmful behaviors. Sometimes I spiral into thinking that I must be selfish to not have recovered. I worry about the possibility of not seeing both kids graduate from college. I sink into self-hate that way. However, I can only continue to fight and joining this forum was a way for me to broaden my battle against the ED and try to pursue recovery.

541,nocturnal,05/23/2020,can i get help if my issues aren’t severe?,"Hi!
I’m 22 and have struggled with body image and my relationship with food for as long as i can remember. There were points in junior high/high school where i restricted my eating fairly severely and managed to get to a pretty low weight. at the time i was obsessed with numbers on the scale and calories. since then, i learned to not weigh myself. i know if i do, i will spiral and go down that path again of competing with weight/calorie intake of the previous day. I’m now at a place where i eat normal-ish amounts i think. but anyway, with quarantine ive had a lot more time to think about this. i always feel fat and i’m obsessed with food. i feel guilty after i eat anything. i mostly hide when i’m eating (i don’t binge). i worry that i’m spending my youth being fat when i could just lose the weight and be pretty while i can be. i know i’m not fat, but i’m not thin either. i manage to eat a fairly normal amount now (it’s probably not enough still) because i can distract myself with the thoughts by watching tv while eating, until the guilt comes when i’m done. i cried for a long time tonight because i feel like i ate too much today (i ate two meals when i usually eat one with snacks).   i’m tired of being obsessed with these thoughts and the fact that i’m going to be obsessed with these things for the rest of my life overwhelms me. i know these are very minor issues compared to most. i don’t feel like it’s bad enough to get treatment or anything. i don’t have any physical symptoms, i’m not scarily thin, i don’t binge or purge. it just makes me feel guilty and bad and sad daily. i’m just wondering if this is enough to get help and get better some how. sorry this was long.",justagirl,"Thu,05/28/2020-11:10pm",I hear you. ,"If it is any consolation, you are not alone with these feelings.

I didn't become sick until my twenties, so everything was normal until then. But as I got older and lost more weight, my periods became harder and harder to deal with. Then I went on birth control in my early thirties (I'm 38 now). It made me bleed less but I still had cramps and bloating. A few months ago, I stopped the pill because I learned from research that it can cause leaky gut and GI problems. And vitamin deficiencies (which I've corrected with supplementation). And now my normal periods are back and in addition to the normal PMS symptoms, I now have painful ovulation too. It's like I can feel every little thing that happens in my uterus and every little thing wrecks my digestion. I can't eat during my actual period because of the awful bloating. My bowel function gets disrupted (which I've read is normal). I feel like periods may have been a big contributor to me developing eating issues in the first place.

I haven't been diagnosed by a professional; in fact neither my primary care doctor or my psychiatrist know that I have these issues at all. I recently got back into trauma therapy, and absolutely love my new therapist. But we've only had a few sessions, and they've all been over the phone.

544,iwanttolive,05/28/2020,m_a_a,"Hi. Have you made any headway in learning about who you are apart from the eating disorder?  This is a very important step in being able to begin to let go of living in that identity.  It takes time and healing.  As for your question, I am no expert by any means but I think it might be better to separate out what you do for a living and finding out what you enjoy doing for fun, recreation, learning about who you are again.  This isn't to say the two are mutually exclusive as they may overlap.  I sometimes, more at one time than another, still wish I had the anorexic body.  But I KNOW that this isn't who I am. I am first a child of God.  That is my identity.  Body image needs to take a bow to that.  But it isn't always easy when trying to live in a body that is at a higher weight than it has ever settled at before.  I have to bring myself back and remind myself that I was dying before in more ways than just physically.What do you think about this?  Is there any other way I can try to support you?  Are you in therapy now?  My best to you.iwanttolive",m_a_a,"Thu,05/28/2020-10:02pm",Thanks. I've been in and out,"Thanks. I've been in and out of therapy over the years but just decided this week to see someone new who deals with OCD because I think that is an issue of mine as well. My theory is that being obsessed with my body resulted from not having something else in life to distract me (like a career, sense of purpose). It's a coping mechanism. And if I could find that sense of purpose, it'd help things. I may be oversimplifying here; there might be other variables too. But what you say makes sense. Spirituality is always good too.

545,marmi26,05/16/2020,Realizing there’s a problem,"So I’ve been suffering from disorganized eating for years, since I was 8 years old. Most of it stems from childhood depression that i still carry with me. I was getting overweight this past winter, and i am typically a very athletic person. I enjoy working out and eating fairly clean when i can, but when i go unchecked i tend to control everything from my intake to multiple workouts for hours, to even controlling others diets and workouts. I try to never let it get to the point to where im controlling others habits anymore but it has happened multiple times before. I know this is a problem and i usually just work on it by myself and get back to a place eventually where i can somewhat eat normally but then i feel guilt. Eventually I start thinking that i am overweight again and then the cycle begins again. Since Ive obviously been pushing down the issues and not actually working on them, i think its time to ask for help. Last night was really what made me realize. I binge ate so much crap, my younger brother was hanging out in the living room and he noticed i was gonna throw up so he helped me. He held my hair, brought me water, even took me to bed after. For reference, I am 21 (soon to be 22) and he is 12. I should not be having a child take care of me like that, its unfair and irresponsible.

I am sending you so much compassion during this scary time, and I again I'm sorry that you are going through this. I hope you know you are not alone in this, and that you find the support you are looking for and deserve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
547,silverstars,05/23/2020,Dietician Got Back To Me.,"Hi all.
So last month i contacted the only dietician i could find in my city who will work on a sliding scale.
We exchanged a couple of emails,she described her experience,and i felt good about her so i agreed that i would like to work with her.She didn't reply to me and i didn't follow up like my pyschiatrist/therapist wanted me to do.Just before i contacted this dietician i had an amazing session with Dr.S where i hung up the phone feeling so...positive so motivated about recovery.i wish i had written down all he had said.My starved brain has no recollection,and that positivity and optimism is gone.So anyway,last night i got an email from the dietician asking me if i would like to have a meet & greet session over the phone.
i haven't gotten back to her yet.i'm afraid to.The eating disorder is so pleased with me right now.Losing weight rapidly.Can't stop.""Don't want the help.Need to hang on to this because i have nothing else.This is the only kind of success i will ever know.i am not worth taking up space.i must be small.i don't want recovery.i give in. i give up.i am middle aged.Is there even any point in my striving for wellness at this stage of my life? Am i not anything more than chronic?""
And on and on and on and on.i feel so desperate.
Will you please help me to find even one reason to connect with the dietician??",iwanttolive,"Sat,05/23/2020-11:10am",silverstars,"Hello fellow sojourner,  Your post touched me so.  I am so sorry that you are feeling so, so badly.  That you don't believe you are worthy of life.  That the eating disorder voice is so strong.  I want you to know that I am 52 and struggled for the better part of my life.  I didn't think recovery was possible or if I wanted it.  Fear of everything.  Fear of living.  Fear of being independent.  So much fear.  I thought the eating disorder would keep me safe.  It doesn't.  It only destroys.  It only takes from us.  Takes us.
I wonder who has told you that you don't deserve to take up space.  That you are too much.  I know for myself those are the messages I heard and still hear.  While  I am not fully recovered, I am so much better than I was and I find relative freedom in my food choices.  I am no longer underweight and while I sometimes wish I were, I realize how much freer I am without the eating disorder voice controlling me.  Yes, it is worth fighting for no matter how long you have struggled or how old you may be.  Recovery is possible.  I had to pray to Jesus to help me to be willing to be willing to be willing to want to gain and stay at a healthy weight for my body.  I don't really like it sometimes but I do like that I am not afraid of food anymore.  Somewhere along the way someone must have told you the things you are believing.  They are wrong.  God is the Author of life.  He planned you before the foundations of the world, before they even came into existence. He planned you.  You are not a mistake even if you are told that.  God saw your unformed body before you were.  I think the fact that you posted here asking for a reason to contact the dietitian shows that you want to have permission to call her.  I give you that permission.  To have the permission to take up space.  I know that I as I said often feel I get the messages that I am too much.  But that isn't what God says and I need to listen to His voice more than the voices of anything or anyone.  Even my own voice.  Since you had such a positive session with Dr. S. would you be able to ask him/her to give you highlights of what was discussed and then write them down so you can remind yourself of reasons to live, to fight?  Also, if you could record the sessions that might help you, or take notes during sessions.  I know my memory is really bad and my Mom goes with me to appointments for medical reasons where she can be my ears and remind me of things that I don't remember so the doctor gets a better idea of the picture.  I have some serious memory struggles happening now where I don't remember doing things that I am told I am doing.  Get lost easy.  Can't find things.  I have a part of my brain that didn't form correctly that causes these problems but malnutrition will definitely cause memory difficulties.  One reason:  I think you want to contact her.  I think you are afraid and believe the only thing you are good at is being sick.  You may wonder who you are without the eating disorder.  That will come after you stabilize and your brain is working properly.  You will begin to find out who you are.  Apart from the identity of being sick.  I know this seems unattainable.  That there isn't anything. But if it happened with me, I believe it can happen for you too.  It takes a lot of work.  Painful times of grief.  Yes, you will go through a grieving period as you begin to step out of the sick role into the new role.  But it doesn't happen overnight so you will have time to adjust.  It is a journey, not a sprint and for a very good reason.  If it happened overnight, it would be too fast to be able to adjust to and you need time to figure out what or why you need to cling to the eating disorder so much.  Digging beneath the surface to the lies you believe and why.  I am so sad right now thinking about you and what you are believing and feeling.  I was there.  I wanted to die, all the time everyday for years.  Now I want to live and I never thought I would ever pen those words but it is true as my username states...iwanttolive.  It is because of my faith in Jesus and His love for me that has helped me get to this point as well as the love of my parents.  Things have been especially difficult for me in recent months because of my living situation and problems with my roommate and my sisters illness.  Also the fact that my sisters don't involve me in their lives.  I am also facing the loss of the closeness of my parent's especially my mother, as I have been writing about.  But that doesn't change who I am, my purpose, my identity.  For so long, I too thought my identity was in how little I weighed.  But that was a lie.  I am first and foremost a child of God.  Jesus tells me in the gospel of John that I am God's friend.  That is my identity now.So for you, connecting with this dietitian will give you the support during the refeeding  process.  She will help you gain safely.  She is trained to know how to help support you.  It is very difficult to do this alone.  Having a team will really help you in so many ways.I know this is so difficult.  But I can tell you from my experience, there is life after an eating disorder, or even in the process of recovery.  Yes there is a point to working for recovery even in middle age.  There is more years ahead of you and I understand what it feels like to be 52 and feel twenty plus years younger that my age because of being ill.  I lost out on so much and so many experiences.  I am single, no boyfriend, no children apart from my canine baby.  I will end here but encourage you to still post and if you have any questions and want to write back I would be more than happy to help support you. You ARE worthy.  You ARE valuable.  You DO DESERVE to take up space, regardless of who is telling you otherwise.  You ARE loved, buy the One Who created you.  Again, you are NOT a mistake.I say all of this with love and concern.

I also understand the guilt about misusing and for me abusing my body.  One thing I know about God is that He understands.  He knows the whys.  Why we do what we do.  He is compassionate and full of mercy.  When we go to Him and ask for forgiveness it has already, past tense, been given to those who call Him their Lord.  There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus our Lord.  Romans 8:1So  keep up the work and take it one day at a time.  He helps us carry the heavy load.

Last night my 24 yr old son said Mom you look sickly skinny. Are you ok? I was like I do? I’ve heard this for years but when my son said it I really heard him. He doesn’t say stuff to me like that. He kept saying are you ok? So I got it and am admitting I’m still have an  eating disorder that’s gotten worse again. In my 20’s I was in Overeaters Anonymous and therapy. I married older, had kids and now at 63 I’m sickly skinny. Marriage and parenting have triggered so many issues that perhaps food is my control but I feel it has to do with my body image and my childhood. I have worked on my relationship with God being my loving father. I realized childhood trauma was affecting me and I’ve been in ACA for almost a year. I have to tell my therapist I am not eating very much. My husband can be very mean and grouchy which hurts me deeply. Our relationship has affected our sons. I Get paid to take care of my 86 year old mom two days a week because We need income. It is very emotionally draining for me just being around her. I want to live and I’m scared. I know God gives me the strength and I feel overwhelmed with another thing to fix. I’m relieved to admit I’m struggling. I want to give up also and I’m inspired by your posts even though part of me says I’m too old!

If we delve deep enough,or even if it is obvious,the toll that the stresses of life take on us certainly will fuel the eating disorder.i am so sorry for the trauma you went through as a child.i struggle with PTSD on top of everything else from things that happened to me.
i am glad you are in a 12 step program,and i hope it is helping you.i tried to find an eating disorders anonymous group but there are none in my city.i am sorry as well that your husband is not supportive at all,and is unkind.That must make you feel very alone in this.i am so glad you reached out here.There are many really supportive people here,and it helps to have a place to vent and receive support here.It was very brave of you to admit you are struggling.That can be a difficult thing to do.But living in isolation only causes the ED voice to get louder and more controlling.Eating disorders thrive in isolation,which is absolutely something i have discovered.i am so glad you are finding strength in your faith in God,this helps me every single day.You are never too old to recover.This is something i have had to remind myself time and time again as my 45th birthday is coming up,and my disordered eating began when i was 11,and i am still really struggling.It got really out of control in my 30's.It is very brave of you to admit that you are struggling.It is so easy to get stuck in listening to the eating disorder voice which,at least for me,tells me i am too old to recover and that restricting is the best way to cope with everything that is so difficult and trying about life.Please keep reaching out here,writing about it where people understand is so helpful.
And please don't give up,even if we don't always feel it,i need to believe that there is hope,and my faith is where i derive that hope and strength to keep going,keep trying.Please take time to nurture yourself with good self care.i think that this is so important.So glad you are here.It was a brave step to take and i hope it has helped to just write it out.Please take good care,and do take comfort in taking God's hand to guide you.
Even if we feel all alone in this,He never deserts us.Offering you gentle hugs,and support,Acceptance.

548,sportygirl,05/25/2020,"Hi, ","Hi, Some of you might remember me from last year. I've been away for a while since I really felt bad, but I was too much trying to help others rather than doing anything for myself. I was struggling with a lot of things. Now I have a numerous of diagnoses (finally) since last December, I still am waiting for treatment. Sometimes it seems like nobody wants to help. I applied for treatment February 2019 and am going back and forth in two treatment centers (both for something else) and nobody seems to want to start treatment, or is unable. The waiting lists here (Holland) are too f* long. I feel almost like I have to fix myself, even after I realized I can't do that I have to since it might take another 6-9 months before I can get any treatment, and even then it won't be for eating disorder most likely because the treatment center for that want's me to work on the other things first. It all sounds logical, but I am sick of waiting and waiting and not doing anything. Today I found out that I can't go for treatment for ED even though last month they specifically said I could. Everyone seems to say something else and it leaves me nowhere. Now I am thinking of trying to diet again (I have BED/Bulimia combo) and at least trying to eat somewhat healthy instead of only eating the sugary crap I do now.",iwanttolive,"Mon,05/25/2020-2:19pm",Hello sportygirl,"Hi, welcome back.  I am so sorry you are finding no help or support for what you are going through.  I am glad you came back and reached out here for support.  I wouldn't worry too much about not being able to offer feedback to others as right now you need to be supported.  When you are able to, you will.  It is very challenging to recover on your own, but have you looked into the resources NEDA has during COVID?  They offer free support groups online virtual.  It isn't ideal but it is helpful.  I am encouraged that you are sounding a bit of hope and that you are not giving up and want to recover.  Just a caution, even NEDA will say that diets don't work.  Eating balanced meals is the better route to take.  Even if one needs to lose weight, diets usually don't work.  I know you said you have struggles with binge eating.  If you restrict too much it sets you up for binging.  Anyone for that matter.  So, I hope that you are able to get support for your other issues and maybe they can help at the same time with the eating struggles.  I don't know though.

I have had the same issue more/less. What you can do is ofcourse just eat eggs & toast for breakfast. It's a great and nutritional breakfast. You might even add some vegetable's or a piece of fruit on the side. Or even without that it's great! I know the feeling of not trusting your body to know when to stop, but also haveing a lot of hunger during the day can trigger those binges. There is only so much you can stop by your head. If you're really hungry you kind of need to eat. But what kind of hunger is it? Is it physiological of is it because you  really ate too little? If you ate too little, you can try eating some (white)fish or meat. Those foods usually don't trigger binges, but are satisfying and good for your body. I hope this helps a little. Let me know if you can work with this or are in need of something else, and if so, can you narrow it down a bit.

As a child I was always eating X calorie snack packs rather than the tasty lunches that my friends would eat at the lunch table, and bringing salads rather than a sandwich. While in college I let myself go father than I ever had and I struggled to maintain a weight that I was comfortable with. From binge eating to not eating much at all, I went through all of it. I have tried every diet and fad diet under the sun hoping to lose weight. After trying every fad diet possible I joined another diet where I found ""success"" and lost X pounds. I tracked my food and felt like I was doing something good for myself. After graduating I found myself struggling with my self image again and I have been stuck in this same hole for the past two years. Even though I am at at a healthy weight I just look at myself and know that it is not as perfect as my mind wants it to be. I am ashamed to even admit this. I can't get away from the scale and even a small change will make me not want to enjoy with my family. I decided to start working out every morning as a way to hopefully boost weight loss and it has got to a point where I don't even enjoy working out. The number on the scale is my biggest fear and I am looking for suggests on how to get away from that. I can't get myself to stop.

555,hearthurt,05/16/2020,Food is my relationship,"I'm a relatively good looking and sociable X lb woman who began overeating when my mom died (I was fifteen.) I slowly put on weight until 20 years later I weighed Y, at which time my boyfriend of 14 years left me for a thinner, younger woman right as we had decided to have kids (which did not happen.) Sorrow and grief initiated a large weight loss in about 2-3 months; I was barely eating and running 5 miles a day. I slowly recovered and found a desk job with a long commute, and began gaining weight back. I was diagnosed with Bipolar II two years ago, and over the past six years have gained the weight back and more. I eat huge amounts of calories all in one sitting at night after barely eating during the day. I am lonely as heck, but have not been able to pursue any romantic relationships due to extreme body shame. I feel like my moms death, lack of support from my family afterwards, and the trauma of losing my partner to someone thinner have combined to make this huge hole in my heart, which I can only fill with food.

556,khanhp,05/14/2020,Trigger foods,"For the past three days I’ve been overeating and trying to purge. I haven’t eaten this food in so long, it always tastes so good with the first few bites, but the more bites I take the more addicting it gets. And when I start feeling sick, the taste and the feeling of having the food in my mouth gravitated me towards having another bite. Until it doesn’t even taste good to me anymore, but I keep on eating it because I want to experience that feeling when I first ate it. But then I was disgusted with myself. Disgusted for even letting such disgusting empty calories reach into my body. Even more disgusted for it to destroy me all over again. And so I purge. And during those moments I would tell myself that I’d never it or any other sweets like this again. I’m so done destroying myself. Every time I purge I promise myself it was gonna be the last time. But the last time doesn’t seem to exist because I can’t control myself around this type of food. But the first thing i think of when I wake up is food rather than exercise. disgusting. It disgusts me. I disgust me. I hate myself. I hate my body. I hate it. I’m trying to get stronger but I don’t know how to start. I know weightlifting is good but I’ve never weight lifted before and I don’t know how to start. I hate this world. I feel so alone even though every way I turn I see my family members.

557,LanACDC,05/15/2020,Hi. I'm new and had a question about intermittent fasting. ,My current therapist is not an eating disorder specialist and she recommended fasting to me. When doing my research I keep getting conflicting messages that it's healthy and the other side is saying it's a dangerous diet fad that fuels and causes eating disorders. Who the heck am I supposed to believe?? Should I confront my therapist about giving me this advice?,iwanttolive,"Sat,05/16/2020-8:24pm",LanCDC,"Hello and welcome to the forum. I am wondering why your therapist suggested fasting?  I am not a problem professional but from everything I have been taught and know, anyone who is dealing with any form of an eating disorder usually is a set-up for more behaviours. It is usually best to work with a dietician if possible if only for a few sessions so they can assess your situation and caloric needs and a weight that is best for your body. Everybody bodies are unique and requires different nutritional needs. I know from personal experience fasting was a behavior for me and made me weak and set me up for binging. As a Christian fasting is used in conjunction with prayer, but it is always mentioned that if anyone had medical needs to consult their doctor.  Fasting for me is not done through food but every once in a while I fast from negativity or complaining of something I enjoy and use this time to pray or grow closer to God.  I know even in.My recovery fasting is not an option. Our blood sugar drop and we may get overly hungry. It can strengthen the voice of the eating disorder as well.  This is not so much medical advice but what I learned through my years of suffering. Back to your therapist and their suggestion for fasting. Do you know why?  What are your thoughts on this?
Please keep posting.  Welcome again and I hope I helped in some way.iwanttolive",LanACDC,"Mon,05/18/2020-10:52am",I felt like she wasn't giving,I felt like she wasn't giving me very good advice.

558,silverstars,05/16/2020,Daunted....,"Yes,daunted,anxious,depressed.Struggling.Really really struggling.
i managed to do what my pyschiatrist who is also my therapist asked me to do which was to call my GP and get him to order blood work and an ECG for me.So i did that.And he told me to increase my calories.
Then i talked to my pyschiatrist yesterday and he agrees i should increase my calories.He told me there is a big difference in how i communicate and tolerate overwhelming emotions when i am restricting than when i am doing well.i recognize this.i know my mood could be elevated if i would eat regularly,my cognition would be better.i just cannot seem to make a change.
i am too afraid.And i am absolutely addicted to the scale.i don't know if i can give it up,but it is insane how many times a day i weigh myself.My OCD tends to work in tandem with the eating disorder,so this is just one more compulsion i have.The very idea of getting rid of the scale terrifies me.
i know how dramatic that sounds,but the feeling really is much bigger than me.i just can't seem to challenge myself and treat myself with any amount of compassion.
My world is so small,i am miserable in this.i do not have a rich and colourful life.i think i have stopped even believing my life could actually change.This could be the depression talking i know,but also that the ED wants me to give in to it,promises me comfort and distraction.
But in reality i know it's intention is to destroy me.
Perhaps personifying the ED is detrimental to my ever truly recovering,but it just makes sense to me.
So they tell me to increase my calories and to get out and take a walk everyday but i can't seem to accomplish either of these things.
i have moments where i am baffled by,and resent my depression and anxiety for being so debilitating.It does occur to me that if i was eating well and not losing weight i would likely feel at least a bit better.i would be able to fight harder.But i can't seem to make a change.i don't really know if i am making sense (i question this all the time) here,but i hope it was ok to just get this out this morning.So lost.",Mar-26,"Sat,05/16/2020-11:42pm",hey,"I'm trying to say this gently, but there's pain in recovery. I have no idea how bad and depressed and anxious you're feeling, I have no idea how the depression and anxiety and OCD is affecting you, but I know that, as you suspect, eating more will do some good in dragging you out of this hole of negative emotions. My family just recently told me how hard of a person I was to interact with during the worst parts of my ED, and that now in recovery I am so much happier and lighter.

What do you think you need? What is causing you to have so much sadness today? I know you have been having a lot of troubles with your sister and your parents and therapy and suffering with the eating disorder. I really do understand how horrible it is to have an eating disorder, and to have family not understand. I started off probably at your age and suffered for a very very long time. I know understand how isolating and how despairing it can be. I also know that there is freedom and that there is recovery and that there is hope. I know. If you get the right kind of support that the chances of you getting better are better. Do you have a faith background? Or do you have a church that you belong to? If so,  are you able to talk with someone and get support?  I have seen and heard how much you have been struggling. I wish I could make it better for you.
How can I or how can we help support you in the best way possible? Are you in therapy anymore? Is it helping? If you're in therapy are you able to be honest and not be afraid to be honest? I know for myself being honest was very difficult and is very difficult but I know it's necessary. I know how scary it can be to be honest for many different reasons. But it's your best chance at recovering. You may have many different reasons and fears about being honest, but it is really your best chance for recovery. No it's not easy.  But it just might be the thing that helps to set you free. Believe me I have to do the same thing so I'm not just saying this I'm trying to let it and it's not easy.

561,jenny2,05-12-20,i need help,"Hi, I have never written on something like this before. I'm not sure if I will get any responses but at this point i feel like i have no choice but to try. Im 18 years old. I have had body image issues for a long time but was always too distracted with college and sports to ever really focus on it. As i started living at school and comparing myself to my teammates and other people, I noticed i started to become obsessed with small things like looking in the mirror and weighing myself. I found so much pleasure in ""morning skinny"" and not being bloated that I decided to change my calories and workouts and have started some other ED habits. My moms birthday was the other day and they wanted to get take out and I about had a panic attack trying to track down the lowest calorie item on the menu. At first I lost a lot of weight and my goal was achieved of having a consistent ""morning skinny"" but i find it to fluctuate. Some weeks i'll look really thin but other weeks i will bloat and I wont know why. it frustrates me and it only encourages me to eat even less. I don't want to stop either because I fear going to a healthier calorie per day lifestyle and eating more than I do will result in me gaining weight. My mind feels so messed up from this and I feel like its going to last forever because i know my metabolism is so messed up that if i ever do try to eat a healthy amount of food, I will gain weight. I guess i just wish i was like the skinny girls with a fast metabolism that don't have to worry about eating and gaining weight. My parents don't believe in these things because they have a mindset that if you have a roof over your head, you should be happy. I just don't know what to do and am too scared to seek help. I feel like i'm not skinny enough to be taken seriously about my eating disorder. I fear people will think I want attention, I fear everything.

564,Koyaa,05-08-20,My relationship with my body rant,"This is my first time posting on a forum and my first time speaking about my eating disorder online. Before social distancing was set I was diagnosed with an eating disorder about a year prior. I am still learning about it to this day. I started seeing a therapist and thought all was going well, but I noticed that I reached a certain point in recovery and I just couldn’t seem to go any further. It was like I was stuck at this point. I was afraid of making the leap and fully embracing my body. I was afraid of what would come from it and by this I mean weight gain. My weight has always been a problem of mine. I was mocked for my weight by my peers at school and family members for years. So it has always been something that I grew to be ashamed of. I saw this therapist for about a year, but since my university does not offer long term therapy I had to end my sessions with my therapist. I also knew that I stopped making progress in my recovery which I think was another reason for ending our sessions. She stated very clearly that she wanted to seek long term therapy through my insurance. I agreed, but it has been about 4 months since our last session and I still haven’t made the call to seek a therapist through my insurance. I know why I push it off. I am afraid of going through the process again. I am scared of having to say that I have an eating disorder and I am afraid of getting better. With getting better that means I will gain weight. I know that it is not the end of the world, I know that deep down. It is hard for me to see myself gain weight and be happy. During social distancing I think that my progress has regressed further. I feel that I constantly find myself starving myself, I get sort of happy when I feel my stomach growl. I know that I am hungry, but it makes me happy in a way that I am able to starve myself. See what I mean is that there are times when I fail to starve myself, I give in and eat. So, being able to starve myself at the moment makes me feel good even though deep down I know it is wrong. Today, my mother said that it looks like I have been losing a lot of weight and she thinks that I am purging. I am not, I am starving myself. I limit my intake of food of which I find particularly easy to do at the moment during this social isolation. I have to admit that hearing her say that I look like I have lost weight makes me happy, it makes me feel successful in a way, but also worried. I feel that now I forsure can't gain weight. I don’t want to face the comments from my family of “oh you look like you’ve gained weight again,” or “what happened you were doing so good.” I am afraid of these comments and how I will take them. I wanted to rant a little to people who may experience the same or similar feelings. I know these thoughts are not progressive and may end up doing more harm than good. I guess I hope to find motivation during this time to not indulge in my thoughts to restrict eating.",khanhp,"Wed,05/13/2020-7:30pm",replying toMy relationship with my body rant,"hey kora. I know you're scared of gaining weight. But you should know that your weight does not define who you are. It doesn't show how kind or friendly you are. It is not you. It is not a failure when you have eaten food, or too much food. You are supposed to eat when you feel hungry. Because that is a way of surviving. Eat food so that you can get strong, and spend time on other things you want to do with your life. Change your life, so maybe you can change others'. And what to do with your family's comments, every time they make a comment that is probably triggering you, you tell yourself, ""I am making good progress, I am gaining weight, and that's a good thing, because I'm working on being my best self. They don't know me as much as I know me."" I'm having such tough times with body image too. I really hope you get through it. and if you need anybody to talk to, we can communicate through this web or instagram or anything.

565,littlebylittle,05-09-20,Needing Support with Weight Gain,"Very recently I finally decided to quit my extremely low calorie diet and attempt to eat normally again. I had been restricting for a long time and I had lost some weight. I was never really ""overweight"" (which I am not trying to say that in a negative way), but I was a little chubby and all my friends and family were much thinner and I felt really bad about myself. Like I previously said, I ate in a significant calorie deficit for a long time and I became very thin. Although I finally looked ""good"" according to my standards, I felt very sick and unhealthy and decided to stop. This brings me to where I am as of today. I am slowly trying to eat more mindfully but it is very difficult. For the past two days I have binged very heavily to the point where I am extremely bloated and feel like I am going to throw up. Ever since I have stopped starving myself I have put on weight which is really hard for me because I no longer have the figure I had when I was eating very few calories. People who are close to me congratulated me when I lost weight, and now that I am gaining it back I am worried that they will say mean things about me.Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with weight gain?",Mercury ,"Tue,05/12/2020-2:40pm",I think it's very good that,"I think it's very good that you realised eating so little made you feel unhealthy and so you decided to stop.

Um, about how I deal with it, uh i just stay away from the scale. I know this isn't the best way, since part of recovering is accepting myself as I am and not defining myself by my weight and also not being afraid of my weight, but it helps, for me at least, in the early stages of recovery. I check my weight once or twice a week, when I'm feeling good (so I won't try to restrict if I've gained a lot) to make sure I'm making progress.

566,beingbrave,05-11-20,Confronted ,"So, this is incredibly hard for me to pen, and I'm not quite sure what I'm looking for with it in terms of response, but I feel so alone right now and so scared.I am 17 years old, and I've had an ED since I was 6. I've been in treatment of some sort consistently since I was 12. I've never recovered. Not fully. I've had periods of relative peace with my ED, but I've never seen it fully leave me.I got out of another stint in residential treatment in October, and insurance kicked me out of PHP in November. After that, I was with an ED specialist and a dietician for a few months, until March when I transitioned to one therapist for my trauma because my ED was stable, and two is quite expensive. With COVID and everything going on, I've fallen back into my old behaviours and it's been really bad. For me and my parents. My mood has gone down, I've become aggressive and sometimes cruel, which is incredibly out of character for me, and of course, I've been physically sicker.My mom confronted me, hence the title, today and was brutally honest with me. She said that my dad has given up on me and that this is my last chance. I told her, and I meant it, that I was scared, and that I wanted to really try to recover fully this time, and that I hate lying to them about this. I really do. I keep lying to them about behaviours and motivation and effort and I hate it so much. I want nothing more than to just be hugged and told that it's okay and that they see me and why I'm doing this and that they love me anyway. However, why would they hug someone who lies to them? Who betrays them? They tell me that constant gaslighting and manipulation is a sure-fire way to get them to hate me, and I still do it and I don't know why.I'm scared I'll lose my family. I'm scared I'll lose my life. I'm scared that I'm not scared of this illness.I've been with my disorder, Bulimia, so long, and it's so hard to turn away from it.After we had that conversation, she sent me to make a list. A list of my long term goals and what I wanted to accomplish. I made it, along with a tearful video for my personal video diary collection, but then I ruined it all. She and my dad went out to go do something for twenty minutes, and I binged, and then of course, I purged. She smelled it when she came home, and she was so angry with me. Justifiably so. She said that she shouldn't have trusted me, she should have known I was lying about wanting recovery, and that she should have never believed I would try. I feel so hurt and lost right now. I've pushed away my entire support system again, and I feel like I'm hopeless. I feel like there's no chance of me getting better, or even repairing my familial bonds. I've said it before, but it's true. I'm scared I've ruined everything.This is the first time I've posted here, and I'm not sure if you guys can help, or even if anyone will read this. But it's worth a shot. I don't have any other options right now.",Kshaye26,"Tue,05/12/2020-12:11am",Hi,"Hi beingbrave. I remember my first time posting on the forums. I was 17, now 18, and I felt the same as you. I come from a very broken family and have no support system really. So I know what it’s like to feel alone. However, I’ve never really had anyone believe me about much in my life so I still haven’t told anyone about my ED struggle and no one cares enough to notice. I’m trying my best to figure thing out and work towards being better. I hope and pray that you will be able to work through this and rebuild your family relationship because I know how hard it is being alone through something like this. But I am here for you, as well as everyone else in this forum. Stay strong!

One:  You matter.Two:  Feelings can lie, so it is important what you do with your feelings.  Three:  Sometimes even when we feel some certain way, we need to go ahead and do the thing that is
        difficult.  The thing that our feelings are telling us that if we do this or that that we
        will not like the results.Four:  Feeling pass.  What we might be feeling in one hour or one day we may not be feeling the
       next.Five:  It is important not to live by our feelings and allow them to dictate how we live. Or the
       choices we make.Six:  It is very important to talk about your feelings and how they are affecting you.  In that
      sense, feelings matter a lot.  They tell us a lot about ourselves and what is going on.
      To ignore how we are feeling or push the feelings down, well, that doesn't work and they
      will eventually resurface and we will have to deal with them at that time.  Better to
      deal with them when you are feeling them.  Allow yourself to feel your feelings, but be
      careful to not allow them to dictate what you will do.I hope this helps.  Sometimes I feel that I want to self harm.  If I give in to that feeling it will not help me.  Or I feel like: fill in the blank.  I feel that no one cares about me.  If I allow these feelings or thoughts to grow and take over I will wind up depressed and isolate.  I need to challenge this thought or feeling.  Yes, some people don't care about me, even some of my sisters.  It hurts.  But I need to challenge these feelings or thoughts or else I stop the healing process.I know this is long, most of my posts are for some reason.  The gift of gab through my fingers.

569,iwanttolive,05-03-20,pAlgEgAb,"Hi.  I am glad you were helped by what I shared.  As I said, I have had to be inpatient too many times but I am in recovery now with a few slips with overeating that try to derail me but I get up and dust myself off and keep going.  My journey back to health was only possible because of my faith in Jesus and His love and care of me.  For me.  I would not be alive if it weren't for Him and for so long I didn't want to live.  I think that is in part why it was so difficult to let go of the eating disorder.  But as per my user name..iwanttolive, God has totally changed that for me.  I was afraid to face just another week let alone a year or a lifetime.  But everything is different in that regard.  I do want to live.  I want to share what Jesus did for me and His love for others and to offer Hope that recovery is possible.  I am finally really living instead of existing.So as far as you go...do you know if you will be going to inpatient and have you told your parents?  If not, maybe writing a letter about what you want to tell them and then either have them read it with you or just having written it it may give you a better idea of what you need to let them know.  Just know I do hope you do what you need to do to get stable.  If you have any questions, please ask and I will try to answer anything I can.  Best to you.iwanttolive",pAIgEgAb,"Mon,05/04/2020-11:08pm",thank you,"A couple of weeks ago my parents confronted me about my eating disorder. Since then I have met with doctors, nutritional therapists, and a CBT therapist to help me with my recovery. They told me we were doing the family based refeeding method where they take over all of my meals as I am an adolescent and still live with them.
While I know deep down inside that I am anorexic, I continue to struggle to admit to myself that I am sick. My doctors and nutritional therapist have concerns about my health because I am underweight but I still don't feel sick, or I guess sick enough to deserve treatment.
My parents taking over my meals has been very stressful for me for lots of reasons. It is done is a rather unstructured way. Each day the rules are different about what I have to eat and the times I eat. I have tried asking them to make it easier for me to understand but they both work all day and it is difficult for them. My relationship with my parents was...rocky to start with but now that they have to take strong roles in my recovery process it is making it even worse. My parents do not always communicate in a way that is effective for me and in turn I'm sure they can get frustrated with the way they communicate with me. It makes me very uncomfortable. They talk about the consequences of my actions, how disgusted they are with my body, and how disappointed they are in me. I tried to tell them that their reasoning isn't helpful at the moment but they didn't listen. At meal times when I really am trying hard they yell at me and it makes it even more difficult for me to finish. The guilt they make me feel makes this recovery process so much harder. The nutritional therapist has told them many times more effective ways to communicate, but they have not changed their ways. I know they are just scared and love me and are really trying hard, this is hard for all of us, but I can't help but feel like this really isn't working. I have lost a significant amount of weight since they have taken over because I work out in secret and throw away the food when they are not looking. My nutritional therapist set a weight limit that I am not allowed to dip below or she will recommend I go into an inpatient facility. I do not know what this limit is but I do know that I am pretty close to it. My parents do not want me to go into an inpatient facility, I think because they think I do not want to, but the truth is I really do. My parents have hurt me so much during this process I don't know if I will ever think of them the same way. I want to be able to full heartedly forgive them once I am in a better place, but I really do not know if I will be able to if this continues. I am not just saying that because I am upset that I am forced to recover, I just wish they helped me recover in a way that was best for me, not for them. I know that inpatient is not ideal but I won't be able to do the food things I do now. I also think it would be nice to meet people that are going through what I am because outside of this forum I feel really alone. I think the validation that I am sick and a more structured approach to my recovery would be beneficial. I might also feel less guilty and less of a disappointment refeeding away from my family. If I were to go away, I know they would still be a part of the recovery process, but it would be less of a role. I wouldn't be a burden on them anymore and I think my relationship with them would improve.
Sorry if this is really long and ranty but you have been so helpful during this process because I really don't know what to expect form the recovery process. I meet with my nutritional therapist tomorrow and hopefully some of this comes up, but until then I don't know what to do. I fear if I do not get the recommendation to go inpatient soon, I will continue having to do it with my parents.
Thank you so so much you have been so helpful and your story is so inspiring",pAIgEgAb,"Mon,05/04/2020-11:16pm",just in case,if it wasn't clear above I really want to stress that I am so thankful to have a family that tries their best to help and support me at this point but maybe they could just do it in a different way,alwaysthinking,"Tue,05/05/2020-5:44am",Makes sense,"You don't have to apologize for being long and ""ranty.""  What you said totally makes sense. It's a shame that parents think that they know what they're doing when they totally are hurting us the most. Even though I am an adult, I lived with my parents until I was 41. And their way of dealing with my mental illness has really hurt me more than anything else. So I really get it. And I am so sorry for what you're having to experience. So I hope that you get the recommendation to go to inpatient because I agree that would probably be the most helpful. I have been inpatient for my eating disorder four different times, and you're right, be validation and also the structure, and also simply getting new skills really does help. And it sounds like that is what you are needing right now. I hope that you get the help that you truly need.

I agree with alwaysthinking. The family based model is supposed to be supportive and not harsh. It is difficult when done appropriately but when not it is very challenging. I know it wouldn't have worked for me and it wasn't around when I was a teenager. That is why another option is available, hospitalization. Both have their challenges.  How did it go today with your nutrionist?  How are you today?  Know you are not alone. iwanttolive",pAIgEgAb,"Wed,05/06/2020-11:40am",thank you,"Yesterday was especially difficult and I expect things to be for a long time. I was very nervous to bring up different treatment options with my therapist but luckily I did not have to. She suggested to me that I receive a higher level of treatment. Tomorrow morning I will have an online evaluation with her recommended center to determine what level of care would best meet my needs. It will likely be a partial hospitalization program as they do not have any other options in my city. I am nervous, there are a lot of unknowns, but I am trying my best to take things one day at a time. I am excited that my parents will have a different role in the recovery process though.
My parents were so horrible last night. They just yelled and yelled at me and made me feel awful. They told me how mad they were at me and how disappointed I should be in myself. I never meant to hurt anyone. My father told me he thought I was doing this to get back at them for moving and for attention but that is so horrible, I would never do that, I can't believe he would think such horrible things about me. They said they may never forgive me or trust me again. I wish they knew that I already feel bad enough. I already hate myself for this and blame myself for everything that has happened. I hate myself for not wanting to get better and the things I do. I just wish I knew another way. I do not know if I will ever be able to look at my parents the same way again. I know this can sound overdramatic from someone in my position, that I will one day look back and think it was silly for me to say such things, but they were so cruel. I just wish I could make them understand how much they hurt me every time they speak. Maybe I am just being fragile or sensitive but it really hurt me. I know I hurt them with my actions so I guess I deserve it.",iwanttolive,"Wed,05/06/2020-6:21pm",NO,"Hi.  I understand that your parent's are upset but you do not deserve to be treated that way. Period.  Do not take that on.  It belongs to them and them alone.  They sound like they  could do with getting some therapy of their own to help them deal with their feelings and how to best help you and themselves during this time.  No one asks to be sick and if we do there is a reason.  You are coping in the only way you know how to and by being in therapy they will teach you how to get in touch with your feelings and how you respond to pain and mistreatment and so much more.  We have lacked these skills and will learn them in therapy.  Among other things.  Right now I hear pain.  Maybe fear?  From the way you are being treated?  Please if they blame you for this illness, don't take it on.  Easier said than done.NEDA has a parent tool kit on their web site.  Maybe they might want to take a look at it.  It explains about the disorder and gives tips on how to help, how to communicate, things not to say, suggestions of what not to do.  It may help them understand if they are willing to look at it.  You may want to pull up the information and then ask if they would look at it.  It is quite extensive it may take them a while to look through.. Just an idea.  I wish you the best.iwanttolive",pAIgEgAb,"Wed,05/06/2020-8:35pm",Thank you for saying that.,"Thank you for saying that. Though it is hard for me to believe it right now I will try my best. I worry about correcting my parents because they often take it personally and get defensive. I wish I knew how to help them through this because it is really hard on them as well. Tomorrow morning is my assessment and I am pretty nervous. I worry about not being sick enough to receive treatment. I know it was recommended that I go here but I still feel like people have worse situations than I do. If this happens I do not want to have to continue to do the family based method because it is really hard for me.
I want to thank you so much so responding to me. This has been really challenging for me. I do not know anyone who has gone through this and it is really helpful to talk to someone who understands.",iwanttolive,"Wed,05/06/2020-9:01pm",pAlgEgAb,"Hi.  Can I tell you something?  Almost every person struggling with an eating disorder doesn't ""feel sick enough"" to get help.  I think there may be a few reasons why.  Denial.  Fear of getting help and what that means for the eating disorder and its role in our lives.  There is a fear in letting go because it serves a purpose.  We may not know what that purpose is until we enter therapy and then we get help to learn other ways to deal with those things.  Identity.  So many times a person with an eating disorder feel safe in its ""identity"".  But it really isn't a good friend. It is an enemy.  I have learned to find my identity in who Jesus says I am.  I am not always able to walk in that but I try.  And I know that no matter how underweight I got, I wasn't happy.  Only closer to death.  But God wants me alive and now I want to be alive too.  NEVER thought I would say that or want that but I do.  Despite the pain.  Despite the trouble.  Despite my fears.  I have HOPE.  TO me, Hope is a Person.  He gives me Hope.  The desire to push through and stand up when I fall.  You may be too young to remember weeble wobbles.  They are egg shaped little toys that have rounded bottoms. The saying is ""weeble's wobble but they don't fall down"".  That is because if you push then down they pop right back up.  That is my goal.  Like Bozo the Clown. You can bunch the snot out of him but he will always stand back up unless all the air has gone out of him!!!So I am glad you are going.  If your team is saying they are recommending this you will most likely get in.  I know you are scared.  But just think of how freeing it will be when you don't have so much fear around eating.  It took me way too long to get to where I am now but I can eat what I want and even eat what others have cooked without having to know every ingredient.  There are still days I overeat or binge but it comes in waves.  I do well for long periods of time and then struggle for a while and then get back on track.  I don't particularly life the size of my body but I am thankful I am healthy and can go on walks and work part time and play with my dog instead of barely being able to do those things.
So, be brave.  I pray that God gives you His peace and that you do well tomorrow.  That you connect with others who are in the same situation as you.  That you trust your team and are able to open up and learn.  I pray that your parents lighten up and not be so harsh with you and that they get help.  For now...let me know how it goes tomorrow.",pAIgEgAb,"Thu,05/07/2020-2:32pm",things happen for a reason,"The assessment was a little difficult for me. I tried my best to be as honest as possible because even through this is scary I wanted to do this for myself. They decided that because of my weight and health status I cannot do partial hospitalization. Within the next 36 hours I have to go to their residential treatment center. There isn't one in my city so we have to go to the closest one five hours away. I am pretty scared. Though I do not believe it full heartedly yet, I do believe this is the wake up call I needed to begin to see that I am sick. Even if I am not there yet, I do believe I will get there.
I will miss my family. They have really tried their best during this process. This has been really stressful on me and them so maybe some separation would be best. Time away could be just what we need to repair our relationship.
I have no idea what to expect from a residential treatment center. I am just going to keep telling myself that I am strong and I am worthy. One day I will believe it and feel it and be the best I can be.",iwanttolive,"Thu,05/07/2020-2:53pm",pAlgEgAb,"Hi.  I am hoping the same for you, that this time away will be healing for you and your parent's.  If you can, review the information I sent you and see about calling the place you are going to go to.  They will be able to answer any questions you have before you go so you have more peace about going.  I know what you are going through.  It is scary, but so is living with an eating disorder. One thing that was helpful to me and still is is to try to separate from the eating disorder.  In this way;  instead of saying ""My eating disorder, or I am anorexic or fill in the blank... and say instead I struggle with an eating disorder or ""the"" eating disorder"".  I know it sounds strange but it really helps to make it so that the eating disorder isn't your identity.  It takes it and makes it outside of yourself instead of owning you.  The eating disorder or any other label we may get isn't us. It doesn't own us.  It may ""feel"" that is does.  I know.  I have several diagnosis.  They aren't who I am though.  They are something that describe symptoms that I have and that I struggle with.Enough of that.  I mentioned my faith.  May I ask if you have any faith back round or if you believe in Jesus?  You do not have to answer if it makes you uncomfortable, it is just that my faith in Jesus has sustained me through so much and He has helped me survive.  Not only survive but be an overcomer.  In the next several days, you may feel very anxious.  Just know that deep down inside you know this is what you need.  It will not be easy, I will not lie. But it will be doable.  You will be surrounded with others who understand and are going through what you are.  Five hours isn't that far.  Yes, it is a distance, but close enough that you don't have to fly.  I will pray for you and hope that this is something that again, is healing for you and your parent's.  Keep us, me, posted.  I will be looking.  Sending you a virtual hug.",pAIgEgAb,"Thu,05/07/2020-8:02pm",sent with a virtual hug:),"Thank you for the advice. Separating myself from the eating disorder made me feel a little less...powerless? That isn't the exact word I would use but it made me feel the most like me I have in a long time. Having an eating disorder has made me feel kind of alienated or less than recently but using this has made me realize that I am still me, just with a little more struggles. It really put a smile on my face.
While I am not religious I do believe in God. I never learned the formal teachings of Christianity, Catholicism, or any other of that sort so my beliefs mostly stem from what I feel in my heart. I feel that God is watching over me and has a plan for me and that angels will guide me. Feeling this reminds me that everything happens for a reason. I will grow from these struggles and everything will be okay. Reading what you have written reminded me of these beliefs for the first time in a long time and it feels as if the dark place I found myself in is growing a little brighter. Yes, I struggle with an eating disorder, it is there, but I can still find happiness in my life. I have much to be thankful for and carry too much love in my heart to let the eating disorder take control over me.
You have really helped me reach a turning point in my recovery. I do not know how long this motivation will last, it comes in spouts, but I feel more motivated, and strong. Your story has inspired me and you have been so helpful in this scary point in my life saying thank you isn't enough to describe how I feel. I feel truly grateful to have this platform where individuals like you can impact lives in such meaningful ways.

570,heythere,05-05-20,Coping with weight gain,"Hey!So since this year started i've been trying to get rid of all my purging behaviors (with various levels of results.....) But that has made me gain a lot of weight ( and I wasn't underweight to begin with, nor am I overweight now, just on the other end of the healthy spectrum, I hope I am not violating any rules by saying this and I of course won't say any numbers)
Some days I feel great, but most days the self- hate is overwhelming. I'm a dancer, and (being on quarantine doesn't help) I've been slowly loosing motivation to take class and train my body, as I feel like I have nothing worthy to fight for, if that makes sense.
Also, if I was in a healthier miendset, at least I would have known it was for something. But I am on the same binge and restrict and sometimes purge cycle, just a lot heavier.
It has also made people not treat me as ""seriously"". My doctor doesn't care at all about it since I am not at a barely healthy weight anymore. I didn't ""look like I have an Ed"" ( whatever that means) before, but now even less.
I just feel alone, and sometimes wonder.if it's all worth it. Sometimes I just want to quit wanting to recover, to quit dance, to just quit my whole life and hide under my bed so no one has to see me like this.
I was wondering if anyone has any coping mechanism for when feeling down by weight gain??
Thanks to all!!
I really hope I didn't exceed any rules by saying this, I know it's a sensitive topic for a lot of us.",JustTryingIGuess,"Fri,05/08/2020-9:15am",Coping With Weight Gain,"I totally understand the fear of gaining weight. For me, I started off overweight (btw, saying ""overweight"", ""healthy weight"", and ""underweight"" are allowed as long as you do not endorse poor eating behavior) and began to slim down. My parents and friends would consistently compliment me, so my self-worth came to be tied closely to my weight. Once I stopped losing weight, I totally panicked and fell into a depression. My therapist started agreeing to less meetings (once every other week) because she felt I was ""fine now"".
So how do we deal with this?
My answer is that you need to find things that make you happy once again. And try practicing body neutrality. First of all, when we narrow ourselves down to one or two specific parts of our lives- in your case dance and school- it can feel like the whole world is caving in if those things go lopsided. And things happen outside of our control. The only thing we can do is control our own responses and remember it's better to be alive and healthy than it is to be sick and thin. Pick up other things that make you happy. Paint, go outside, call some friends, learn to sew, contact family. It's the small things that can make the day feel that much better. Moreover, try not thinking of your body negatively or positively- but rather like almost a machine. You need to eat to keep your body running. To keep your heart beating, your lungs breathing, and your limbs moving. This doesn't always work but I find it works for me when I feel like restricting.

also, i just got off the phone with my boyfriend. apparently i've become really distant, even though i don't mean to. he also said that every time i try to make myself better it always ends in self destructive behavior, as if i don't want help. there are times where my mind tells me i don't need help, that i'm perfectly fine. but as i reflect on it it's obviously not true. i just can't get professional help, due to my parents not understanding what i'm going through.

thank you so much. anything you can add will be helpful. i feel very guilty and alone",Tryingtoheal,"Sat,05/02/2020-10:37pm",some things to expect ,you'll eat at a table with others.  You'll be weighed but won't know your weight.  You'll have group therapies during the day.   Someone will accompany you to the bathroom and stand outside.  Your room and bathroom are locked during the day.   They wake you up early.   There's limited internet access and phone time.,iwanttolive,"Sat,05/02/2020-11:01pm",pAlgEgAb,"Hello and welcome to the forum.  I hope that you get the help you need.  There is no shame in needing help and support.  If you tried outpatient, then use this opportunity to have the support you need.  Depending on where you go, you may have limited individual sessions with a therapist.  They do most of the work in groups.  You will meet with a dietician who will assess your nutritional needs and create a meal plan for you. You may or may not be albe to meal plan.  Some places just ""plate"" you, they choose for you.  Other places have you learn to create a meal plan and you will have a few groups to do this each week for the days ahead.  You will probably be able to  have three dislikes allowed, otherwise you will have to eat what is on your plate.  If you are unable to complete after you will most likely be given a supplement in the equivalent of the calories in the food you are unable to finish.  If this continues and depending on your medical situation, they may need to give you a feeding tube.  That is only if you continue to lose weight and is not meant to be a punishment but to help you do what you are not able to do. Try not to let this scare you.  It is meant to help reduce the amount you have to eat until you are able. The meal plan usually is increased every several days until you reach your target weight.  The meal times can be stressful so they have staff available if you are needing support and everyone else is in the same situation whether there for bulimia or anorexia.  Or binge eating.  All will need to support each other.  Most places allow forty-five minutes to complete meals.  For those who eat quickly, this can be a very long forty-five minutes as most of the time everyone has to stay at the table until the end of the meal.  Usually people find it difficult to have conversation so games are played, such as I am thinking of something that starts with the letter A and then the next person says that and adds a b word and the following person adds a C and includes A and B as well.  This helps to take the focus off  of the meal and eases the stress.
A few good questions to ask the facility and I encourage you to ask, are will you be plated or will you be able to choose your meals.  How much time will you have for each meal.  Will you be allowed in your room during the day.  Some places allow it others don't.  How much phone time will you have.  The groups will usually always include art therapy.  You may want to ask what groups they will have and if you will see a therapist.  You will probably see your psychiatrist daily.  Some other groups may include meal processing, to see how everyone is doing with their meals.  Others may include coping skills to educate you in different ways of dealing with anxiety or depression or trauma...things underlying the eating disorder.  They will probably call them tools for your tool kit for when you go home.  Other groups may be family dynamics to help with dealing with your family issues.  You may have a few family therapy sessions, you may want to ask. If you live far they will do phone sessions.  Your team will decide if this is appropriate for you.  Usually you get waken up early for vitals; blood pressure and weight check and in some places you can go back to sleep if there is time and then you get dressed and head off for breakfast.  There is usually free time and depending on the place you may get to sit outside.  If the weather is nice, they may even do a group outside",iwanttolive,"Sat,05/02/2020-11:14pm",part 2,"Hi.  I didn't want to lose all I just typed so I saved it and I have some more.  You need to bring shoes without laces, if you don't have any, slippers or they have ties for shoes but they remove the laces. Don't bring anything that has strings.  They won't let you wear them.  You can bring books that you like, a journal without wire, no magazines though.  You may or may not be able to bring your pillow or blanket, I would ask.  Remember, everyone is there to get help.  The staff is generally very helpful and understands how difficult this is for everyone.  Most of the patients support each other and cares.  Friendships may develop but that is not the main goal.  You may also want to ask the time frame that they expect you will be there although it is different for everyone.  When I was in treatment, the time in was much longer that it is today.  You are not alone and God is with you.  If you believe in Jesus, He is only a prayer away.   Sometimes they limit calls so you can focus on treatment.  That is different for different places.  I tried to cover the bases.  As you can tell, I am a veteran.  Not proud of that but am glad to be able to offer you and idea of what to expect.  One more thought about groups.  If you call to ask questions, and I encourage you to do that, I would ask what treatment modality they use.  Meaning DBT or CBT.  That would be dialectical behavioral therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy.  One teaches a lot of skills to get through the illness the other uses changing your thought process.  Most will use a combination of both.  I wish you the best in your journey.  And it is a journey, not a sprint.  As far as not wanting to recover but wanting to be recovered if I read that correctly, the journey can be long and difficult.  But trials and challenges, whatever they may be, can make us stronger people, more understanding, it builds character and can in the end make us better equipped to handle life's future struggles.  One thing is for sure, we will always need to work on something.  To lean something.  To grow and to mature and to learn.  The process is part of what makes a pear out of a grain of sand.

579,alwaysthinking,05-03-20,Instant antianxiety med,"Yesterday was exceedingly stressful for me. I had to deal with a phone company that had told me last month that I was getting my discount, due to being on disability, in May.  But when I looked up my bill, this was not true. So I had to call them again and I was on the phone with them for an hour. And after being transferred from one person back to another person, Back and forth, I found out that last month, They never did do what they had promised. I was so frustrated that with the last person to whom I spoke I ended up crying my eyes out. So hopefully it got settled. We'll see. But anyway all through the day yesterday, I was a mess and I was basically completely numbed out.  And it finally got so bad, that I Felt so overwhelmed, that I could tell that I was getting extremely suicidal. But I did not want to give into it at all. But I also was very overwhelmed with everything that has been going on and that phone bill issue was just the Last Straw. And so I finally just prayed and prayed and completely threw everything on Jehovah God. I was bawling my eyes out. I figured I would have to take my anti-anxiety Med afterwards. I was telling Him that this was too much, that I just could not handle anything anymore. I was begging Him for whatever he thought was best because I just could not do it. And very shortly afterward, I felt this immense calm and peace wash over me. And I was able to get through the evening without any problems.  Jehovah God really is an instant anti-anxiety medicine.

580,silverstars,05-02-20,Zero Appetite Again,"i was trying.i really was.
Then,i had to say goodbye to my beloved kitty Sam on Monday,and my heart was broken.
He was very ill though,and in pain,so it was time.He had been in my life for the past 13 1/2 years.
i adopted him not long after i left an abusive man.
Sam's love saved me.
Since,i have felt so lost.So desperately sad,even though it brings me comfort to know that he is now free of his suffering,has been restored to the joy of his youth,is lazing in the sunshine,and i will see him again.But i have been so down and anxious that i have completely lost my appetite.i had a massive panic attack yesterday that lasted for hours.The last thing on my mind was dinner.i know that eating regularly would help with my mood and anxiety,i just can't seem to force myself to.
i have lost the bit of weight i gained when i was eating better for about a week or so.
Nothing is appetizing.i did binge once at night,ate something quickly without wanting it,without tasting it.i feel so trapped.
The dietician i had been in contact with never responded to my last email so i don't know what is up with that.My ED voice is quietly pleased with how things are going.i had such a great phone session with my pyschiatrist/therapist a couple of weeks ago.After talking to him i felt really inspired and confident about recovery.That has dissipated.But i am so torn,and being pulled in two directions,that of recovery and that of the ED.i don't even know where i am going with this so i am going to stop now.Just having a pretty terrible time.",alwaysthinking,"Sat,05/02/2020-12:40pm",Sorry,"I'm sorry about Sam dying.

In terms of losing your appetite, I encourage you to try to not put too much stress onto yourself.  Grief is real, even with pets.  I know you need to eat and the longer you don't the voice of the eating disorder will get.  I think it is ""normal"" to lose an appetite or overeat when faced with such pain.  A lot of people right now are using food in ways they may never have because of the virus, even those who never had an eating disorder.  So I encourage you to be gentle with yourself and know that this is a little normal to experience.
Just try to not let it turn into a relapse.  You have worked with a lot of courage to get where you are and the eating disorder will try to take advantage of any circumstance.  I encourage you to say NO to that voice and YES to the voice that says, this is the way to go, come this way.

583,alwaysthinking,04/30/2020,Hurting,"(Yes, this will be long.) I am definitely hurting emotionally today. And I have taken it out on myself both by verbal abuse (internally) and by simply shutting down and not allowing myself to access my feelings.  It started with a poor night's sleep, due to my worrying about my surgeon consult this morning.  I had been reading about the bacteria that was in the culture that had been found in the cyst on my back. And also going with what the doctor from the Urgent Care had said about it. And it was putting me in a pretty freaked out mode. Because it sounded like I had bacteria traveling through my bloodstream in a very rare blood disease. I was trying not to diagnose myself, obviously. Because I know way too many people do that when they read into things on the web, even just from reputable sites.  But I was also going from the direct culture results and what the urgent care doc had said.  And then when I got to the general surgeon, I asked him the questions about it and he seemed totally unconcerned. He said that this bacteria can also be found on the skin and it's very unlikely that it traveled through the bloodstream at all. He said that it's very common to be found on the skin, in fact.  He also completely said the opposite of what the urgent care doctor said. They had said to get the cyst removed as soon as possible through surgery and this surgeon wait for it to form again in about three months and then remove it. So that alone had me a a tizzy not knowing whom to believe, but I figured the surgeon would have more specific knowledge, than a ""regular"" doc.  But I still thought it might be wise to get a second opinion just in case. Regardless, when I left the surgeon's office, I was just in this general daze, with no real thoughts forming in my mind. For some reason though, I felt like I deserved a treat after that. I did actually need a little bit more for the snack that I had had earlier. My morning snack really wasn't up to complete ""par,"" per my meal plan, so I decided it was okay to get an extra little treat.  I didn't really understand why I felt I needed it though. I just knew I did. And then even when I got home, I still just felt completely out of it. I really did not have any thoughts formulating in my head. And this is totally unlike me. (i.e. my username)  And then during lunch I had dessert for part of my meal plan, and I kept eating it.   ALL of it.  Even though I was completely stuffed. Even though I really didn't want it. Even though I knew it wasn't good for me to have that much. But I was just so numb. And hurting so much and I didn't even know why. And then I was basically chastising myself and berating myself for doing so. (Overeating)  And I told myself. Well, that's it. You are not allowed to eat anything else today.  And I have been miserable all day. And even though I did finally just eat supper, I am still totally stuffed and wish I hadn't. But at least I finally understand. I understand why I felt so terrible once I was done with my appointment. I understand why I felt the need for the little treat extra for the snack. I understand why I kept eating even though I was so numb and so stuffed. Or at least I sort of understand that. It doesn't always make sense why we sometimes turn to food as a comfort, especially when it makes us feel worse, afterwards.  But at any rate, when I had my phone appointment with my trauma therapist a little bit later, I had no sooner told him that I really didn't know how I was doing and that I had the appointment with the surgeon and I still really didn't know how I was doing or why, and then I was gone - into the past.  Yeah, I had a dissociative flashback. I hope that this is okay to say on here. I know we are not supposed to get into details about trauma because it could be triggering to others. And I do not intend to get into that. All I'm saying is that in that flashback, I realized that the surgeon I saw today was also a past abuser.  And I have been absolutely miserable ever since realizing that. My therapist asked me how I was feeling once I came out of the flashback. I told him I felt miserable, vulnerable, and invisible. He questioned the last word. And I said well, A little bit of feeling invisible and also wishing I were invisible. And we had a really rough session. Not because of him or anything; just because I'm so overwhelmed as usual and I feel like I am so stuck always in the past and that it's constantly ruining my life. All I want to be doing is the ministry and teaching people about Jehovah and the future when no one has to worry about these things like this ever again, nor will anyone have e.d.'s or any illnesses, period.  And yet I can't even do that to the degree I want because I keep getting stuck trying to just survive. I'm struggling more and more everyday to be able to eat properly. Obviously today didn't rate that way. I'm wanting to do these PHP plans that I wrote out and I can't even stay motivated enough to do that. I get so frustrated with myself because I know that I have entirely too high expectations and at the same time it's like if I don't exceed them or at least accomplish them to the extent that I am desiring to do, then how am I ever going to get better and be able to do what I want and help people the way I need and want? I'm just so tired of all of this. I'm so tired of my life being so blasted miserable. There never seems to be an end to it. I know it's Satan obviously turning on the heat, like Jesus said he was going to do.  And I'm trying so hard to lean on Jehovah. And I'm trying so hard to endure because of how much I love Him. And nothing I do ever feels like it's going to be ""Enough.""  I know this isn't a logical or rational thought - it's totally based on messages that have been plied into my head for over forty years.  And knowing that doesn't make me feel any less like it's ok.  I still FEEL the same way.  I feel like I am never going to get off this insane merry-go-round of being miserable, then falling so hard that I need a hospital, then doing well in there, because my mother hen side takes over, and that makes me feel better.  But it doesn't solve the real problem.  I just get out and start all over again.  And I'm still hurting.",tryingtobebrave,"Thu,04/30/2020-10:17pm",Hugs,"I’m really out of it right now, but I just wanted to say that I relate so much to you’re entire post.

Feelings lie most of the time.  It is important to know this.  That we don't live based off of our feelings because more often than not we will only be brought to a not so good place.  We need to live based on what God says about us.  He says He loves you.   That HE did ALL the work on the cross.  That the work we do for Him is out of our love for Him, not to earn His love as His love for us is perfect and not based on what we do but what HE did.  The wonderful thing about our Heavenly Father is that He will never let go of us, even when we lose our way.  We are inscribed in the palm of His hands.  We are sealed in Him.  Nothing we do can make Him love us less than He already does, and there is nothing we can do to make Him love us more, for His love is perfect.
I understand your desire to get out and serve Him.  I have the same desire.  There are times when I am unable to but in the past two years, God has given me the ability to go out and share Jesus love with many.  I take no credit for what I do, as I know it comes from Him.  I would have never been able to do this before as I was so sick and so shy.

588,pauline96,04/30/2020,Stuck with guilt and calorie counting,"Hello. I’m new here but I’m struggling with it for so long that I just felt like sharing and hopefully hearing some advice from anybody who already overcame this kind of struggles.
I was never sure if I can even call myself anorexic. I never starved myself to the extent of fasting or anything like that... but I had a set calorie limit. Literally the lowest possible for me if I were lying down and doing nothing. I eventually went below that. And it stayed like that for 3 years. Eventually losing weight but still not feeling thin enough. For now I’m still underweight, everybody around me wishing I'd gain some weight...
But I always just felt bad when I ate anything over that magic calorie limit. Even if I’d walk a bunch that day, it was always the same set amount.
At times when I didn’t exercise, I looked horrible. I had no energy, my symptoms worsened but I still didn’t feel like eating more. I spent one year in Japan with all those restrictions and I lost so many opportunities to try amazing food there just because I was scared. I was scared to eat anything more even though I was walking on daily basis. And I couldn’t stop counting calories.
My body was starving though. Extreme hunger would kick in from time to time and I couldn’t control it at all. It kept on happening once in a few weeks, reminding me that I’m not eating enough.
In hopes of starting to eat more, I started to exercise and take vitamins. But I didn’t really start eating more. I’d exercise every single day. I’d never skip those and I eventually started feeling guilty if I didn’t exercise enough.
There were even weeks when I’d increase calories a little. I promised doctors to eat more... but then I just stop out of fear that I will gain weight. I wish I could stop counting but first of all... I wish I knew how much I can eat. Right now I’m obviously forced to stay at home more but before I’d walk a lot, I'd exercise… and yet, I still don’t feel allowed to eat more than that magic calorie limit that kept on being the rule every single day for 3 years. I don’t know how to overcome that, I really don’t trust myself that I can eat more. And if I can… how do I know how much more food can I have? Extreme hunger made me completely confused and every single time after it disappears, I'm back to feeling like ""the less I eat, the better."" I'm so stuck...",alwaysthinking,"Thu,04/30/2020-6:21pm",Dietitian/Nutritionist,"I am so there with you as far as wishing I knew what my body would be able to handle, calorie-wise vs. how much I exercise.  I know that when I am in the inpatient setting, I have been on three different meal plans at three different hospitals. But when I get out I'm allowed to exercise because I'm on my own and I never know which meal plan to follow because I do not have a dietitian or nutritionist. And I go back to the same mind frame that you are having right now. So if it is at all possible for you, I urge you to seek out a dietician or nutritionist because they would be the best ones to answer that question.

590,Dressagequeen,04/28/2020,I’m pretty sure they use Atypical anorexia as a form of torture in hell.,"My eating disorder started when I was 15 after a sexual trauma as a means to control something that was happening to me. I struggled with anorexia in its typical form until 5 years ago. I’m a professional horse trainer, and I like working with special needs horses. One of my more explosive horses had a moment, and bronced for 2 minutes straight before I could get him to stop. Unfortunately the act of staying on pulled every muscle in my body and I couldn’t leave my bed or move for three days (i legit had to use a wheely chair to go to the bathroom) and then I had to be in intensive PT for six months. So after over a decade of forcing my body to acclimate to the metabolism of a sea turtle in an athletes body when I wasn’t moving as much as usual, I put on weight fast. Once I was able to start working out again I panicked hard and cut down calories while working out excessively and kept gaining more weight. I Only recently started seeing a new nutritionist who specializes with ED who told me I had atypical anorexia which I had never knew was a thing. And it is a cruel twisted joke. The less I eat the more I gain weight. I was stressed out one day last fall and did not eat much and I gained weight that day. So now I am trying to force myself to eat- we set a goal, but after so many years of starving myself I have no appetite.  It’s like in the Pirates of the Caribbean movie where the food  turns to ash in his mouth. Does anyone out there have any tricks of how to get yourself to eat? Its so frustrating I just feel super lost.... sorry to be a bummer :(",alwaysthinking,"Wed,04/29/2020-9:49pm",I hear you,"""Atypical"" anorexia - I know. Another label. I was just inpatient for mine. The eating disorder therapist there said she absolutely hates that label. Even though it is under the DSM as one of the criteria for eating disorders, she says anorexia is anorexia.  It's behaviors. It has nothing to do with weight. And she hates the stigma that comes along with that title and label. I totally get from where you're coming. Because I have super slow metabolism, even though I've danced and exercised like crazy ever since I was three. But once I developed anorexia, my lovely crazy metabolism said, ""I don't care.  You may lose weight, but not the way you want to."" So I got labeled with atypical anorexia. But as far as getting yourself to eat when you have zero appetite, that's another story in itself. I'm still struggling with it on a daily basis. I know that in order to boost my metabolism, I have to do so. I also know that this is going to help me in my recovery as well. I know that for me, I have to keep reminding myself what is most important to me.  For me, that is serving Jehovah God and teaching people about Him and the hope for the future. I know I cannot teach people about the Bible and do my Ministry if I am starving myself to death. It's still a struggle everyday.  And I know it's worth the fight. So I hope that you can find something that means more to you than giving into the eating disorder. Hang in there and just say you have anorexia and forget the other stupid label. We're All in This Together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

False. I stopped all of the purging and fasting and binging almost 10 years ago and only just recently am I realizing that I'm not recovered at all. My thoughts became distorted from the very beginning (if they weren't already) and now I'm realizing what problems they have caused. My ideas and thoughts regarding confidence and body image and food and health & well being and literally everything about myself are so far from where they should be. I need professional help for that, that's for sure. I don't dare tell anyone this and in fact, the only person that knows about anything of this is my ex. It's nice to know that I'm not alone and people really do understand and get it. I like that I have a place to talk about it and get help and not feel anymore shame and embarrassment and guilt than I already do. I've been through some real garbage, ""how did I make it out alive"" situations in my short time on earth and the only thing that has been my constant is my faith. I've never had suicidal thoughts or ideations because I just have this belief that God has a greater plan. I know that I need help and I want to get help and start recovering from this but what do I do and where do I begin and how many people do I really need to tell about this? It's entering the unknown and not knowing what to expect or what's next.

593,alwaysthinking,04/27/2020,Already??,"I really did not want to go ""downhill"" this soon, after inpatient, and when you think about it, this is exactly why it's suggested that you do a proper step-down, afterwards.  Except in my case, it's not an option.  I go from inpatient to one hour a week, once a week, with my absolutely wonderful e.d. therapist.  But it's like telling someone that they have to start at the bottom of Mount Everest and jump to the very top in one giant leap. It's not enough. And my therapist knows this and that's why she keeps trying to find me someone who can see me more often. But it's just not available. No one takes my insurance. And no PHP program does either And no residential does either. And so I just keep plummeting to the same blasted mind frame, and I keep feeling like my world is going to go completely to pieces around me. Granted, I have not given into any behaviors since I got out. But I sure did get close today. And when I looked at the Warnings on the label of a new Med that I have to start, it said that diarrhea is a possibility, for up to three months after stopping it.  I only take it for 10 days. But I remember the last time I was on it, and it definitely causes diarrhea for a long time. And that good old eating disorder voice is thrilled to pieces with it. Because I have felt so uncomfortable in my body today. Anytime I ate, I felt like I was bloated and I just wanted to exercise to the extremes to get rid of it. And I just feel like I am back where I started. I'm so frustrated. And I'm so tired of this. And yet it's not really surprising, because I really did not go to an inpatient for eating disorders. I went to a psych Hospital that simply monitored my eating.  That's not what I signed up for and that's not what I thought I was going into. They did not help me in the slightest. But I intend to keep fighting. I have my own PHP set up to do on my own tomorrow. If nothing's available for me, then I do it myself. With Jehovah's help as always.

I just know there is sooo much deep intrinsic junk that's been stuck in my head for 40 years and it's going to take a long time to get rid of it. But I keep trying. Because I know that  Life is worth it because serving Jehovah is the most important thing to me. It doesn't matter whether or not I feel like I am worth it, but I know that my love for Jehovah God is more important than anything in the world. My love for Him has always been the most important thing to me.  That has always been the thing that keeps me going. Because that is Satan's challenge to all of us. Will we serve God when things get the hardest? That is his whole purpose in challenging us. That is why we go through all of these trials. Satan is throwing all of these fiery bullets at us to Make our lives miserable just to see if we are going to serve God Faithfully. He is trying to make us decide if we love God more than if we love ourselves.  And my love for Jehovah always goes first. It always has. So I keep trying.

I learned that body image is the last thing that gets worked on. It's been intrinsic in us for ages. And it's based on so many different factors. We can tell ourselves all the logical things until we're blue in the face and when it comes right down to it, we still get stuck with everything that the people in our lives molded us to believe. That doesn't mean it can't change. It just means it's the hardest thing to change.  So, in answer to your question, I have never liked how I look. I've been inpatient four times for my eating disorder, even though it just started a few years ago.  (I'm 44.)  But I've hated how I looked ever since I was 8 years old. So that is something that is deep-seated in probably all of us. So you're not alone. And I still have faith that we can all get past it eventually.

And I did it without any anxiety. My biggest issue today was trying to get a bandaid on my back where my cyst was.  Before I got discharged, I told the nurse that the directions from the urgent care doctor had been to remove the dressing in 48 hours and replace with a waterproof bandage.  But she couldn't find the right paperwork and instead, she found the old paperwork and put on a totally different dressing. So after I had bathed today, and that dressing came off (quite uncomfortable, I might add), I had the worst ordeal of my life of trying to figure out how to put a waterproof Band-Aid on my left shoulder blade. That is where the cyst was. Has anyone ever tried to put a bandaid on their own left shoulder blade? It is nearly impossible. I spent 35 minutes after exercising today doing this, and I think I exerted more energy trying to put on that band-aid and removing the paper around it than I did in the 30 minutes of doing the treadmill, just prior to this.  But with Jehovah God's help I persevered and endured (and also with a lot of creativity - I was using a back scratcher and a hand mirror to see my own back in the other mirror.)  But anyway, other than that, my day has been absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much for asking.

601,alwaysthinking,04/25/2020,I'm back,"Hi, everyone. I'm back from the inpatient facility that really did not treat eating disorders. It was a combination psych facility that just had one group a day that dealt with an eating disorder. It was very disappointing because the other groups were things that I've done 10 million times in any other psych facilities I've ever been in. The only positive thing was that I got treatment for an infected cyst on my back.  But I am doing better, because Jehovah God helped me as usual. At one point in time, I had a dissociative flashback, and a nurse who did not know about my allergies to chemical fragrances, tried to get me out of it by using essential oils. The oil that she decided to use was lavender. This is the worst one that she possibly could have chosen because this causes anaphylaxis with me. And when I finally did come out of my flashback, I coughed and then started wheezing and could not stop. They finally had to use an EpiPen on me. And when I got back to my senses, so to speak. I also came to my senses. Yes, I realized why in the world am I allowing people from my past who are not even in my life anymore, to continue controlling me? Why am I allowing people who are not in my life to continue to tell me how much I can and cannot eat?  So, Jehovah helped get the strength to say that I refuse to let anyone make me a victim anymore. And yes, I do know that this is not going to be a perfect ""thing.""  I know that there are going to be days when the past trauma in my life will affect my eating. That's what trauma does. It's very inculcated in me. Those intrinsic messages are not always easy to get rid of. But I will continue to fight and I know Jehovah God will continue to help me. While I was in there, I used one of the groups that we had in the eating disorder group, to help me write a poem that I intend to post a little bit later when I have more time. But for now, I am just glad to be back and I am going to do my best to follow my meal plan and keep living.

They worked as a team, and I believed in them, that they cared about me. They made me feel special. I suppose that helped boost my self esteem too. Then I have body work done on my neck and back for a few years. I also saw a dietician and a holistic Dr who weighed  and counseled me weekly. I swam laps at a pool and had a gym trainer. All these things combined worked a miracle on my body, mind, and health in recovering from a bad case of obesity/low self esteem following a break up w/ a guy I had dated.  I was with him for the most youthful yrs of my 20's.  I had to workout to grieve the years I wasted on dating him while and following college. In working on ME I forgot about HIM.I returned to work a year after recovering from obesity and worked PT. I loved working, and volunteering.

I stopped all of the purging and fasting and binging almost 10 years ago and only just recently am I realizing that I'm not recovered at all. My thoughts became distorted from the very beginning (if they weren't already) and now I'm realizing what problems they have caused. My ideas and thoughts regarding confidence and body image and food and health & well being and literally everything about myself are so far from where they should be. I need professional help for that, that's for sure. I don't dare tell anyone this and in fact, the only person that knows about anything of this is my ex.

603,Magicalmermaid,04/24/2020,Anorexic voice ,"So yesterday I had therapy at the eating disorder clinic and I've just kinda figured out that I have an anorexic voice. It's the voice that sets the rules for food, the calories, the times. What I should and shouldn't eat. It's the voice that tells me I'm too fat and everyone else is thinner. It's the voice that tells me I'm not exercising enough. It's the voice that tells me I have to purge after I eat or I'll get fatter and no one will like me. It's the voice that tells me nothing bad will happen becuase I know what I'm doing. I'm too fat to be anorexic I'm too fat too need help. It's the voice that once I reach a target weight tells me I'm not good enough. But while the voice to everyone else might not be real. Its very real to me. Sometimes is screaming loud and I can't think of anything else. When I try to eat the voice is there. Do I really want to gain weight?
 Do I really want to cover the bones I've worked so hard to see? When the doctors and health care professionals tell me I'm anorexic and it's getting dangerous. That voice tells me I'm too far to be anorexic im fine and I'm definitely not in any danger. But this whole time I didnt realise that it wasnt my voice it was the anorexic voice. Because my voice is the unsure one in the back of my mind telling me this has gone one too long and this could be dangerous. Only that voice isnt as loud at the moment. Hopefully the more I try the louder it will get.",AndiTutti,"Fri,04/24/2020-6:46pm",I can relate ,"My nutritionist told me the same thing when I first met with her.

604,2Healthy4me,04/23/2020,Corona is Inducing a Loss of Self Discipline and .......(A ReallyLong Vent),"followed by a few days of refusing food and fluid intake? Lately after I have even a small meal, my stomach has been distending out w/in minutes of having just eaten a simple meal.
Then I became so flustered that I wanted to see what happened if I had a full fledged food binge on all the foods I rarely allow my body to experience. I usually am a Control Freak over my body.
I even end up experiencing weekly vacations from Disciplined Eating and find myself on a loose supporting futon and shoving food into my orifice. I make a game out of my binge too.
Then I feel ashamed of having just made a muck of my totally disciplined body. Then I resort to using ED behaviors.
Then feel bad when my country is Now enforcing the rule that mouth must be covered if planning to exercise outdoors, if we must. Well I must, or my body is soon going to become out of control and my worst enemy.
I am experiencing bad cramps even b4 Im done binging. I still dont stop. I usually don't stop until something real walks in the front door, like my housemate.....Ughhhhh?
I recently went cold turkey off of my female hormones at my OB-Gyn's request. Not sure why but I'm supposed to drop a bunch of weight after going off The Pill.
I'm still waiting for that miracle to occur. In the mean time I'm sabotaging my body with this out of control binging.
I do believe that the binging is related to being on a mandatory vacation from my 2 careers. No more eating within a controlled break and meal time. All the time in the whirled to open up and begin sabotaging my body.
Why am I doing this. I need to stay within my size range as I am also a size model for my company. I'm totally going to lose my job as a fit model whenever I need to weigh in and have measurements taken for my next fitting.
I'm feeling like my body is splitting in 2 totally different directions. The direction of total control and career stability, and the other direction of being totally out of control over my body which feels like is rapidly gaining pounds and curves in places I never had problems with before.
What should I do. I have asthma and it's too challenging to take a walk outside w/ a mask covering my face.......
I just wanna go sleep until this entire PANDEMIC curse ends. I'm at my witts end, really hate feeling cornered, slowed down, and turned into a caged in hamster.
I feel like I'm ultimately becoming too reliant on snacks, in lieu of discipline and exercise, like before
Ughhhhhhh.",iwanttolive,"Thu,04/23/2020-8:00pm",iFast2eat,"Hi there.  I am not sure if we have posted to one another, but in any case it sounds like you are really struggling.  As Braveheart told me yesterday, even though Covid is out there, our mental health issues don't just miraculously go away.  In fact many people are experiencing more symptoms and those who didn't have any before this are starting to experience some.  I want you to know that you are not alone, but that I am also sorry you are struggling so much.  It is so difficult.  I myself am dealing with a increase in weight from binging and it is very upsetting.How long have you been modeling?  Do you think this contributes to the eating disorder struggles?  I would think it would be challenging to be weighed and measured as a requirement for work.  How do you deal with that?As far as the binges, do you have anyone you can ask for help?  I had to let my father know, who runs a food pantry and brings home ""goodies"" that even if I come to him on bleeding knees begging for stuff, to not give it to me as I am binging.  I saw a few cases of a particular food item on his porch and jokingly asked him for a few boxes and he said nope.  Under strict orders not too.  So if you have support it may make it easier.Where do you live that they may be requiring you to wear a mask outside?  I know there are masks that you can get for ten dollars of so that have a respirator on them that makes it easier to breathe and doesn't fog up glasses.  That might help you go out and be able to breathe and not have it bother your asthma.   These are definitely very trying times.  A lot of people out of work, routines changing.  One thing that may help is to stick to a schedule as much as possible.  Go to bed at the same time, get up at the same time, shower, dress, try to eat at the same time every day if possible.  Setting a few small goals everyday.   This might help.  I hear everything you said and I am sorry that the binges are as ferocious as they have been.  Did you deal with binge eating before this?  Please know you are not alone.  I am glad you reached out for support.  We are all here for each other.  Please let us know how you are doing. I also wanted to say that this is dangerous.

612,silverstars,03/22/2020,Recovery without a meal plan,"i left treatment after just a few days almost a whole year ago.i do regret leaving,i have to wonder if i really would have recovered had i finished the entire inpatient and day patient programs.i am so ashamed that i made such a rash decision.But what is done is done.
For a few months after that,i actually was doing a lot better on my own,but last August i really slipped backwards.
i have an amazing pyschiatrist who is also my therapist.At the time i also had a case manager who obviously had never worked with someone with an eating disorder,saying things like,""Your face has really filled out."" ""You ate all of that in one sitting?!?""She asked me how much weight i had gained,which was triggering and really none of her buisiness.She sent me info on a gym,fitness classes,and a cooking class.
i ended up firing her.Anyway!
i did gain some weight,which was hard to get used to,but i felt really motivated to get better.i truly thought i could do it on my own.i was,admittedly,still not eating in an ideal way.i had no meal plan.Can't find the one from the hospital.
i don't have a dietician because,here in my province in Canada they are not covered by the provincial health plan and i just can't afford one.But,it is just as i said in my inpatient assessment,i need to learn how to eat because i have no idea how.
When i said that to my mother she said,""Can't you just teach yourself?""
No,clearly i can't.i don't even think this post has a question,so i hope it is ok that i have rambled on.At first i did not at all want a dietician,having had some bad experiences with a couple in hospital in the past,but now i am thinking that it may be hard if not impossible to recover without the guidance of a dietician who is an expert in eating disorders.Yes,i have a wonderful GP,and my therapist is amazing,but i still need to just simply learn how to eat,and i don't see how that can be possible without more support.i also know that it is hard if not impossible to recover in isolation so i am very glad i found this forum.",youarebeautiful,"Sun,03/22/2020-12:06pm",You are valid,I honestly am having the same problem regarding recovery and meal plans.

A day program may help you get the structure you need as well as learn the skills you feel you are lacking to be bale to manage this difficult disorder on your own. If you are not interested in re-entering into. program or that is not an option, you could certainly try a different dietician. Just l like all support systems you have to find one that is right for you and it sounds like you just haven't experienced that yet. If you truly feel that is the best next step maybe looking into different resources for nutrition would be helpful.",silverstars,"Tue,04/21/2020-2:49pm",Thank you BNH2020,"Thank you so much for your support and validation.
i have a feeling that if i asked to go back into the day program they would want me to do inpatient first.
i would be willing to try again,but life circumstances right now would make that impossible.

614,WeebleSF,04/17/2020,Medically Induced Anorexia and Severe Fear of Food,"At 37, the confluence of two auto-immune disorders resulted in a year of medically-induced anorexia. I dropped significant weight over several months and landed in the ER.
I'm now managing my conditions but have an abject fear of food. One of my conditions, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), is a relatively new disease and one that indicates severe allergies to food. However, there are no tests that are accurate to identify what you're allergic to and instead you have to take the long arduous journey down an elimination diet.
So, eating disorder meet elimination diet meet abject fear of food that can cause some serious side effects.For the last year EVERYTHING I ate made me sick. It got to the point where even drinking water made me so nauseas. Now, in quarantine, I have a completely controlled environment and control 	what I eat. The issue with this is that I'm truly afraid of food. Now, don't think I'm crazy because logically I know this is nuts, but my body doesn't seem to think so.
How do I desensitize myself to food(s)? I'm still malnourished and am trying to add in new foods for more variety.
I need to eat more. A full stomach makes me feel uncomfortable.  Best suggestions for adding density to meals?
I'm eventually going to need to work on the social aspect of this disease once I'm out of quarantine. How do I even begin approaching food prepared by others?
Lastly, one of the medications I'm on to increase my appetite (I have none) and mitigate the nausea has a nice little side effect - mania. On top of all the nutritional issues I'm having, I run and deal with akathisia.",Tryingtoheal,"Fri,04/17/2020-4:42pm",Unfortunately ,"you may have to endure being uncomfortable with eating to get better.

615,Courtnw11,04/18/2020,Bulimic in Treatment for Alcohol - Struggling,"Hi all, My name is Cece and I am a struggling bulimic. I am currently in a Sober Living House to try and get clean from alcohol and other drugs. Life was getting pretty miserable with everything that was going on. I am happy to say I am almost 40 days sober; however, I am still struggling with my eating disorder in here, probably worse than I was before I came. I think the absence of drinking intensified my fear of having to feel and deal with all of my emotions. I am sober but I feel like my ED is just another drug and delusion to get me through each day. It's like a comforting friend and I am so so scared to let it go and be alone with myself and my thoughts.I'm not sure what I am looking for here, my therapist showed me this forum and recommended reaching out to others so I don't feel so alone in this, kinda like I did with the alcohol. Maybe I just need some encouragement? Some hope I guess? I am at a loss again and feel almost as bad as I did when I was back in my apartment, drinking and binging and purging every night to escape, wanting my life to be over because I'm so sad and distressed in my body and my mind.I have thought about going into an impatient treatment program but I do not have insurance and sure as hell don't feel ready. I just don't know what I'm waiting for exactly, either. Thanks in advance for any suggestions or support.",iwanttolive,"Mon,04/20/2020-12:14am",Courtnw11,"Hello and welcome to the forum.  I am glad you reached out.  First, congratulations on being sober for almost forty days.  That is a big deal and you need to give yourself credit for that accomplishment.  I have not dealt with drugs or alcohol but I have dealt with self harm and eating disorders.  I don't really believe there is too much different with addictions, however they are packaged.  They all serve a purpose, usually to avoid pain, or to help us deal with things we think we can't deal with so we hide in the addiction.  I think you are right in that since you stopped using and are in a sober house the eating disorder is kicking in more to compensate for not having the alcohol or drugs.  To me, food is a drug.  Or can be used as one.  It is vital for life, yes, but when misused, it can be, in my thinking, used like a drug.  To anesthetize pain, numb out, and fill in the blank.I am sorry you are struggling with this.  It is very dangerous though.  You can die from bulimia and anorexia.  Both are very serious and life threatening.  I say this not to scare you but to alert you of how dangerous they are.  I hope you get support and help for this as you are for the alcohol and drugs.  It is vitally important that you have support as it is very difficult to overcome on one's own, and since you already have addictions, this is one more to face.  In healing from the alcohol I am sure you have had to figure out why you were using it, what purpose it was serving.  I think that you may need to do the same thing with the food.  It is probably the same thing.  It is usually more than one thing.  As for me, I was very ill for most of my life.  I am fifty-two and struggled with depression and anxiety since kindergarten and the eating disorder started around fourteen or fifteen.  I did well for a year, but then started struggling again.  Right now the problem is bingeing or over overeating, and then the subsequent weight gain and then depression over the weight gain and then I lose the weight.  So the cycle continues although not like it was.  I am a Christian and my faith has helped me a lot.  Just these past two days have been especially difficult but I was able to call a friend and make commitments to stay safe.  I was able to use some DBT skills and stay safe.  I say all this to let you know you are not alone.  Our struggles may be a little different but similar at the same time.  Recovery is possible.  It is a journey, not a sprint.
Again, I am glad you found us and I hope my post was a little bit helpful.  I am proud of you for all the work you have put into your sobriety.  Now it is time to look at the eating disorder and get help for that.  I don't know what that will look like for you, but NEDA has resources and if you get in touch with them they may be able to assist you with finding help.  For now,

I understand the fear. What I am about to say will sound overly simplistic but here it goes;  Do it afraid.  I warned you it would sound that way, but the more you restrict the more power it has over you. I completely understand your fear. I loved that way for decades. Moses, in the Bible had a scary situation.  The Egyptians were after them and the Red Sea was in front of them. Nowhere to go, trapped. But he took a step of faith and put his foot in the waters and BAM!!!  The waters parted and the Israelites walked through the parted waters on dry land. Once they were all crossed over, the waters came together wiping out the enemy. If Moses didn't take that step of faith, and I would make a bet, he was afraid. I know the fear.

I know what it feels like to feel that you're at rock bottom. In the fleeting moments when you don't feel depressed, what are you doing or thinking of? Is it a good distraction that pulls you out of that mindset? If so, make a big effort to keep doing whatever it is that helps. Hopefully, you'll eventually realise that you want to get as far away as possible from whatever's causing the depression/anxiety. I say to myself in my head in a big, bold, loud voice ""I DON'T WANT TO FEEL LIKE THIS ANYMORE! I WANT TO MOVE ON! I'M GOING TO TRY TO MOVE ON!"". I then get busy with distracting myself, whether it's through reading, learning something new or talking to someone. Perhaps research or make a plan or do steps to work towards something that you want to achieve in your life (not in keeping with what the ED wants). Do you have any academic or career goals? I'm guessing the Covid-19 lockdown situation prevents you from doing some things but I guess you could research what you can do when lockdown's over. Achieving something outside of the ED is more useful & beneficial in many ways than achieving something that the ED wants you to do. You'll gain a great sense of worth, which should help conquer the depressive thoughts.

626,alwaysthinking,04/14/2020,I threw it on Him,"Warning: This may be long. So as I had posted previously, as of yesterday, I was pretty sure that I wasn't going to get in anywhere. In Ohio, there are two places only that have inpatient treatment centers. And I was told that neither one accepted both of my insurances. And then the one place that sounded like they probably would accept me is out of state and they are not taking anybody out of state because of COVID-19 right now. So yesterday, was pretty blasted awful. And I was feeling absolutely miserable and hopeless as usual. And I knew that My eating disorder therapist was going to call me at some point in time to update me on her searches. And when she did, it didn't sound any more positive than what I had already done. But then she did let me know, that the one place in Ohio was going to accept Medicaid, after all, once they discovered that this was for eating disorder treatments. They said that since treatment for eating disorder is so scarce, they are usually able to bill Medicaid as a secondary and get it paid for. So my therapist told me to call that place and do an intake because they were expecting me to call. Which I did. And she also faxed over my lab work to them. And I thought that the entire conversation was indicating that it was pretty much a no-go. I can't go into too many specifics because of the regulations here. But they had a short waiting list and it just did not sound like it was very likely that I would be getting in anytime soon. So, I had already had the most miserable day of my life because of trauma related aspects and other things were just awful eating disorder wise. And I just lost it. Once I got off the phone I was bawling my eyes out as usual. And I just prayed as earnestly as I possibly could.  Because bottom line, I had no idea what was going to happen now. It sounded like no hospital was available and I really didn't know what may happen. I did not want to be a fatality obviously. But to me it sounded like COVID-19 might take another life in a totally different way. So I just prayed that Jehovah would know the best thing that needed to happen and I went to bed very early because I was emotionally and physically exhausted. And I left it in His very capable hands.  Well, because I did go to bed so early, as in 5:00, I awoke by 11:30. (I seldom get more than 6 hours of sleep.)  And I was first intending just to do a couple of things and then try to go back to bed. But I could tell that I was in a totally different mind frame, immediately.  And I also knew I was wide awake. So I stayed awake and did my normal Bible stuff that I do first thing in the morning. I also started on a couple of other activities, but the most important thing was that while I was doing my Bible ""stuff,"" a lot of thoughts were running through my head very rapidly.  And then when I was doing the treadmill, (I always pray when I do that in the morning), I was able to tell Jehovah God that for the first time ever, I was giving Him my stupid eating disorder, and I didn't want it back.  Psalm 55:22 says, ""Throw your burden on Jehovah, and He will sustain you.  Never will He allow the righteous one to fall.""  So that's what I did. I threw it on Him.  And I told Him, You take it. And don't ever give it back to me. And it was a totally different feeling. And today I was able to eat breakfast 100%, and I was starting to eat my morning snack, and I was working on doing the ministry. And I was feeling so positive about everything. And I had also decided that forget it. I am not letting anybody control me ever again. Because bottom line, that's what's been going on. The eating disorder has been controlling me. Because I've been having flashbacks. And so basically my father is controlling me. And it's also my mother is controlling me because of the flashbacks as well. And hearing my old name in my flashbacks is making me feel out of control. And it's just a conglomeration of everything. And I was just feeling like a victim. And I said today, this morning, no more!  I refuse to be a victim! This is ridiculous! I even wrote out my own PHP. I had the whole schedule written out; what my ""groups"" would be and of what they would consist.  And I was saying I don't need a hospital because I will get through this with Jehovah's help and I can do this. I am in control because I am relying on Jehovah and He is always in control.  And then the phone call came. It was that same hospital with whom I had done the intake yesterday. And they asked me how soon can I get down there for an intake and have admissions? And I was asking, um, what?  I was completely mind blown. Because I thought maybe they were just saying I needed to come down there and do an intake, and then they would make an assessment.  And so I said that to the person because I wanted to have a clarification. But then she said, no we want you down here and you will do an intake when you get down here because then we need to admit you for inpatient.  And then she said, can you get here tomorrow? And so since 9:30 this morning, I have been running around like a head with my chicken cut off.  Yes, I say everything backwards :-)  And doing everything I can to tie up loose ends and get packed and everything else. So that is why this is the first time I've been able to get on this site since very very very early this morning. And unfortunately, this place is not have internet access. So I also will not be able to look on here while I am inpatient.   I do hope to get on here one more time before I go to bed, but I at least wanted to let everybody know the news. And I anticipate doing wonderfully there. Because I gave my stupid eating disorder to Jehovah and He's not giving it back!!",iwanttolive,"Tue,04/14/2020-6:30pm",Wow,"I am really happy that you are finally getting treatment.

629,CRacrofaerie82,04-04-20,Accessing treatment on Medicare,Hi Folks! So I'm posting here because I'm trying to reach out wherever I can to try to find out if anyone has successfully accessed treatment with Medicare as their primary insurance and how the COVID virtual options are affecting folks. I had to move across the country for a sec 8 voucher so I could be housed but unfortunately it meant I lost all access to treatment because Massachusetts is a state that doesn't provide ED care for folks on medicare/medicaid with the only treatment provider I've found to work for me- ERC. I have tried local care providers and it has made my situation worse so now I just have no care. Has anyone found that there are more virtual options open or been able to access different programs across the country they maybe weren't able to access before? I want to feel hopeful but this whole COVID thing is a nightmare for accessing care both with other chronic health needs and with ED. Our city has made all sorts of initiatives for substance abuse but I don't have that and I find there's nothing comparable for EDs. What have you all done to try to advocate for more options/care?Thanks for reading!,alwaysthinking,"Tue,04/07/2020-9:12pm",Massachusetts doesn't have,"Massachusetts doesn't have any Medicare/Medicaid programs for e.d. treatment? Have you researched this thoroughly? I'm not doubting you; I'm only asking, because, at first, that's what I thought was going to be my issue, as well (I live in Ohio), but I contacted NEDA, and they did find two providers who do accept both insurances.  And one was accepting new patients.  They  both are two hours away from where I live, but I get gas vouchers, so I didn't care.   I like driving!! (Of course, now, it's just over the phone.)  Anyway, if you haven't already, I would just thoroughly investigate every option and contact NEDA, also.  Otherwise, I don't know what to tell you.

630,alwaysthinking,04-09-20,Getting help,"I emailed my eating disorder therapist yesterday. I had asked her that if she had the opportunity and time to give me a call if she could. I told her that there was something I should have told her last week that was of the utmost importance. And lo and behold, after I finished an earnest, supplicating Prayer to Jehovah God, where I was bawling out my eyes as usual, she called. We had about a 10 to 15-minute conversation where I told her everything. It took a lot of strength, which I know came from Jehovah, of course.  But I got through it. And she said she would start calling various inpatient hospitals, if that's what I wanted.  And I had to tell her, that I really had no idea what I really wanted. Because in my eating disorder mind, getting better means getting fat again. And so I was at least able to tell her, that I am not in full capability of my faculties. So I told her to do what she thought was best. And she said she would start making the calls. And one teeny, little itty bitty part of me is glad. The one part that just wants to be serving Jehovah. I hate that it's so tiny right now.  I hate that my Eating Disorder's voice has become so absolutely huge and boomingly loud.  But at least I'm still hearing the one little voice that wants only to be serving Jehovah.  And then there's the lab work that my psychiatrist ordered. I looked at the results today. One part of me is scared. But it really goes along with how I've been feeling today. I've been so lethargic, absolutely freezing, even though my apartment is registering 77 degrees, and bottom line, I am just starving. So all of that made me beg Jehovah to help me have the strength to eat a ""reasonable,"" ""normal"" meal, without recording it and without counting calories. Which I did. And very soon after I was absolutely terrified, mortified, and very soon, I was engaging in yet another e.d. behavior. And when I was, I was feeling very weak, numb, and tingly. I am scared. More than I've ever been before with this entire ordeal. I don't know what to do. So I'm leaving it in Jehovah's capable hands and hoping that and hoping that my therapist is able to find a placement for me soon. And I still don't want to get better. Because of what that means in my eating disorder mind.

632,cassismh,04-12-20,Please help me,"Hi,This is my first time ever doing this ( writing on a forum or even talking to anyone about this issue I struggle with, even my therapist who I have seen for 11 years does't really know I even have an ED).  I am so so so sad.  I struggle so hard with weight every single day of my life for the last 4 years it has consumed my existence.  If the scale is ""good"" then I'm good, but if its bad, anyone around me, which is usually only my mother because I'm too ashamed to go out (especially now with COVID, I live with my other and she is the only person I interact with), then its bad for everyone.  I am so nasty.  I started off with very restrictive eating back in 2016 and was very happy with the weight I got to, but I'm sure some fo you know, once the number keeps going down, you can not bear to see it go back up.  This fall I was at the lowest weight I've ever been since I was about 10 or 11 years old, and I loved it.  In the last 2 weeks I have gained X pounds,  I don't see how it is possible as I have not stopped purging and haven't binged more then typically.  I do think think I'm having a harder time purging then I normally do because I'm so frantic.  I am so lost and sad and I'm so alone I really just need some help.  I don't know what else I can do at this point I'm just so miserable.  All I can think about is thank god I don't have to go into my office right now lol butt I look horrible my face is puffy my stomach is huge and I just want to non stop cry but I also cant stop putting food into my mouth. I am ashamed, and embarrassed.  My family has called me out multiple times in the last few months and my mom has been calling me out unfairly which I honestly think makes it worse (obviously not her fault that the s is happening she just doesn't get it).

Today was the first time I thought seriously that maybe I do have an eating disorder and that I should do something about it.

I understand the part about your post about not having a purpose or drive without your ED. Perhaps consider the good things that could come into your life without the ED (e.g. easier social life, being able to better focus on studying or your career) & use those to set new goals for your life. That goal/those goals could be your motivation to recover. With regards to feeling things, I'm guessing that your ED has a role to play when it comes to bad feelings caused by non-ED stuff. When bad feelings come to me, I shout to myself in my head ""I want to get over this, I don't want to feel like this anymore, I want to move on"". I usually make an extra effort to distract myself in such situations by talking to someone about something else or burying my head in another world (through reading or a good film or TV show). If  you don't want your ED to make you feel scared/sad/anxious, get on the road to recovery now before it makes you change your mind. It could make you do something physically dangerous if you listen to it.",silverstars,"Mon,04/13/2020-4:12am","Thanks,carmelfudge","Thank you for your insight.

Making yourself throw up is a symptom of bulimia.",iwanttolive,"Mon,04/13/2020-1:53am",Magicmermaid,"Hi. I want to echo what Tryingtoheal said about eating disorders being more about the emotional state than numbers and weight. So much more goes on emotionally. The behaviors are how we cope with pain and keeps us from feeling. It is very common to think we are not sick enough even when we are told we are.
I am glad you are posting and encourage you both to keep on posting. I am not sure how much this is making sense but I hope it helped. iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She has experience with eating disorders and other mental health problems.i could not call her.
That felt too scary.
So i just now wrote her an email to inquire whether she will indeed work with me on a sliding scale,and that i am suffering from anorexia and really need help.
i saved it as a draft.
i haven't been able to send it and i am not sure why.
Maybe it is simple ambivalence.i am desperate for help,but i am terrified of giving up my eating disorder.
But i know it is only out to destroy me.
My pyschiatrist/therapist really wants to hear if i have reached out to this dietician by our phone appointment on Monday.i am so afraid though.
i am afraid of what it means.

Because bottom line, I know with myself, that is really what held me back for so long, and it's what is still hindering me from making progress.  Try to remember that, when you are feeling so down.

645,alwaysthinking,04-07-20,Why??,"I feel so awful right now. Today has been absolutely miserable mood wise. And then it just completely catapulted into whatever is worse than miserable after my session with my therapist.  My sessions with my trauma therapists are always difficult, obviously. That actually means that they're productive I've heard. But, when we were nearing the end, I don't even remember what we started discussing, but I know that I started to feel my normal telltale signs that I was about to have a flashback and dissociate.  My therapist could tell too, because I've had them so often in front of him, and he was doing everything he could to try to help me stay grounded. But that usually doesn't do any good anyway. But I really did not want to have a flashback at any cost. There was too much that was going to happen right after the session that I really had to take care of and I just did not have time to mess with this today. Anyway, one little part of my brain was able to start praying. And I could hear that part of my brain saying, ""Jehovah, please. Jehovah, please. Jehovah, please, help."" And I was able to start regulating my breathing and being able to look at my therapist and get grounded again. And actually, now I remember what was happening just prior to this. I was telling him that I couldn't understand why I just could not tell him a certain thing. And why I couldn't tell my eating disorder therapist about it either. And this is why I was about ready to dissociate. Obviously. But to my horror, the next thing I knew, I found myself telling him everything. And I do mean everything. And now I feel absolutely awful about it. Actually, I feel worse than awful and I really can't think of what adjective is going to describe that. But I have been in mass hysterics off and on all afternoon ever since, and it's been because of that.  And just to elucidate for those who haven't been able to understand to what I'm referring, I mean in reference to my recent anorexic behaviors.  Obviously, I can't go into as much detail as I did with him, but I did tell him in very graphic detail as to how much I've been restricting, how much I've been exercising, and also about buying the scale and weighing myself daily. And I also told him how much weight I've lost in just a week. He is hoping I'll be able to tell my psychiatrist whom I see on Thursday. And I don't know if I will be able to. My eating disorder therapist has been trying to make arrangements for my psychiatrist to get lab work done. I don't know if it's been arranged yet or not. I just know that I don't know when I will ever be able to eat ""normally"" again.  Because quite frankly, what I'm eating now feels like too much.  And I know that Maleficent, what I've named my eating disorder, is absolutely Furious that I told anybody about what I do. And I just feel like something absolutely terrible is going to happen now because of it. And quite literally, after my appointment with him, I honestly heard in my head a voice say, ""just stop eating completely.""  And I'm beginning to think that this is all a by-product of still not being able to deal with everything that my father put in my head. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't even know who I am. And what is my voice and what I really want. I know of course that I want to be teaching people about Jehovah God and about the hope for the future. But other than that, I have no idea whatsoever who I am. Why in the world did I tell my therapist about this?  And why did I email him the link to this post, also?",iwanttolive,"Tue,04/07/2020-9:28pm",alwaysthinking,"Hi.  I am so hearing your pain and fear.

One thing that I know is that even as a Christian, I was hospitalized twenty.seven times ranging from a few weeks to a year and then half way houses day programs. I think I did that wasn't for attention but out of fear of growing up and fear of people.  I was extremely fearful and the thought of another day was too much for me to comprehend. But with God's help U don't think like that anymore. It took a very long time to arrive but I did. I have also bought scales, then smashed them. I no longer have one because it is similar to having alcohol in the house of I was dealing with addiction. It made the vice grip so much tighter making it impossible to recover. I hope my sharing helps you know that sometimes it takes several inpatient stays to get up and stay up.

647,2Healthy4me,04-04-20,Measurement 4 Measurement !!!,"With all this time off from my 2 jobs, i have begun to grocery shop. The grocery store that i Discovered actually is spacious, well stocked, and very approachably inviting for a Positive grocery shopping experience. I am someone rather timid about being in stores, malls, dr offices, staff meetings, DMV lines, etc....So I went shopping and 1st went down every aisle i could possibly muster up energy to walk down. I got a Big Picture in my mind of how things were arranged on the store shelves.  Then I realized that the prices at this market were quite competitive compared to other nearby grocery stores. Especially with the,  ""Ding Dang Coronavirus"" on my mind. The spaciousness at this store was an extra plus to me.I stocked up on TP, and PPT's. This reminded me of an earlier time of my life when i had used certain ED aids to purge, quite often, and always needed to keep the household tp stocked up so no one ever saw a pattern of missing tp.OMG, the pressure began building up and I felt so excited to be in a huge store,  Fully jam Packed with ultimate binge foods,  and a few necessary food items i eat on Good Days too. I was tempted to purchase more bad foods than healthy foods. I gave into my food cravings and went home and ate Non Stop.I ate Rather Rapidly,within a brief amount of time, and consumed a lot of Unhealthy Food. After Eating my stomach immediately was Cramping Big Time. I felt woozy and like my heart was beating a bit on the fast side of normalcy for me. I normally have bradycardia, the heart beat rate of a turtle,  in other words...Then i thought back in Retrospect and realized that during my Binge episode, i had also downed quite a few cups or carafes, of house coffee. That too may have induced the feeling of a super fast heart beat. I'm Not sure,    oh well...Today i weighed myself on my house scale and was overwhelmed by the weight I have gained since having NOT worked for the past 2-3 weeks. I went to exercise directly after and in the middle of my workout it began to rain. It was too damn windy to use my umbrella too.I had to QUIT, and turn around and return to my dry, comfort zone of an apartment. I realized after returning home that i hadn't eaten normally since that episode a few days ago.I failed to eat Lunch and Dinner and realized too that i hadn't been using my lunch replacements as i always have at my 2 jobs. I feel really disappointed with my New weight gain, and terrified that my metabolism is all screwed up now from not being The Active lil Career Woman that i have been for the the last few yrs.I feel out of control. I cant even go walk after weighing myself as even the damn weather is controlling me. The other night my brother was listening to Trump's speech for a few hrs. The TV was a bit loud, and i was emotionally tired of this ""Big Speech"". After i took my PM meds my head felt light, and i thought i was gonna pass out. Thank God i did actually get sick to my stomach. After that,  I felt much better. Unfortunately this all happened on the day I went shopping and was a bit too excited, i suppose.I feel like this is ALL another sequel to a mini series. My anxiety and ED seem to have become Reactivated,   once again.(Like another episode of Dynasty...)As my passive, and pathetic life goes on,....Now What? Don't wanna do therapy all over again. I want to try to regain Total Control over this monster of an appetite/food obsession.Must overcome feeling fat, pathetic, and lazy. I am  currently out of work, and now acting out badly w/ an ED relapse. Can't afford individual therapy, to grossed out, and embarrassed feeling to even sit in on an ED support group, and even if i could, the government and CDC is  advising all group events to be cancelled until further notice!Ughhh, what will my next series of this soap, about a Workaholic woman,now experiencing Withdrawal from not Working her 2 jobs,    include next? I know, an ER hospitalization from overeating,  and managing to get a Big chunk of unchewed food caught in my throat?Gee, won't i be that Cat's Meow of the ER ward? No really---i can't go anywhere near a Kaiser building until this CV all blows off,  and i feel safe to go near a hospital, or Dr's office once again...They upped my monthly Cov CA health ins fee so I may be shopping for a different one, or next year,  even try a new plan.The Kaiser online pharmacy is just so convenient that I can't find a new plan just yet. I'm afraid I am used to things always being convenient for me.I thank God that I have been Blessed with this ability for a ""Comfort Zone"" so my anxiety hasn't gotten too out of control, and induced a  induce a major panik/heart attack so far.Thanks God.....",2Healthy4me,"Mon,04/06/2020-6:28pm",Thank you for your concern,"The day has passed since i experienced a dizzy spell and actually became ill to my stomach and thus was relieved after,, whatever had upset my body and mind,   had been eliminated.I thought i had a bad reaction to my meds on an empty stomach that night.

650,heythere,04-07-20,Just curious if anyone else feels this way,"Hey!!
So it's been a while since my last post on here (it was on a other acc) and honestly i havent been very well at all.... What i thought was just binges and restriction kind of turned into purging, which has led me to gain a lot of weight. I have never felt so bad in my entire life, even though this is not the heaviest i have ever been.
Covid 19 is being such a a pain..... For the first 3 weeks of confinement i have been bingeing like crazy ( as i have for the past few months), without purging cause i jus't can't do it if my mom is home, i feel way too bad.
Then this past few days i have returned to my very old habits of highly restricting my calories.... And i kind of feel like it's getting out of control even though it hasn't been that long ??? i know where this ends, with me in complete misery but not looking ''sick'' enough for any kind of recovery. I actually went to a nutritionist who gave a diet kind of even worse than the one i have now ????
I don't even know who i am anymore, i used to be so passionate about my carreer (dance) but i just can't seem to focus... food thoughts take all of my time.
So, I wanted to know if someone ever felt this thing that i have been thinking recently: what if i am just making all of this up?? what if im just looking for a problem, to make myself the victim??? what if this isn't really that important and i just want to be the center of attention??????
I kind of try to let a lot of people know that i struggle (except for my family, that's not happening anytime soon) and i don't know if it is in desperate need of seeking help or if i'm just trying to get their attention ????

I've only just started receiving help for my eating problems and my depression and one thing that I have realised is that just because I do not have the 'text-book', typical case does not mean my problems are any less valid.

651,London1621,04-07-20,Hi:),"This is what happened to me. My older sister would always call me fat, my parents said that I am not, don't listen to her. Then my dad had surgery and the doctor messed up on him and he ended up in a wheelchair. My mom said we were not allowed to talk about it. We had to move homes, I was so scared and upset, I started hiding food in my room and would binge eat, that voice kept saying to do this and I hated myself. I didn't know how to tell my parents, and I found this website and everyone has been very nice and helpful. I was sent to a ED treatment center, came home and I felt like I messed up my parents and sister's life. After hating myself and couldn't stop binge eating, I told my aunt and she found me a different Ed treatment center and I went and came back and it's okay now. My sister is still being mean to me, but I'm not binge eating. When I get upset, I feel that hurt and sadness and I find something to get my mind off of it for a while. My therapist is nice, it's online but I'm doing ok right now. Just wanted to share this with you because I'm not scared of this anymore. I'm me, not a eating disorder.

652,ashleycruise,04-06-20,Treatment decision,"I am going to try and make this short and sweet but that most likely won't end up happening. When I came back from college for Christmas break, I did PHP for 5 weeks and then AMA'd because I did not want to miss school. I made a huge decision to quit college volleyball and continue college as a regular student. I thought quitting volleyball would have been the answer to all my problems. But, my ED only got worse. I am now back home from college for good because of COVID. I am taking online classes full time and living at home. I love my family, but this is such a toxic environment. My family judges food like no other. They are constantly talking about the latest diet and how much bigger they look, or how they need to go out and exercise. It has sent me into a cycle of restrict, binge, purge. When I was at school I was engaging in behaviors every day or every other day. Side note: I put myself in treatment over Christmas break. I knew that I was only getting worse and decided to call a treatment facility. They got back to me and recommended I spend some time in Residential Treatment. Another side note, my family understands nothing about eating disorders and was barely involved in my treatment the first time. When I told my mom that they recommended Residential treatment, she freaked out, to say the least. She said, ""I think we just need to get you connected with someone who specializes in eating disorders and a nutritionist."" Meanwhile, I had both a nutritionist and ED therapist as well as a group I did in counseling services at school. She had no idea because she doesn't ask. The whole point of me giving you this back story is to get to the point when I say I do not know what to do. I don't want treatment, at all. I don't want to do any of it. Clearly my family doesn't think I need it/does not seem to care at all. It is hard to put myself into treatment when I feel like I am the only one supporting myself. And even then, half of me wants to get better but the other half is saying, ""Just keep dodging their calls, you don't need treatment."" I could just really use some advice on what to do right now because I am feeling very alone and lost.",alwaysthinking,"Tue,04/07/2020-9:16pm",Do you have any other,"Do you have any other supports in your life, that you are able to contact?

I have cycled through anorexia and bulimia in the past and in my adult years, have added binge eating disorder to the list. Having to shelter in place has shone a light on how little I have actually recovered and I am already back to my restrictive behaviors and trying to keep my intake under X calories a day to start (I know that's a lot but it is much less than what I usually consume). I tried purging this week and I couldn't. I tried eating all the ""bad"" foods first because, in a panic, I was terrified that I even thought I was ok to have those in my home. I am just really struggling and feel immense hopelessness right now. I even considered cutting again and it has only been a week like this. I don't understand how I have fallen so quickly.

I struggle with anorexia and have a really hard time eating in front of people. So having my family around 24/7 and no escape has made my food restrictions increase quite a bit. The important thing to remember is that falling back into worse states doesn’t undo any of the progress you made before. You can and will get through this. The state of the world right now with the virus and everything is a huge stressor and is impacting mental health in a lot of ways. That feeling of just drifting away is one I’m all too familiar with.

657,silverstars,04-04-20,How far i've fallen in a year,"Just about a year ago i ran from treatment.
It was a rash decision.i was scared and angry.
(Anger is always a tough one for me because i was simply not permitted to express anger as a kid.)
Anyway,i really regret it now.In fact i hate myself for it.i had a chance and i messed it up big time.So,the other day i was looking at my binder from the hospital,and a little piece of paper fell out.
It read,""i am doing this for me.""This is the right time."" ""i am worth it."" i am brave."" ""i am proud of myself.""At the suggestion of staff i had written these little affirmations to set on my trays to motivate myself.i forgot all about it.i believe i found it for a reason.i actually did pretty well on my own after leaving the hospital (Although thinking on it now i was still not eating normally) with the support from my pyschiatrist who is also my therapist,but that didn't last long.
i quickly fell deep into the eating disorder,and right now i am struggling so terribly that the person who wrote those words has dissipated.i have finally accepted the fact that i still need treatment in order to recover.i was kidding myself that i could do it on my own.i don't have a meal plan and dieticians here in my province in Canada are not covered by the provincial health plan and are very expensive.i did do a search for dieticians who will work on a sliding scale and i did find one in my city who does,and she also accepts pay what you can.Is there any point in contacting her now when i am certain she is not seeing patients because of the virus? i guess it couldn't hurt.i am i think,i hope,that i am ready to make a change,and i have accepted that i just cannot do this on my own.i simply have no idea HOW to eat.i really don't.i am either eating next to nothing or having massive binges where i hardly even taste the food.Anyway,i suppose there was little point to this post,i'm sorry.i am just so....so desperate right now and needed to write i guess.Thank you for reading if you have.",MSarah,"Sat,04/04/2020-4:30pm",You are brave,"You are brave to acknowledge that this is hard and is a problem, and it’s great that you are trying to seek help!

Because she was not sure when we’d be able to meet in person again and because she didn’t want to keep waiting (and neither did I), we have done phone sessions the two times we have met. Other internet platforms have not worked as well due to poor internet connections. It’s obviously not ideal for either of us, but it is still helpful to have that support, education and accountability from her.

661,alwaysthinking,04-03-20,Couldn't do it,"So couple days ago, I made a post entitled, ""control - whose?"" And on there I was talking about how I have reverted to  restricting And several other really awful, negative eating disorder behaviors. And I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to tell either one of my therapists.  Well, yesterday I did manage to tell my trauma therapist somehow. I don't know what made him even ask specifically, and I don't really know what made me tell him.   And just to clarify, all I really did was simply tell him how many calories a day I'm eating.  I didn't tell him about buying the scale or weighing myself. Or any of the other negative behaviors that I'm not really supposed to mention here. But, when I saw my eating disorder therapist today, And seeing her really isn't the appropriate way to say it because it's on my phone with its dinky little, idiotic Version of the internet that doesn't work right ever. And we ended up having to go to Just phone anyway. I digress. So during my appointment, It took forever to get anywhere for a while because I just really didn't know about what to talk. I knew of course logically about what I should talk. But I could not do it. And then when she finally asked specifically how my eating has been, and also how my body image has been, I simply ignored the first question and just went on to the body image part. And then she finally did get back to asking about how I've been eating. And I just said I've been restricting a lot. I didn't even say anything about a specific number of calories, Like I had told my trauma therapist. And I don't know why. But I honestly couldn't. As in unable. I could not get the words to come out of my mouth. So after talking for a little bit more, I mentioned how I have just been completely overwhelmed with the eating disorder. And how it's not just one little thing. It's every single aspect of the atypical anorexia. And I don't know where to start. I'm clueless. I'm completely lost. It's not just body image. It's not just being able to stick to a meal plan. It's not just anything simple. Like anything in my life ever is. It's just everything all at once all the time. Always right in my face. Blowing up at me. And I can't handle it. I don't know what to do. And I told her that I honestly feel like the eating disorder is consuming me. So she asked me if I was willing to take just one simple first step. And then she proceeded to say How about making that first step simply be eating breakfast everyday?   And I had a gigantic pause. And I had to say Well, that depends. Because I have been eating breakfast everyday. But it depends on what she wants me to be eating for breakfast. Because I know logically that I am not eating what I need to be eating. But I wasn't able to tell her that. I did say, The first part - it depends on what she is wanting breakfast to be. But I honestly could not bring myself to explain anything else. She point blank asked me, What did you have for breakfast today? What did you have for breakfast yesterday? And I couldn't answer her. It wasn't that I WOULD not answer her. I honestly could not.  I was unable to make myself answer those questions. And that's a total first for me. For any type of therapist, psychiatrist, Etc. I have never been anything less than open and honest with all of my mental health professionals my entire life. I've always known that I'm not going to get anywhere if I don't. And this is literally how this stupid eating disorder is taking over my life right now.  It has taken control over me. I did tell her that much - that I have been able to realize that there is a part of me that  has ""heard""  my eating disorder (whom I call Maleficent)  say that if I Follow all of these rigid rules and do all of these certain behaviors, then I won't have to be so erratic in all of my other mental disorders. If I listen to Maleficent, then my six other mental disorders will not be destroying me anymore. Because my life has been absolutely miserable recently due to of all seven of them. There has been absolutely no stability in my life because I have been having rapid wacky mood swings and everything has just been all over the place and I have been so overwhelmed because of all of it. And so Maleficent is saying well, listen to everything I'm saying and you will be perfectly fine.   And as I told Deb, my eating disorder therapist, I know that's a bunch of hooey. Because I know that I will not be in control. And it will not make things better. I recognize that Maleficent is in control. I have been in  3 inpatient hospital stays and I've heard enough patients say things like,  I just want to have control over my eating and then everything will be fine. And I know that they are not in control. Their eating disorders are. So I recognize yes, Maleficent is in control right now. And I feel powerless. I feel powerless to do anything about it. And I feel powerless even to rat her out to my therapist.   And at the same time, I think she may already know. Because my trauma therapist had asked me if Iwanted him to email her. And let her know about the certain calorie amount, and I told him I didn't want him to, but I think he may have anyway.   Just based on things that she was saying makes me suspect this.   If he did, I'm not upset. He has a responsibility to keep me safe. So this may be his way of doing so. I just still feel so lost. And totally helpless.",tryingtobebrave,"Fri,04/03/2020-10:10pm",Survival?,"I really can relate to not being able to tell your therapist. It’s  not that you won’t, it’s that you physiologically / somatically cannot. There’s fight, flight, and freeze. Maybe your brain chose freeze because with it being hard to communicate with your team over the phone, your brain doesn’t want your other way of coping, mallificent, to be taken away too. Ed maybe has convinced your brain you need it to survive and your brain made you unable to express it to them. Does that make any sense?For me this happens not necessarily related to Ed, but with other maladaptive behaviors and mental health symptoms. Like I know I need to let my psychiatrist know about my ocd behaviors, but I feel paralyzed because it feels like the only control I have consistently. Also during certain trauma triggers, I go slightly catatonic, physically cannot move or speak or respond. The only thing that helps is my anxiety medication when that happens.

662,silverstars,04-02-20,Appetite Cues,"Hello,everyone.So,for weeks and weeks severe anxiety caused me to completely lose my appetite.It was so difficult to try and eat.
i am wondering if my eating disorder latched on to the routine i got into as far as just not being able to eat.
i know i should have fought it,eaten on a schedule no matter what,but i didn't.
Now i am restricting heavily,and i honestly don't know how to get on track.Well,now my appetite cues have returned.Instead of being relieved and motivated to be healthy,i have not been honoring my hunger at all.
This year i find restricting much harder than it was last year when i lost a whole lot of weight.
So,that should be a relief as well,for now i could,if i allowed myself,i could eat when i am hungry and hopefully stop when i am full.
After a few days of restricting i end up consuming a huge binge,because i am just ravenous.i need to start listening to my body,but appetite cues scare me.i always fear i will lose control and eat everything in sight.So,how to embrace and honor my hunger?
How to stop,when i do eat,worrying about what i will weigh the next day?i wish i could get out of this trap of obsession and compulsions when it comes to my eating disorder.
i wish i could get out from under the misery of this illness.",alwaysthinking,"Thu,04/02/2020-11:23am",Same here,"I'm right here with you. So similar. In the same boat. Absolutely miserable, isn't it?",silverstars,"Thu,04/02/2020-11:29am",i'm sorry..,"i am so sorry that you can relate.

663,MSarah,04-01-20,Needlessly Worried?,"Hello All,I’m new to these forums, so I’ll just give a few lines about my background for context. Though never formally diagnosed early on, I’ve struggled with anorexia/food restriction for the last 10 years. In the last two years, I’ve sought out therapy for my depression, during which I have been able to open up about my eating disorder. In the last month, I’ve started seeing a dietician as well, so between my therapist, my dietician, my GP, and a mentor (all of whom know about my struggles), have a great support system. As I am new to this, I am often fearful about the physical consequences of chronic under-eating. I spent my late teens and now my entire adult life so far never fueling my body enough, and I’m just very disoriented. My GP has not said anything about my weight being too low, and I get regular periods now, but I lost them for about 3 years earlier on in my disorder, and while I know the body can often heal itself with proper care, I’m worried about the unseen damage, and I don’t know where to start. I guess my question is, what are good questions to ask my GP in addressing these issues, and has anyone had experience in working towards recovery where they’ve had long-term damage without realizing it (because at this point, I don’t know what it looks or feels like to have a properly-healthy body). Or do I just need to be more patient and let my body adjust as I go through recovery and then see what may still be an issue? I’m mainly worried about my heart health—as my chest sometimes aches—and my bone health, since I know that the time span with which I’ve struggled the most are important for bone development. I’m also a dancer who is getting back into ballet after time off while I was in college, so these are both important physical factors.Any advice, or even just experience or encouragement would be greatly appreciated at this time, as I feel particularly alone and apprehensive in this area of my life...Thank you in advance!",aqallan,"Thu,04/02/2020-8:53pm",Me too!,"Hello!

It was like I didn't feel any emotion for a year and a half and now I suddenly feel extremely overwhelmed by all the emotion since becoming more stable. I definitely understand being worried about your health, that is what drove me to reach out for help and try to get better. I talked to my doctor about it and they did some tests to make sure that everything was okay which was reassuring if you voice your concerns I am sure they will do them same! I am also learning the whole what it looks like and feels like to be healthy.
Very happy for you that you have such a solid support system and are seeking recovery :)",MSarah,"Sat,04/04/2020-12:37pm",Oh my goodness yes! All of,Oh my goodness yes!

I've never done therapy so I don't know what to expect... I am also starting to think therapy isn't for me. I had a bad session with one lady (not an ED specialist-- said triggering things) and I find this new woman I'm seeing to be a little weird. Therapists are supposed to be non judgemental and I feel like she's judging me. Also, she mostly just repeats what I just said and doesn't offer any advice. I've only had two sessions, so maybe she's just trying to get to know me? I feel like I should give her a chance but at the same time I don't want to waste my time and my parents' money.

I know  if someone really is a good therapist they are going to appreciate if you are willing to say something like, ""I'm getting weird vibes from you and it feels like you are only repeating everything. I say and being judgmental."" If she has a really good therapist, she will appreciate your being open and assertive by saying that.

I don't know if it helps at all but something that helped me to hear in terms of tracking is that our body needs vary so greatly from day to day based on so many factors (regardless of activity levels) that it is impossible for an app to be accurate in telling us our needs. I have tracked food for so long but when I heard that I was kind of like wow I need to give my body more credit because it will tell me what it needs. But I get it is hard to stop as well because I have also been struggling with wanting to turn back to tracking/meal plan especially in these quaratine days.,AndiTutti,"Wed,04/01/2020-9:02pm",I have heard that as well,"I have heard that as well-- and it totally makes sense! And seeing the numbers, this holds true. Some days I eat more than others.
I restarted my tracking in an attempt to restrict again, but I haven't been restricting lately (for the most part). With everything so out of wack lately, the sense of control in tracking is calming. I know I need to find better coping mechanisms, but knowing what I have eaten in a day is usually reassuring because I can see that I didn't eat the whole fridge-- in fact, far from it. Sometimes it feels like I'm eating way too much when in reality, I'm eating what a ""normal"" person eats (whatever that means).",aqallan,"Thu,04/02/2020-3:27pm",That is very true. I know the,"That is very true. I know the comfort and reassurance it gives for sure. It has been almost two months now since I last tracked (after tracking for nearly 7 years) and it is really hard to give up that comfort. Especially at first, and many days I feel like I am eating too much and then that would cause me to weigh myself but it's also been a couple of weeks since I stepped on the scale as well.

It took me a really long time to find this other woman and I definitely want to give her a few more chances.

But I definitely realize that they are all interconnected.  Something I was able to give myself grace about last night was in relation with the eating disorder and in relation to my faith. I really been struggling with feeling like I am not giving it to Jehovah God.  The scriptures say to throw your burden on Him, And He will sustain you. And I keep feeling like I keep taking it back. That I'm playing pitch-and-catch instead of just letting him take it. And so recently, I've been feeling really guilty about my eating disorder in relation to my faith. But to return to your subject, I was able to think about my other mental illnesses and kind of Do a comparison with them. Actually, I know Jehovah helped me do this. Because I was praying to Him while I did this.  Anyway, I have not really beaten myself up when I Have my gigantic amounts of crazy mood swings due to my bipolar and my borderline personality disorder. I know I can't do anything about it. I wish I could, but they just come willy-nilly whenever they want to. They hit and go to such extremes and I really have absolutely no control over them.  But I don't feel that it means that I'm not putting enough faith in Jehovah for it. And with my anxiety, even though I trust in Him to Help me with some things, I know there are various things that I just am always going to be anxious about and it's not my fault. It's my general anxiety disorder. So, it's kind of being Able to Simply give myself permission to realize that these things are not my fault. They are simply disorders of my brain  Over which I have no control. And I was finally able to realize the same thing is true with my eating disorder. Because recently it has been completely out of control. And I have been feeling so guilty, because I have felt like it is my fault. That I am doing something wrong. That I, personally, am to blame. And finally, last night I was able to realize, no, the eating disorder is in control.  And it really Is consuming me.  So I guess a really long version to answer your question is to say that a lot of long mental exercises helps me to get through all of this.  And ALWAYS prayer and complete Reliance on Jehovah God. I can't do anything without Him. I hope this is kind of the thing for which you were looking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because I read stories from people who had binge eating disorder before and had an episode once a week. And like... I can go for 10 days just binge eating all day. IS IT JUST ME? And I'm so scared and... Oof. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm looking for a friend. or several. that I can share my problems with them and that are going through the same thing. So that we can be each other's support system. If anyone is interested contact me...,tryingtobebrave,"Mon,03/30/2020-10:44pm",Not alone ,"Hi, welcome to the forum <3
We’re not allowed to give personal information on here, but you can post anytime and sometimes usually around at different times. We’re always here for you.
You’re definitely not alone in this. I’m 27 now, but my binge eating disorder started when I was 18-19. I also binged every day, multiple times a day some days.
I’ve cycled through a long period of recovery when I was 22, then developed anorexia and bulimia when I was 25. I finally got treatment then, and the underlying issues causing me to use my eating disorder to cope were addressed. I didn’t even realize some of it. Do your parents know? Are you able to see a therapist?
You can always reach out here. My grandmother recently died, and I’ve been binging daily again. I’m trying very hard to use the skills I’ve learned to cope, but it’s so hard the fight the impulse to binge sometimes.
You’re not alone here :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
676,alwaysthinking,03/30/2020,Want to/Don't want to,"I'm really tired of this. One minute I'm really wanting to get help  And beat the stupid eating disorder. And the next minute I'm wanting to give in to it again. I've gone two days with doing 100% of my meal plans. I was able to go  both of those days with being in a really good mood for almost  the entire day. But nearing the end of yesterday, I could tell I was slipping into a really negative mood again. It was because I was reliving a past memory. I'm so tired of the past haunting me. I'm so tired of the past  destroying me. I want so much to live. And yet at the same time, it seems like I'm ready to just give in and give up.  It almost seems like it's desirous to become so sick, that I either  have to be in the hospital because of  my anorexia or even worse, die from it. And I feel traitorous saying it. It feels like I am an awful person just to voice it out loud. Because I'm doing this voice to text on my phone. Makes me feel like I'm not  having enough faith in Jehovah God and that I'm not letting Him  Be there for me. I know I need to talk with my elders about this. And yet they're so busy trying to help the entire congregation  because of everything going on with the recent developments, due to the COVID-19 stuff.  So I feel like I'm not worthy of their time. But then, I never feel worthy of anything anymore. I made a sign yesterday that I put on my treadmill to try to remind me  of why I need to stick to my eating plan and not give in. It says, in order to save the world, ( By doing my Ministry) I have to eat. And then I made another sign that I'm trying to finish, that says the ""real me"" wants to live. And yet, it's so hard to feel this way all the time. And I'm so tired of giving it to this feeling. I'm so tired of these two opposite feelings constantly battling each other. I'm so tired of my life. And yes, I'm bawling the entire time that I am writing this. Because this is such a dilemma and such a constant struggle. I hate this fight. I hate all of this. I want to do what is right and it is so hard. I don't know how to keep fighting. I want to but I don't know how. I ate breakfast today, but I don't know how I'm going to eat any other of my meals. And I'm sure I'm going to exercise like crazy today. I hate this thing.",AndiTutti,"Mon,03/30/2020-2:07pm",I'm so sorry,"I'm so sorry you are struggling so much. I can relate to feeling pulled in two opposite directions, and I agree that it's exhausting and doesn't seem worth it sometimes (or quite often really). I don't have anything to offer in the way of advice, I just wanted to say I hear you. And I'm sorry.
Congratulations on eating breakfast though! I always find breakfast the hardest for some reason and it's definitely a win when I eat it. I hope you continue to stick to your meal plan.  I'm rooting for you! And if you haven't stuck to it, know you can get back on track at your next meal/snack time. What I've learned is it's okay to mess up as long as you get back on track as soon as you can. Virtual hugs. We will get through this",alwaysthinking,"Mon,03/30/2020-5:23pm",Messed up everything,Like I figured I would.  Reverted back to some unhealthy behaviors and habits.   I did talk to two of my elders.

It’s like I’m constantly at war with myself, fighting to do the right thing, fighting to stick with recovery. But then my mood crashes and I engage in self destructive behaviors of various kinds, heck I even watched an extremely triggering show about eating disorders when I was feeling horribly depressed a few days ago. Then the next day, I’m at peace. The cycle of fighting your own mind is exhausting. I really believe this is trauma related in some way. Being strong and wanting to fight and live, then hours later wanting to give up and not caring what happens to you.
I love you and I’m here for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
677,Stajo2012,03/30/2020,Regretting admitting that there's a problem,"I have been binge eating for a long time. I have gained weight over the past couple of years due to binge eating.I have finally admitted to having a problem and I feel as if I'm struggling more. There are probably several underlying issues to address as to why I binge eat, but I thought that finally admitting it would help. I finally came clean to my boyfriend of 9 years. I came clean to my mother. I came clean to my doctor. I came clean to my sister. My boyfriend wants to help, but doesn't know how. My mom listens, but offers no support. I think my sister is so wrapped up in her own life that she does not care. My doctor was extra supportive. She recommended a book for me to read. She gave me papers to get a psych consult. And she was the first person to tell me that she was going to help me beat it. She talked at length with me, even though she had other patients to see and for that, I am so grateful.The issue is that now, nobody is accepting new patients. And the service that I reached out to for help on finding where to go with my psych consult has not responded in over a month. We are quarantined. My work is closed for the time being. My anxiety is off the charts. And I am by myself all day, every day. No one checks in.So I binge. I try hard not to, and I am in a constant state of panic over it lately. I want to eat because I'm genuinely hungry. But I don't want to let myself eat, because if I do, I know what it will lead to. But then I give in, because I shouldn't just not eat. But then I binge. I binge until I'm overly full because for some reason, even though I feel sick from how much I ate, I feel comforted. And then I feel bad, angry, sad. And telling my boyfriend has just made me feel worse. I constantly worry on whether he is judging everything that I put into my body. With it being a nice day yesterday, I suggested that we got get dessert and him, thinking that he was helping me to not binge, shot the idea down. Which made me mad, and then hurt, and then embarrassed. He doesn't understand that the binging doesn't happen when he's at home. Of course I don't want him to see that. I sneak snacks when he isn't looking, but the bulk of the binging is before I go to work, in my car. After work, in my car. His solution is that we just don't keep groceries in the house, as if that helps. Like I won't just get in my car and go have a field day and then make sure to toss the evidence at the gas station before I go back home.He is trying to help but I feel worse. I feel like there is constant judgement being masked as concern. We have not been intimate in a couple of years and I know it's due to a lot of weight gain. This is starting to consume me. I can't think of anything other than binging, or trying to not binge, or feeling bad about a binge. The way my body now looks is consuming me. I avoid public functions. I hate going to work because I dwell on how I look. I feel like everyone is constantly judging me. The anxiety and health problems that are coming along with it are terrifying to me. And I am quickly going in the direction that my grandmother and now my father are heading towards...death associated with obesity problems. I need help. I need a friend, which I don't have at this moment. I am alone and lonely and tired and sad and guilty and ashamed.I just want the suffering in silence to end, but I don't want the judgement masked as concern.I'm tired of fighting this.",tryingtobebrave,"Mon,03/30/2020-10:34pm",Hey,"I’m really sorry you’re going through this. I think you did the right thing by coming clean about it, it takes courage. There are resources on the NEDA sight to help family members better understand. It took my family a looong time to accept my eating disorder.
I had binge eating disorder when I was 19, but wasn’t receiving any help because I was living in a violent home.  After I got out of that situation, I stopped binging but slowly started becoming consumed with losing weight.
When I was 25, I was diagnosed and got treatment for anorexia and bulimia. It’s taken so much time to come to terms that my recovered body is bigger than I’d want it to be. The BMI says I’m overweight, but both doctor and dietitian said my weight is fine.
My grandmother recently died, and I’ve been constantly binging lately. I relate to eating to the point where it makes you sick, but you can’t stop and it gives you a feeling of comfort. Addressing underlying issues helped me a lot in recovery.
You’re not alone. I’m here for you. We’re here for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

679,sarah.jones,03/27/2020,Im not really sure,"<p>I am completely new to this, and to start I would like to say I'm not even sure if I have an eating disorder, all I know is something isn't right. Ive struggled with a lot of things in the past, self-harming and suicidal thoughts. The centre of those issues I've found is accepting myself. Recently I've gained a lot of weight and I'm not comfortable with it, I've developed stretch marks all over, and I keep on restricting myself and then binging and the cycle continues I'm not sure what to do about it, my weight is not significantly above or below average when it fluctuates, however, my mental health is suffering from being very unhappy with how I look. Because my weight isn't dramatically different from the average person it prevents me from thinking I have an eating disorder however my cycle of eating makes me think I do, does anyone have any advice or tips for recovery?</p>",alwaysthinking,"Mon,03/30/2020-6:33am",Weight,"Hi.  I just wanted to let you know that weight alone  Does not determine whether or not you have an eating disorder.  Behaviors, mentality, and things like that really determine more than just weight. I definitely would encourage you to seek out professional help. Which of course is difficult right now with the COVID-19 thing going on.  I don't really have a lot of advice but I definitely to empathize and sympathize with you. I've been there in the past and I definitely I do hope that you get help.

I was so weak last night I could barely get off the couch, and my hair is coming out.
At my last appointment they said that my heart can't take more weight loss. But I still am losing.
Meanwhile, insurance won't cover inpatient treatment (accept at a facility 2 hour a away with a 2,month waiting period) and PHP programs are shut down.
I feel hopeless. I'm afraid that my anorexia will kill me before I can get help. All because of insurance and COVID-19 and bad timing.",alwaysthinking,"Sat,03/28/2020-8:30pm",Crying,My heart is breaking for you.  I'm so very sorry.

681,alwaysthinking,03/27/2020,I want to be WHOLE ,"I had an appointment  With my therapist today over the phone. We try to do it with Telehealth. But the video kept cutting out so we had to just finish it over the phone. Actually the majority of it was with the phone. The systems keep getting overloaded around here because so many people are doing these things. Anyway, I've just been so completely overwhelmed with everything. And I have really been struggling with eating as usual. But one thing that I was able to tell her is that I am just really feeling super defective again. Actually, I don't know when I ever don't feel Detective. But one of the things that was contributing to this is that I'm constantly feeling like there are so many ""parts"" of me.  Especially because I was telling her how I can be bawling my eyes out, And then someone happens to call me on the phone, and instantaneously, I  undergo this miraculous change without even realizing it. I don't do it consciously. But suddenly I am this super happy, super funny, laid back, everything is perfect with my life person. And I'm acting like there is absolutely nothing wrong and helping everybody else. And I have just  Transformed into this person that is completely unlike who I was 10 seconds ago. I am not doing this purposefully. I am just somehow automatically being really cheerful with everybody with whom I speak on the phone. And they have no idea of that as soon as I get off with them, I'm bawling my eyes out again. And the thing is, this is how I used to be when I was in school. But then I did it consciously. Because I never wanted people to know how I truly was feeling. I was afraid that if people knew how totally messed up I was, then they never would like me. I was afraid that if I let people into my head, if they knew how depressed I was, then they wouldn't like me. But when I first started getting treated for my various mental issues, and I started to learn more about my problems, I was able to realize that this is not helping me. And I decided at one point in time, that I was never going to do that again. I literally promised myself that I would NEVER Pretend to be something  Or act like I was feeling something that I truly wasn't. And I have never gone back on that promise to myself. And yet recently it's seeming like there's a part of me that is. So when I was telling Deb this, She asked me do you hear yourself? And I said, what? And she said, it's like there's a part of yourself that is trying to protect you. She was saying that there is a part of me that is trying to protect me from getting hurt again. And I immediately started bawling again. Because I'm so sick of there being parts of me. I have entirely too many problems already. I don't need to feel like I am split into a million different pieces. My trauma therapist had said something just yesterday, similar to this. When I told him that I was done needing to do my Body Talks, because I don't really feel that they're necessary anymore, He did allude, however, to the fact that there are parts of me still.  He even asked me if I agreed that there are parts of me that may feel one way and parts of me that feel another way entirely different. And I had to agree with him. But I don't want to. Because I'm so tired of feeling completely split into thousands of different pieces. I want to be whole; I want to be integrated.  I want just to be myself; one person - ME!  I'm so sick of this!!  Everything is so frustrating. It's even like when I emailed my eating disorder therapist later. I was telling her about a thought process that was going through my head. I had talked to one of my closest friends a little bit later. I have been going through a really difficult issue regarding the memorial of Jesus Christ's death that is upcoming on the 7th of April. Because of the seclusion we are all facing, I have to observe it in my home on my own while watching the actual talks that we normally have over the live internet feed.  But I have to also have the emblems. And I have a major trauma issue involving wine. So it was probably a lot of information that doesn't really have to do too much with this. But anyway, After I talked with my friend, I was feeling a lot calmer and feeling a lot better.   So I thought well, maybe I could eat. But then immediately, my brain said no no, no! If you eat you're just going to have to get rid of it. Meaning laxatives. And then anyway, even if I did eat what in the world would I eat because that is the hardest thing in the world for me to figure out anymore anyway. So it just be easier not to eat in the first place. But it still seemed like maybe I should eat. But then I was afraid that if I did eat then I would feel out of control and eat too much. And then comes the problem yet again that I would have to get rid of it. So it would just be easier not to eat in the first place. Which is what I ended up doing. The crazy thing is, that all of these thoughts went through my head in literally 1 second. I'm so tired of this. It's so totally agonizing and so painful and I'm just sick of it. I want to feel normal, whatever that is. So I didn't even realize how long this would be when I first started, but I haven't really posted much for a while. I've been kind of numb for quite some time. I haven't really been in touch with my feelings or much of anything. I'm just kind of been in complete misery. So thanks anyone for reading all of this.",Savedbygrace ,"Fri,03/27/2020-11:08pm",Read it all,I'm sorry you are going through this.   I'm sorry you are hurting.

682,eringreen14,03/25/2020,Anxiety in Self Isolation- trying to be 'normal' ,"I've been nearly 4 months ED free, after 25 years of living with bulimia. I've had some setbacks, but I've kept going.
I live in Nepal, but have evacuated and am now living in Melbourne with my boyfriend.
I usually live alone!
Living and sharing this space, these meals, all the things- it is wonderful but it is also scary and hard.
I sometimes act irrationally, get irritated, and still think about food and what I'll be eating all the time.
There's a lot to say! Not room enough here. He knows, but we don't talk regularly about my 'condition.'
And I don't want to make that a big focus.
But I need to share my thoughts and anxieties with someone, or I will explode on him, and it's not his fault. He's been wonderful. Anyone else struggling in self-isolation/ quarantine?",cmmesh,"Thu,03/26/2020-9:00pm",yep,"My husband went golfing so I spent the day alone with our dogs. I tried not to turn to food after my meals, had a healthy lunch but after dinner hit some junk food just because it was so weird to be home alone all day. I felt fat most of they year as I'm under a lot of stress from the construction at our house. Our builder isn't very responsible and it's setting me off..i want to restrict my food so I can get control of this remodel but he keeps not following the plans and then making excuses. I am reeling with frustration and my husband doesn't want to talk to the builder so it's all on me. I feel like that just makes the builder less respectful and me more stressed in turn. I did take the dogs to the park and talk to some friends there that cheered me up but I know I'll have to deal with the builder's bs again once the quarantine ends and again it will be just me dealing with him. I feel so weak and powerless to get resepect!
my boss also tends to ignore me off and on and she is in an ignoring phase since we all started to work from home so that's hard. I may get laid off since our business is down but I'm being kept out of the loop.

Hopefully, when things are calmer, maybe you can talk to her about the issue and see what she was trying to say.  Like iwanttolive said, is it possible that she might just be trying to upset you?  It seems like, from some of your earlier posts, that she may have a tendency to bait you.  This is coming from an outsider's perspective, of course, without all of the facts  but it is something you might want to consider, and a real heart-to-heart may be necessary to learn why she does this.

I need more help than virtual sessions. But the psychiatrist said my orthostatics didn't qualify me for residential, however she would be willing to change her recommendation if my doctor was pushing for residential. But my doctor is on leave until next month. So they said to just go home and try to eat more and exercise less.
Feels like my only hope now is to go to my physical next week with my doctors PA and see if I can get into residential. So depressed and discouraged right now.",iwanttolive,"Tue,03/24/2020-7:42pm",MuzikMuse500,"Hi.  I am really sorry you were told that.  I know that IOP and PHP are not operating right now.  The fact that you are being told that your vitals need to be at a certain level makes no sense to me as there is so much more to an eating disorder than vitals.  Or orthostatic's.  I wish they understood this and didn't disqualify people from help for these things as it perpetuates the falsehood about eating disorders and causes people to feel they don't deserve help.  This is not true and you know you need help.  I encourage you to let your doctor know everything going on with you and your thoughts and behaviors as this is what is important and may help the program change their mind as they said.  I am glad you are reaching out for support.  Be encouraged in the Love God has for you and call out to Him for help.  It is a promise of His that He will respond to our cry's.  In the Bible it says God is near to the brokenhearted and those who are faint of heart.  Scared and weary. Right now there is a lot of fear and I am fighting against succumbing to it.   I am listening to the Bible on my TV through an app and there  are  beautiful scenes of the ocean.  Psalm 91 is being read.  If you can, try reading it or google it and read.

688,silverstars,03/24/2020,How To Drown Out My Unhealthy Voice?,"The ""voice"" of my eating disorder is so cruel to me.Well,not all the time.If the number on the scale drops this voice congratulates me.But if i try and go against it and eat a healthy meal it is enraged.i journal this voice sometimes and it is nasty,or lies to me.i do have a healthy voice,but i struggle to hear it over the bellowing eating disorder voice.
i have tried to keep a journal of positive self talk,but it never seems to work.It feels so foreign.
People say i am too hard on myself,but i see it as not quite hard enough.i really don't like myself so it is easy to listen to the negative voice,which is pleased when i put myself down,and then i can be easily convinced of not taking care of myself.Sorry.Maybe this makes no sense at all.And some might say that it is not a good idea to think of my eating disorder as a seperate entity.But that describes it for me.Anyway,i am at a loss as to how to encourage my healthy voice to take over and drown out my negative voice.
Maybe when i stop with all this self loathing?
And just how do i do that?i know i will never recover unless that voice is completely obliterated.
But??
How do i do that?Sorry if this is all over the place and nonsensical.
Maybe i will regret posting this.ACK!!!",AndiTutti,"Tue,03/24/2020-4:53pm",You make perfect sense :),"First of all: you make perfect sense. I also view my ED voice as a separate entity-- my Dr told me to think of it as a parasite. And I'm glad you have a healthy voice even if it feels weak right now.
As for how to obliterate the ED voice-- I don't have an answer. I am still early on in recovery but I just had my first appointment with a therapist and I think that will help eventually.  Anyway, know you are not alone, you are not crazy, and I wish you the best in your recovery.  :)",silverstars,"Wed,03/25/2020-7:15am",Thank you,"Thank you so much for the validation,AndiTutti.Yes,a parasite is a good way to look at it.

The messages I always received from the people in my life, are really what fuels the voice of my eating disorder. I don't know if anything might be similar for you. Maybe you can explore that with your therapist or doctor.

689,disordered_sprout,03/18/2020,In a bad place right now....,"I'm sixteen years old and have had my current eating disorder since I was thirteen (I think). My parents know about it already, and I've been meeting with a nutritionist since June, after I had a really bad bout. And for a while, it seemed like I was doing okay. I was still weird about food, but at least I was eating more. And around January, I started to get really depressed, and I started restricting again to cope. My nutritionist could tell I'd lost weight at my last appointment, and now I'm scared. I don't want my parents to know about this, because during my last relapse, they were no help at all. My mom seems to think I do it just to piss her off. I've stopped meeting with my therapist because we can't afford it. The timing couldn't be worse because 1) I'm stuck with my parents because of coronavirus quarantine, 2) this current relapse, and 3) I'm at a point in my life where what I do matters. I just feel..... really stuck. Please help.",alwaysthinking,"Thu,03/19/2020-10:35pm",Assertiveness,"Have you ever tried assertiveness therapy? Or have you ever learned about being assertive? It's when you use ""I"" statements.  Basically, you would have conversations with your parents and tell them how you're feeling about things by always making sure that you start a sentence  with the word I. So if you're having problems with your mother saying that something to the extent of you're only doing this to tick me off. Then you might be able to respond something in the way of saying I feel very hurt when you say things like that. And then maybe you might be able to respond
by helping her understand why you are dealing with this.  Do you understand? Do you know what triggers your eating disorder? Did you ever get a chance to work with that when you did work with a therapist before? At any rate, It's something to explore. And definitely something to try to explain to your mother. And always try to use an assertive way to tell her these things, because when we make statements that start with Anything such as you always.... It sounds very accusatory and immediately puts the other person on edge  and on the defensive. But if we very patiently talk about how we personally feel when something happens that the other person does, It usually takes the sting off of things better. Now a word to the wise, this doesn't work with everybody. But hopefully your mother is doing this in a loving way and is just concerned for you. And if she is willing to listen to you, she'll also be willing to listen to you if you talk to her assertively.  But also make sure you do it  at an appropriate time. For instance, if she's really worked up about something, wait until a Time that she might be able to be more relaxed.  I hope these are some good suggestions. And I hope that you are able to get the help that you need, especially once all of us is over.

I see absolutely obviously starved and skinny women  running away every ounce of extra flesh with such intensity and with very unhappy faces. I have to simply eat less volume of the pretty healthful and tasty food I do. And, generally staying as active as well but with movement I enjoy. To take care of myself in this way is exhausting and lonely since so few ""get it"" except my fellow food addicts. I must live with my actions and this addiction which I never chose, and its' terrifying weight gaining consequences if I don't take my affiction one moment, 1 hour, 1 day at a time.

He sees everything as black and white and logic and says he wants to help but I feel like he is hindering and making any attempts I make at recovery worse.

I make all my own food despite me crying out to my husband to just do it for me because I cant make those choices and its driving me crazy. I am convinced he prefers me to be anorexic.

I am sooooo confused and he is trying to rationalise everything but there is nothing rational about this and I just dont know whst’s what! I feel like my head is such a mess. I have 2 teenagers who I am trying to hide it all from and I have no time to fix myself. I cant think straight. I cant concentrate on anything. Writing this is a struggle. I have no time or energy to sort myself out and I dont know whats right and wrong in my thinking. I cant get help so I have to do this alone.

I'm not going to put a number because I know that could be triggering to others. I put it into my old calorie app-- which I know I shouldn't it was triggering to me m:( Anyway, it actually was a lot-- it's not just my skewed perception of food.
I eat when I'm hungry and sometimes I eat things simply because it sounds tasty or I want to or sometimes I feel a strong ""mental hunger"" (if that makes sense?). I'm doing 3 meals and 2-3 snacks, so I guess it makes sense that it's so much but I'm afraid once I'm weight restored I won't be able to stop.

I’ve always had some unhealthy tendencies around food but about a year ago things got really bad. I have been battling OCD for a while now and anorexia kind of took the wheel as I was making it through the OCD. I’ve been struggling more and more everyday and finding a loss of hope. My therapist has been bringing up hospitalization a lot and I’m really scared of how far this will all go for me. When I was diagnosed with OCD I found an app for support and eventually connect with a few members through Instagram. The people I met on that app and made an instagram group chat with helped me recover in ways I can’t even begin to describe... they quite honestly saved my life. I have been very lonely with the eating disorder and am so glad to have found this community. Having people to relate to and support was a huge positive for my OCD recovery and I’m hoping to find similar support for the ED.,alwaysthinking,"Mon,03/23/2020-10:08am",Welcome,"Hi, just wanted welcome you  to The Forum.

696,Lifetlks,03/14/2020,Exercise and Food Obsession,"Hi,
I'm not sure really how to start this or what to say, perhaps some context will help. I've been sporty my whole life, since I was 9 I've been in competitive sports and stayed in them till I was 18 when I started getting injured and sick. I'm now 20 and I am really struggling with maintaining a consistent exercise schedule and eating plan.
I try to make up and stick to a consistent training schedule and then end up burning out in less than a week or I'm too sore and tired to do anything. I then fall into a cycle of depression, guilt, and anger because I can't complete a training schedule that I keep on drastically reducing.
Since I havent been able to properly train Ive fallen into a cycle of feeling guilty when I am eating, I then tend to restrict my food and then get so hungry and eat way too much at one time. Its always healthy food and I havent been able to enjoy other foods I have enjoyed before such as 'junk' food in general.
Ive found that Im always trying to maintain exercise in consistency with the national health guidelines however I tend to go too overboard and push myself too hard and not listen to my body.
Currently I am all over the place lately emotionally, my period has been AWOL for 6 months now, my appetite is all over the place, Im underweight for my height and even my parents say I look anorexic in a marathon runner sort of way.
I feel overwhelmed because I want to exercise but exercise and therefore a food obsession has seemed to take over my life and I just dont know what to do.

I lost my puppy fat from HS where most gain The Freshman 15+. While on Christmas Vacation I finished all my PE classes w/ A's. I was too nervous during my break w/ school to eat solid food. I obsessed over a liquid meal plan and lost weight. When i returned to school i was obsessing more over what solid foods were ok for me to eat i did not wish to re-gain any weight lost during school break. My gymnastic coach noticed my loss and embarrassed me in bringing it up. My swim coach made me talk b4 stepping up the ladder, i suppose to make me breath before pulling out of the pool. So college freshman yr went on. I slowly took less PE classes and was more involved in getting higher grades. I enjoyed college and meeting all kinds of new friends too. I went back on solid foods and gained some weight but stopped w/ the exercise obsession. I worked during college too so that kept my schedule chuck full of things to do and hrs to be at work. I transferred to 4 yr university and graduated w/in 2 yrs.It was hard to find a great paying job after college and that was another trauma in itself.....The cycle started over again and realized that stress and expectations on myself to succeed were also mental triggers for my ED behaviors too.Found a counselor, female-intern, but older and experienced in life, kinda the older sister-cousin that i never had...?She hooked me up w/ a shrink, they teamed up on me and sort of made me feel controlled by those 2 working together like mom n dad had never done in parenting me?I found a nice job involved in social services and was ok except that my BF was putting External Expectations on me......",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've struggled with my weight for as long as I can remember. Sometimes I'm in denial and think that my body and weight don't matter and I eat whatever and whenever I want. Other times I watch carefully, restrict and eat healthy during my ""window.""  I'll start to have success, but once it slows down or I hit a plateau, or I don't feel well, or go on vacation, or get caught up in the depressing news of the day, etc, I'm back to my old ways.  I feed the inner voice that has me standing at the pantry, making horrible choices, once everyone has gone to bed. This happens at least once a month.  Sometimes to the point of purging. (maybe 2x a year)I listened to a webinar the other day and thought I found ""the answer.""  A woman was talking about how to retrain your brain from the pattern of emotional eating.  She invited those listening to attend a free phone consultation.  She spoke with me for over an hour. She spoke kindly  and supportively and wanted to learn about my history with emotional eating and take me on as a ""client.""  The 12 week program sounded great until I learned the discount price was 5K! I declined. I feel really down today.  I'm not sure where to turn.

705,AndiTutti,03/17/2020,Too good at pretending,Lately I've felt like I am drowning and I'm tired of fighting my own mind. But I am far too good at pretending to be fine so I don't have to think or talk about it. That combined with not being good at asking for help means I feel stuck. I just had an virtual appointment with my nutritionist but I did not bring up any of my concerns. I just did not know how or even how to put into words what I'm thinking and feeling. My head is too loud I guess but that is so vague and I don't think people without EDs or other mental illnesses could understand. And some of the thoughts I have been having would sound so dumb and irrational outloud. I am a perfectionist in a sense and I don't want people I care about to judge me for these thoughts. I know they probably wouldn't but I have a paralyzing fear of it. All that to say I just feel stuck. How do others ask for help even when it's hard?,alwaysthinking,"Tue,03/17/2020-9:46pm",Brain,"I totally get it because I hate my Brain.  I don't know if you have read any of my past posts about the Body talks that my eating disorder therapist originally assigned me to do,  But by doing them, I discovered that I absolutely hate Brain.  I have finally decided I like the rest of my body parts because they have pretty cool personalities. But Brain, she is a deceptive, manipulative witch, to say the least. And yeah, asking for help is very difficult, especially when you don't know  Who is safe to ask. It becomes really hard, also, when you have asked people in the past for help, and you end up getting hurt by them. So as far as giving suggestions for asking for help, I would say, go with people that have been trustworthy in the past and also have been willing to give it. Just today, I went out on a limb, and I decided to put myself out there and ask my cousin  for emotional support. Big mistake. She means well, but she is not the emotional type. It went very poorly. So, when asking for help, definitely find the people that have been helpful and eager to help you in the past. I hope all that makes sense. But as far as trusting your brain, and worrying that the thoughts in it sound irrational to others, that's another story entirely especially when you have mental disorders. But somehow, I have a feeling that this is really something that most of the world struggles with. It's kind of like something I told someone that came out of my therapist's office one time - I heard him telling the office worker that Deb makes him feel normal. And I told him that I have Deb also. But then I proceeded to say, we are the normal ones; it's the rest of the world that's not normal. :)  I hope this gives you some encouragement.",AndiTutti,"Wed,03/18/2020-9:43am",Thank you,"Thank you, it does.

I see my doctor and I have a nutritionist, but it's been extremely hard to find a therapist. Hopefully I'll have one soon and hopefully that will help. For now, I just have to wait. Also, being stuck at home due to virus outbreak means I have nothing to occupy my mind but my (not at all nice) thoughts.

Are there people in your life who you know care and who can in a way serve as your motivation to seek help until you find that motivation for yourself?

707,alwaysthinking,03/17/2020,Day Four....I ate!!,"But it definitely didn't start out looking like I would. I was still having a miserable day and even when I went to my trauma therapist, I wasn't thinking I would end up eating at all, if ever again. When I left his appointment, he did ask me if I would try to be able to eat something. And that landed me right into a flashback. So that wasn't very helpful, obviously. Not his fault. When I got back in town, I received an email  from one of my close friends that she was out of some staples food wise. She wasn't asking me for any, but she was just informing me that the situation around the entire city was like this.  I had earlier emailed her and asked her if she needed any help because she no longer had her health aides helping her due to the virus, of course. I also had to tell her, though, that I probably wouldn't be of much use because of the anorexia kicking in so badly right now. But when I got home and saw that she was low on a lot of food staples that I had, I knew that I had some of those items that I could spare. I knew that even if I did  begin eating again, I still could spare the amount that I was giving her. She is a shut-in basically now, because of being high risk.  She is also in a wheelchair, So I wanted to be able to help her as much as I could. I was thrilled that I was able to do this for her, and when I was home, I actually had  a little bit of an inkling to be able to eat. And then I read the return message from my cousin. I had texted her earlier in the day trying to let her know how I had been feeling recently and basically putting myself out there, emotionally. I was hoping I would get empathy. I was hoping that she might actually be able to help me in this regards with other people as well. I should have known better. She really is a sweet person and I love her to pieces. She also is not an empath in any way shape or form. Sometimes I'm not sure if she's really in touch with her feelings. I've only seen her cry one time. So I don't think she really knows how to express her feelings nor does she know how to help others when they are expressing their feelings. She quite often does not validate my feelings when I express them. To the contrary, She usually completely dismisses them and ends up defending other people and making excuses for them instead. So after reading her text message reply, my teeny weeny little desire to eat completely went out the window. And I was back to feeling yet again that nobody cares about me, at least within my circle of friends around here. And I was back to feeling like I simply do not matter, so why bother anymore? And even though I am trying like crazy to stay alive, I was also half feeling like if this anorexia kills me, there's only two people around here that I think would even care. But I also was tired of feeling like I have no control over anything and that I was allowing other people's  misguided judgments and ignorance to destroy my life. Especially when all I want to be doing is teaching people about Jehovah God and helping people. So I decided to take my trauma therapist's advice, and I did another body talk.  This time, what I did was have all of my body parts (except for Brain, of course, becuse all of the body parts and I included agree that we cannot stand her), have an in-depth discussion as to what needed to be done in order to help me be able to eat again. And at the end, I got involved in the conversation too.  And the end result, was that  I finally decided it really does not matter how anybody treats me or whether or not they ignore me or anything. What matters is knowing how much Jehovah God loves me, and knowing what type of person I know that I am.  I know what's in my heart. I know WHO I am.  If other people choose not to learn that part of me because of social stigmas, that's their loss.  If they choose not to follow Bible principles, again, that's on them, not me.  I will still treat everybody the same way, with love, and that's all that matters.   That doesn't mean it's not going to hurt from time to time. Because it does, obviously.  I've always been the type of person who just can't understand that if I love somebody why they don't love me also. But, I can work on that. And maybe they'll come around and start seeing me for who I really am.  All I have to worry about really, is how Jehovah God views me. I do want to thank all of you though, for being here for me and caring about me and showing me that you care about me. And oh, the most important part of course,  is that after I did do the body talk,  I ate a very late supper and then I ate my bedtime snack. I'm absolutely stuffed, since it's been three and a half days since I've eaten anything.   And prior to that the other days were very skimpy with my meals as well. So it's probably going to take a while before my body gets used to having real meals again.   But, I'll get through it. And tomorrow starts another day.",MuzikMuse500,"Wed,03/18/2020-12:18am",I've been very worried for,"I've been very worried for you and have been praying and I'm so glad that you found the courage to eat.

710,Sarahwainwri,03-11-20,I’m Scared,"My eating disorder was triggered recently, for the first time since high school. I’m scared to talk about it with my therapist because in the past this discussion has turned into a trip to the ER to check my vitals. I know I need help, but I can’t afford that kind of treatment. It also does not help that I suffer from Imposter Syndrome regarding my ED, thanks to high school friends responding to my cries for help by accusing me of lying about it.I’ve tried so many at home treatments to rewire my brain, but no matter what I’m still finding myself subconsciously skipping meals and restricting the portions of what I do eat. I just don’t know what else I can reasonably do for myself, and I know that if I end up having to go to the hospital in any capacity, whether it’s for outpatient testing or inpatient treatment, the cost will weigh on me for years and just cause more issues for my mental health. I’m curious to know if anyone has experience treating their ED without having to pay for expensive treatments. Like I said, I recognize that I need it but the cheap insurance plan I have barely covers anything.",MuzikMuse500,"Wed,03/11/2020-12:41pm",I'm sorry you're in this,"I'm sorry you're in this difficult place. It's stupid that insurance won't cover life-saving treatment just because it's an eating disorder. My insurance is refusing to cover inpatient treatment, even though that's what my doctor is recommending. It is difficult but not impossible to recover from an eating disorder without treatment. One thing that is important is getting a nutritionist. Also having a support team to make sure that you follow your meal plan, I used to send photos of each meal to my boyfriend but now I married him and so he can sit and watch me eat the meals in person :-). The biggest concern about recovering on your own is refeeding syndrome, where your electrolytes get out of balance. It's important to see a doctor regularly for blood work to monitor that. Bottom line is, either way you need to build a strong Support Network if you are going to be successful in recovery. Do you have a therapist currently? Or friends and family who know and care and can support you? One other thing, what about financial assistance? I got financial aid the first time I went to treatment and it covered 100% of all costs.

Secondly, you deserve help. No matter how long you've dealt with this (I had only been struggling for about 2 years before I recently sought help). I felt similarly-- ""some people have had this for years, I'm not bad enough yet to get help"" but it doesn't matter how long or how bad or whatever.
Lastly, you'll never be ""ready"". You sound like you are as close as you can get though. Please, reach out to someone you trust, reach out to your doctor, build yourself a support system because you are right-- you can't do this alone.

716,CASACERA,03-03-20,starting from scratch,"What's that old saying? ""If we don't learn from history, we're bound to repeat it""? Funny how that should apply here, to me with my insidious, powerful and baffling overeating disorder. Hardest battle of all is to stop eating food I love once started. I planned a snack last night but I kept noticing I was watching the clock, even though busy, my addiction kept gnawing. So enveloping. Even though it's food, the way other serious addictions are described, I'm right there with them. And so eating my planned snack at 9 instead of 11-11:30, right when I'm ready to pop into bed was bound to be a set-up. And then? The perverbable wild horse was out of the gate, first this, then that, queen of the nibbler's looking for the final moment of satiation. My BIG CHALLENGE TONIGHT IS NO MATTER WHAT TRY TO EAT NOTHING BETWEEN DINNER AND BEDTIME SNACK. Can you believe this?
When people who know me see me they can't believe this is what I go through. If you're healthy and normal looking ""OH, CC you don't have a problem, why do you struggle with this?"" But I know the potential of how easy it is to gain weight and pull away from a healthful, joyful life. Folks who suffer with this, get it.

I have been diagnosed by respected medical professionals as suffering from a eating food addiction disorder. Led me to two totally insurance paid for hospital stints. If I never had to eat again like other addicts do with their addictions, ""recovery"" would happen. But imagine if the addicts with recognized addictions had to still ""do it"" 3 or more times a day what would their recoveries look like? But there's absolutely nothing wrong with managing my disorder, having experienced that from time to time. Name so many serious physical afflictions and with medical treatment manage their disorders and go on with their lives. This has been one of my exhausting all-I-can-do but un-managing times. That's why in desperation I found this NEDA site. So it's the old ""one day at a time"" and the Serenity Prayer that I do and must continue on doing whatever I can to help myself. Thanks all!

There was rationing and some things just weren't available at all. But the fed. govt was so on top of it. Food rationing was so fair, no gas for cars, in fact no new cars were being made at all. We saved all paper and everything metal and packed it neatly out front of our house to be picked up. We had victory gardens, every family had people serving or involved in the common goal. I still remember all the patriotic songs we all sang and still have some leftover war effort stamps. Cashed in my bonds later on. But the whole country worked incredibly well together without
complaining. Won't go into the food substitutes here, but there were many and not appetising at all. It's just that this is so different. Everyone scrambling for themselves.

And yeah, I know I would never care one fig about what anybody else looks like, Nor would I care what anybody else's shape is. I never have.  I don't judge people by that way. I'm not really judging myself that way either. I just don't like how I look. I like how I looked when I was thinner. To an extent at least.  I know, of course, I'll never be truly satisfied with Any  weight, size, shape, etcetera. But why do I have to settle with the one that I have now?

721,vjdx91,03-11-20,PLEASE READ-I truly need advice.,"Hello everyone. I really need some advice and possibly another viewpoint of what I'm experiencing. I will begin by saying I grew up having a mom that had anorexia/bulimia. I truly developed my eating disorder in 2010 when I deliberately began starving myself and making it a goal to get thin. I went from X to X lbs. As I progressed through college I was so fixated on my weight. 10 years later (and currently) I am 28 and approx. X lbs. I have gained weight through the years and I do believe a lot has to do with my age; however, I think I've shifted from starving to binging. I have such a problem with binging and doing it randomly at night. It's so frustrating because I eat great during the day. I keep getting random urges to not eat during the day because I want to go back to that control. I don't know what to do.",MuzikMuse500,"Thu,03/12/2020-11:10am","Thank you for sharing, I'm","Thank you for sharing, I'm sorry that you're hurting so much. Eating Disorders suck. Truly. I grew up with an anorexic mother, anorexic brother, and a father with binge eating disorder. I used to go from starving to binging as well. It's a very difficult struggle and I truly understand. The best advice I can give is to go see a nutritionist and a doctor. I can't emphasize enough how helpful it is to have a meal plan to follow. Sticking to it and having people help you to do that can really help with the urges to binge as well. Binging is nothing to feel guilty about, it is a normal response to starvation. If you go too long without eating and then you decide to eat a bunch, it's hard to stop because your body thinks it's in a famine and so it thinks it needs to eat as much as possible while food is available. Pretty much anyone in the same circumstance would also binge. It doesn't mean you lack self-control now. So yeah, You are not alone and you deserve help. My heart goes out to you and I hope that my comment helps in some way. Keep posting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
722,lifeisjustachac...,03-10-20,I Don't Know If I Have An ED,"I didn't really know what topic to put this under, but basically, I think I might have an ED and a lot of people are saying I do, but I just don't know if I classify as one. I have really bad anxiety, and when I get stressed out, I find it hard to eat, and last year is when it all started to develop. I had anxiety so bad that I started only eating a full meal like every two or three days or so, and feeling physically unable to eat. I didn't think much of it, because I didn't ever feel hungry or anything, and it was really easy to lie to my parents and friends about eating a late lunch or eating at a friend's house or something, so it worked pretty well for me. however, I started to lose a lot of weight, and my friends started to notice. At that point in time, I was X and by the end of winter, when my anxiety started to calm down, I was at X pounds and my BMI was kinda messed up. once summer started though, I could eat like normal and everything is fine. the only thing that was different, was that my friends know knew that I had trouble eating, but they knew it wasn't an ED and that it was just my anxiety. This year though, it been a little different. I've been eating even less, and for reasons unknown to me, I downloaded a calorie tracker app, which originally started out as a way to make sure I was eating enough, but I don't think it's just that anymore. I'm X now, and last week I weighed X pounds which is pretty good for me, but its been going down so much, that I weighed myself and now I'm at X. I know I'm not as rapidly declining as a lot of people, but it still scares me a lot, especially when some days I only get like X calories in me, and I haven't had more than X in a day in three weeks. I was actually body-shamed last year, which I didn't think affected me, but I've been thinking about it more and more with my anxiety getting worse again, and I think it might actually have impacted me. sometimes I find myself just wishing that I was pretty, or stereotypically pretty, because especially for a female, I really have no shape to my body because of my bone structure, and ill probably never have the waist that I so desperately crave. I think I've been too scared to confront the fact that the reason my eating is so much worse this year is because of my body image up until this point, but one of my exes with an ED has been trying to get me to think about it and some of my friends have as well. I just don't know what to do. I'm getting really scared, because now whenever I try to get, I get super nauseous and think I'm going to vomit, and I get bad headaches as well. the other day, I hadn't eaten for a long time, and I actually passed out while I was getting ready for work and woke up fifteen minutes later on my bedroom floor. not to mention that me not eating, paired with the fact I only get two hours of sleep a night and have a job at a restaurant that I work at for 7 hours at a time as well as school, I don't know if I can function if I keep passing out, but I don't know how to stop eating. also, I really like the way I'm losing weight but I still don't know if that's why I'm not eating. I don't know. I think I just need to have someone tell me what my brain is doing.",alwaysthinking,"Tue,03/10/2020-9:29pm",Get help,"Yes, it sounds like you need to find someone who is qualified to help you, either an e.d. therapist, or a nutritionist, or at least someone who can give you a reality check to tell you what your behaviors are doing to your body (like a medical doctor).

I’ve had moments in my life throughout where it’s gotten bad after gaining a whole bunch of weight and then losing a lot over a couple months from primarily purging behaviors. One of these bad times is right now- people are worried and those who knows are concerned. If I’m not binging and purging, I restrict or use substances to help me restrict. I keep tally of how many times I purge to see patterns and it’s been quite a bit. I stopped getting my period last month, my hair falls out more in the shower, I have absolutely no energy physically or mentally, mood swings, have had my parotid an salivary glands become inflamed and swollen, broken blood vessels and I’m sure some unseen issues which scare me. I’ve been in and out of therapy for years and recently started again. I just don’t know where to start or how to stop this. It’s completely taken over so many aspects of my life and I’m high functioning in terms of maintaining a job and social life but it’s been getting SO hard to get to work everyday. I just don’t have it in me anymore to keep fighting this and I’m scared it’ll damage me physically long term or that I’ll never truly recover. A couple friends suggested thinking about inpatient and I’m not sure how I feel but think at this point it’s one of those few or only things that could help me.

I am so sorry you are feeling this way. But I am glad you are here and seeking advice on what would help you.
When I was debating on weather or not I should go to treatment, it basically came down to the fact of if I would be able to continue recovery outpatient. And the answer was no, I could not do it outpatient. I had been trying for 6 years, and I could not make any progress beyond a certain point. I did not want to go, but I realised that I was not going to get any better other wise.
If you think you can buckle down and continue with outpatient, great! But there is no shame in needing more support. I do not want to tell you what you should do, because that is your decision.
If you are looking for a trwatment center, NEDA has some great resources. The helpline also help you.

733,alwaysthinking,03-08-20,Totally Defective - I can't escape my past,"I'm so unbelievably depressed right now, and I honestly don't know how it's ever truly going to change.  Sure, I have my few moments when I feel decent, and a few times when I feel super, but invariably, it always returns to this same feeling of infinite dread, because nothing I do is ever going to change my past.  I have told my trauma therapist that the flashbacks don't bother me as much, any more, because they're over; in the past; done.  And it's true.  They don't bother me very much at all, now.  What does, however, is realizing that I am a total social moron, who simply cannot ever be ""normal,"" because my parents basically prevented me from ever having any relationship with absolutely anyone, at all, my entire life!  I was their world, essentially.  Or, to put it more accurately, my world was them.  Sure, I was involved in tons of extracurricular activities when in school, but actual relationships, whether with schoolmates or even within my religious organization was basically forbidden.  Even once I was an adult, I still lived with my parents till I was 41, and under their domineering thumbs, I was only to be their friend and do what they wanted, never what I may have desired.  So, being completely brainwashed for 41 years out of my almost 44, now, how am I ever supposed to have a chance of changing the way I was manipulated into thinking for so long?  It formed my brain.  My totally whacked-out Brain that I absolutely can't stand.  How do I have a chance at ever having ""normal"" relationships?  Why bother trying?  I feel totally defeated and utterly hopeless.  I know Jehovah God can and will change all that, when His Son, Jesus Christ begins ruling on earth, after Armageddon.  I know that Paradise will fix all of this.

It is not your fault.  Your brain is tricking you by telling you you're not sick enough.  Any eating disorder is dangerous and deadly. It's completely normal to feel that way.  I've been there too.  I don't regret getting treatment.   I would encourage you to go if others are expressing you need this
  Often times,  we can't really see how bad we are, and sometimes it takes the intervention from others to help take those first steps.  I know the unknown is really scary, but it's less scary than the inevitable of not getting help: death.  And you have to ask yourself how h as ppy you really are st this point.  Recovery is possible and SO worth it in the end.  After 29 years, and relapsing over the past 3 years, I am SO much better.

It's a good reminder that I'm not alone in this and it's normal to relapse and to struggle. I made an appointment for an evaluation at an eating disorder clinic later this month.

And I just want to tell you, again, as the above posters have said, You have a mental disorder. It really is no different than having a physical illness, And I'm sure none of us would feel that we are being sinful if we had cancer or diabetes or any other physical problem. It's just the stigma of what Society puts on mental illnesses that makes us worry that when we  relapse with any mental illness, that means that we are giving in and sinning or some other wacko thing, so to speak. So I hear you and I feel for you. And I just want to say, You are not sinning. God cares for you and He feels for you.  He loves you. He knows how much you are struggling. He wants you to get better and He will help you get through this. Hang in there. I'm here for you.

Having to deal with an eating disorder is many times completely out of our control and not something we’d intentionally do. It doesn’t make us bad, it makes us human and we have something that needs helping. I’ve felt very similarly lately in terms of some friends suggesting possibility of inpatient but I feel I’m not “sick” enough- especially dealing with bulimia where most people who are bulimic aren’t underweight. I’m scared of a professional telling me I’m not sick enough which I feel in my mind would translate to not thin enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

738,AndiTutti,03-04-20,Coping Skills?,"Hello!
I was wondering if anyone had suggestions for coping skills to replace  using disordered behaviors? Ever since I started recovery I have been feeling emotions very intensely-- which is great when it's happiness/joy/excitement! But it's tougher to sit with the sadness/anxiety/stress/guilty/other negative emotions. What do you do when you are feeling down to process your emotions or distract yourself or make yourself feel better?",CP1218,"Wed,03/04/2020-9:48pm","I’m still working on this too, but","A golden nugget of advice a psychiatrist gave me is this: If you change your thoughts, it changes your emotions, which changes your behavior. When I start to get bad thoughts, I try to stop and think them through and try to favor logic/realism over untamed emotion. For example, ask yourself things like what’s the problem, what’s causing this emotional reaction, what should I do about it, etc. It’s really a situational thing, and sometimes I struggle to force myself to do this too, but it helps. Writing out my thoughts also helps me organize and better understand how I feel. Have you considered keeping a journal?",alwaysthinking,"Thu,03/05/2020-6:37am",Distract,"I just posted a whole list of distracting techniques on the post ""is this ok?"" Basically, anything you use as hobbies.  But when you feel really depressed, sometimes even those don't ""cut it.""  Do you pray?  That always helps me.  Also talking to friends can be helpful.   Journaling, as the above poster mentioned.  Sometimes, just separating myself from the situation physically, like going for a walk in nature (too cold, recently, of course) or going for a drive helps me to process my thoughts better.  And sometimes, just having a really good cry and letting it all out can be quite cathartic,  as well.  Just some ideas.  I hope it helps and gives you some, also.",AndiTutti,"Thu,03/05/2020-5:42pm",Great suggestions!,"Thank you both for responding, those are all great suggestions! Some of them I already do-- a good cry is definitely one of them but I had been getting sick of crying lately. I also enjoy walks and today was nicer weather where I am. :)
I think I'm going to dig around and see if I happen to have a journal lying around or else I should go buy one because I liked that suggestion. Thank you again!",HeroCat,"Fri,03/06/2020-10:03am",another idea,"I like journaling, but sometimes it seems like to organized an undertaking. I also have something called a ""smash"" book-- it's much more free form and in that I allow myself to cut out things from magazines, glue in pictures, sketch, and be more ""messy"" than in my journal. Come to think of it-- I haven't used it in ages and I should dig it out. I think it might be more helpful sometimes in dealing with bigger emotions before I am ready to actually do productive writing about them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had no energy, I was cold all the time, my heart rate dropped and I got scared about the consequences. Since I started eating more I already have started to feel so much better but I think my next step is to tell my therapist. Except every week I put it off because I’m scared about what she will say. I don’t know what recovery looks like for someone with atypical anorexia, I’m not underweight nor have I ever been underweight I’m at a healthy weight for my age,height,etc. and I’m very scared she will tell me I have to gain weight to make a full recovery and I don’t know if I’m ready for that.

Maybe just posting this and actually admitting to someone else, even through a screen that I’ve been suffering will help me realize that what I’m going through is valid and will help me tell my therapist.

Fighting an eating disorder is so challenging, you are so incredibly Brave to want to get better and to already be trying. I'm glad you realized what this disorder is taking from you. I would definitely encourage seeing a therapist and also a doctor. Eating Disorders thrive on secrecy. It's important to have a support team to monitor your condition. Also get in to see the doctor soon if you can, something called refeeding syndrome can happen. Even if you're eating more and restoring weight, your metabolism might kick into overdrive and this can result in an electrolyte imbalance that can kill you, this is why it's important to have a medical professional monitor your condition as you recover. Also maybe look into a nutritionist? A meal plan can be very helpful. Keep posting and keep us updated!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MANAGING my form of BED is. Eating food, the whole gestalt, the experience of it all AND in the absence of being involved in any of my passions (music, art, writing or engaging with others, OR even a physical pleasure like riding my 3 speed Raleigh Sports bike or taking a shower (love showers) MY LOST IN THE EATING FOOD EXPERIENCE TAKES OVER IN AN INSTANT. Sorry for all the run-on sentences.
So essential for me to write about this, for my particular journey and my best health and comfort (physically and emotionally), since I still have to eat and my subconscious brain doesn't forget its magic, I have to work with what I am and do realistically. I don't see it differently from treating high blood pressure or cholesterol etc. My very best treatment is what I'm doing here, right now, getting it out and hoping that helps others connect in any way with their own road to satisfaction and peace.
