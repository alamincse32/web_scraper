I have been a member it says for 1 month and 4 weeks. I realized I have an eating disorder caused by stress and living in a toxic environment. here's a bit of my back story since this is the only place I feel safe.as a kid my cousins used to touch me and make it out to be a game for me but in reality for them they were being curious and imitating what they knew adults did but on me. they were much older than I was I just thought they finally wanted to hang out with little ol me. it came to the point where I started listening to my body. my body was trying to tell me to be scared this isn't normal. I would pee myself purposely in the morning so that they'd find me gross again and not want to touch me. it worked. but then my grandmother would consistently yell at me telling me im too old to be doing that instead of asking why was I doing it.here I am 23 years old with my own daughter now. anytime I look at her I get flashbacks about the things I faced. I know its not her fault but it haunts me. I now have people asking me how I lost weight so fast or wow Im used to you being thick or hey your losing weight. why dont people realize that these things puts us in a deeper hole. I know I shouldn't let their words get to me but it does and it hurts and I feel like im never getting out of this alive.I feel like im drowning and everyone is just watching me sink to the bottom throwing me short pieces of rope to ""help"" but is it really helping? or is it just to make them feel better about themselves?im having gallbladder issues because the drastic weight drop and prior to this I spoke to my dr about having an eating disorder and needing to take steps Into recovery. so we started me with therapy. now she's telling me its my fault that im going through these gallbladder issues because I lost too much weight as if I told her this is what I wanted to do. I never wanted to lose weight I've been depressed and alone without really being alone cause I have my man aka my daughters father but he's always at work so again alone.I also get these awful pains in my knees ankles back just all round body aches and pains. is that normal? has anyone else felt this way? I feel like a zombie at times. I also get hungry pains but no motivation to get up and eat something as I should.I have no friends because any friend I get they just start issues so that the friendship can end and then im the bad guy. I had a friend who sabotaged our living space knowing I have a child and I can't work cause im a stay at home mom and still to this day won't take accountability for it. she tried making it my fault and then bring things up that didnt have to do with the current situation.I feel like im better off forgotten.but that's not what I want. I want to love myself again. I want to feel like someone again. I just want my life back.",recoveryj,"Sun,10/17/2021-11:00am","I’m so sorry you’re facing so much hardship right now. It sounds so lonely and terrifying. Know that you are not alone. And you are deserving of support, love, and care. Have you tried searching for someone who specializes in eating disorders? It sounds like your current doctor is extremely dismissive and is not listening to you at all. It would be really helpful to find a doctor who is familiar with eating disorders to help you better meet your needs. Another idea is to get in touch with a dietician who specializes in eating disorders. They can help you come up with a meal plan that meets your needs and helps you truly get your life back. You deserve to heal. You deserve recovery.

I am still not working out and the simple fact of cleaning my apartment leaves me feeling very tired. Yesterday, my dietician told me I can start doing some light exercise (30 mins) to see how it goes.
Of course, I can not start with it until I talk to my cardiologyst and therapist.
It is weird. Although I still feel the desire to exercise (ED-mandated), I also feel pretty glad without doing anything.I have not been coming too much to the forums because I have been super swamped at work. Also, I am quite low of energy.But I do not forget you ladies. I always keep you in my mind and heart.I hope you are doing well.How is the teaching going?Regards

2,10/11/2021,verystrongurgetorelapse,lulu601,"hi everyone - i’m here again,from the last time i spoke about wanting to relapse those urges still haven’t gone away and they’re becoming stronger and stronger. about a week ago i even weighed myself for the first time in months and i brought out my fitbit - i was planning on relapsing again. but i have exams and i know that if i relapse i will not be able to study for them and they see extremely important exams. i even made an account dedicated to my ed on twt hoping i’d keep myself accountable but i can’t go back to it. i know what i’m doing is bad and i know how harmful my ed is for me but i really miss the addicting feeling of fasting and the high i’d get after not eating for a day. i miss the feeling of an empty stomach and i miss being weak and tired all the time. as stupid as it sounds i miss my ed and i really want to relapse. but at the same time i can’t just because i’m so far into recovery i don’t think i’ll be able to restrict like how i used to 2 years ago. yes i’ve been in recovery for nearly 2 years now and i suddenly want to relapse.truth be told i just simply cannot stand this body - it’s not unfamiliar because i’ve been this weight for months but i’ll never be able to get used to it. i feel so ashamed about it. i’m so incredibly insecure about it - i can’t even explain the way i feel about my body. i feel like i don’t deserve to recover i feel like i don’t deserve to eat. i want to punish myself and starve myself again but i don’t want to go back to my ed hell. because the binges were horrid - the hair loss was terrifying. i was always on the verge of crying because of how sensitive i was. although i know all of this i still want to go back to it i’m literally sayinf opposite things i feel pathetic.i don’t recognise myself. i’m a lot - and i’m not exaggerating serious a lot higher than my pre ed weight. i used to reassure myself that the overshoot would go away and i’d go back to my pre ed weight but i know it’s a lie. i keep deluding myself into thinking i’ll naturally lose the overshoot.i’ve never been at this weight in my life - my weight was very stable before my ed and it wasn’t even that different to ny lowest weight but now i’m so much higher than what i was before my ed even started. i feel so ashamed. words cannot describe how much hatred i have towards my body. i would do anything to lose weight naturally. on social media especially tt there are many glow up trends and their ‘glow up’ is basically weight loss. it’s so triggering and it keeps reinforcing the idea that losing weight is glowing up.maybe it’s our beauty standards but i think i look better when im thinner and i want to go back to that so badly. please help i don’t know what to do. im feeling even more suicidal bc of my ed and the immense pressure of school. i’ve burnt out and im not even able to shower or clean my room. this all happened when i gained weight and bc of my ed. i wish i never went on that stupid diet - my body was fine before my ed - i just completely ruined it. is there any hope of my body going back to how it was before my ed started - bc if not i know i’ll definitely relapse. even if it does i literally can’t stand another day beinf this huge.i really apologise if ive triggered anybody - i’m just in a really negative place right now and my ed voice is really loud. please don’t take anything i say personally. i know it’s my ed voice.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,10/12/2021-1:50am","Hi lulu601, we’re sorry to hear about these difficult feelings recently.

  Please stay safe and keep posting on the forums. You matter. ",recoveryj,"Tue,10/12/2021-7:52am","My heart is breaking for you right now. Please know you are so far from alone in this. It is definitely the ED voice and society’s toxic ideas of thinness that are driving these thoughts, but that doesn’t make them any less real or any less painful. I’m so sorry it’s so loud and overwhelming for you right now. You’ve made it so far in recovery. Try to remember how much strength that takes and how amazing you are.
Society and diet culture thrive on insecurities and promoting eating disorders. It’s sick and it’s wrong, but they are literally selling eating disorders to vulnerable people. That’s how they make a profit. Society’s idea of “beauty” isn’t so much about beauty as it is making a profit. The “ideals” are so out of reach for a reason - companies promote these unachievable images because that’s how they make a profit. They know people will have to control/manipulate/abuse their own bodies to achieve it, and that’s how they make money. They’re monetizing out bodies. And it’s sick.
Body diversity IS what makes people beautiful! And bodies change all throughout the course of life. One of the things I’ve had to come to terms with is that, since I developed my ED in my teens, my body was still supposed to be growing/maturing. That means that I will never have the body I had pre ED. Because I am an adult now. And that’s okay. I shouldn’t have the body of a teenager. Sometimes it can be difficult to see the natural maturation of our bodies when we suppress their natural growth and change for so long. It’s okay that you’re in a different body right now. What can this new body do for you now that you’re in recovery? How can you honor this new body and allow it to be and to change? The more you try to listen to and nourish your body, the more it will settle and learn how it can eat function for you. It sounds like you are under a ton of stress right now. Bodies reflect that too. I know my body always feels (and even looks) worse when I am anxious/stressed. I try not to look at myself too much when I feel this way because I know I’m likely to see a warped image of myself just because of my anxiety.
You deserve to eat. You deserve to show yourself care and compassion. You deserve to stay in recovery and away from the toxicity of ED. Your body, at any size, matters. You matter. And if you can’t get to a place of acceptance/love right now, that’s okay. Just try to be open and curious. Explore the “what if”. “What if I treated my body with kindness?” “What if I actually felt care and compassion toward my body?” “What if I even loved my body?” It is in these “what if’s” that we can begin to explore ourselves and detach from all the harm and pain from EDs and society in general.
You are worthy of love and care. In any body. In any size. You are beautiful.",lulu601,"Mon,11/01/2021-10:03pm",thank you so so much recovery j im always so grateful to you because you leave the sweetest comments - i rly wish the best for you too and thank you for leaving such a comforting comment. ur so amazing - thank you for always comforting and helping others. we’re all very grateful towards you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,10/13/2021,Idon'twanttoberecovered,kcporter6,"If I were making an objective guess, I'm like 90% completely recovered. I'm doing better than I ever was, but the whole time I've been thinking, ""I'm only eating to make people stop watching, I'll be anorexic again."" I'm so stressed now. I weigh more than I ever have in my life, I don't count calories at all anymore, and most importantly, I can see a little more clearly that my life was actually miserable when I was anorexic. It's so repetitive, ""I was always cold and tired"" and ""everything revolved around food and calories in/out"" but I finally like realized it about my own life. I'm glad I do not have an eating disorder anymore, but I am still dealing with mental illness. It took everything I had and about a year to get over losing my ED, and it was a pretty mild short-lived case, too. I don't have it in me to get over BPD and severe social anxiety, too. I also am graduating with an AA degree soon, so I have to move on with my real life, too, move out, go to college, start a career. It's like I lost everything, and now I have to start again. It's so stressful, and being anorexic was so much easier. It wasn't easy but it was easier, it was simple. I have had minimal support, partially my own fault, and I actually have been pushing forward in ED recovery recently, but like every time I get triggered on social media, or something stressful happens, all I want to do is starve to death. I don't even know where I'm going with this but I guess does anyone else feel like this?",Annet,"Wed,10/13/2021-9:08pm","Sorry that I do not have any words of wisdom but I only know that once we are close to full recovery, we do feel like missing our ED friend (or enemy?)It might have almost killed us, it might have made our lives miserable but still, we miss it. I compare this feeling to a marriage where things went really bad but still the partners want to keep together.Sometimes I also want to be back to my anorexia days (please notice that I have never wanted to be back to my BED or Bulimic days).Life is full of challenges and our ED's are a way to cope with them. They also distract us from the things we really need to face.I would say, give recovery a chance. You have worked too hard to get to the place you are. Let it be 100%.Hugs
Annet",lulu601,"Mon,10/18/2021-7:08pm","hi i read what you’ve written and i can relate to you so strongly. same with you i’m nearly recovered but i miss my ed so much and i really want to relapse. i keep telling myself after i get back on track with exams and start doing better in school i’ll starve myself again so i’m not too sure what advice to give you because i’m going through the same thing. however all i can tell you my love is please remember why you started - sometimes we forget the horrible reality of our ed’s because we felt numb most of the time. why did you choose recovery? do you think you didn’t know you’d gain weight? of course you did yet you still chose recovery, why? because your ed was so hellish you knew you wanted to get better. i too had anorexia but mine was atypical so i know exactly what ur talking about. i too miss everything and just want to starve myself when my life is going south but remember our ed is a coping mechanism. and there are so many better healthier coping strategies other than our ed’s. in fact our ed’s are probably the worst ones available. but because we’re so familiar with it and because it’s much easier to do that than journal or go therapy we tend to lean more towards it. but i promise you my love that if we fall back into our ed’s we will not be able to enjoy life. do you think you can enjoy your life counting calories and having anxiety about what ur going to put in ur mouth everyday? of course not. plus think about how many years of your life you’re going to waste being stuck in your eating disorder - when you’re older and might have grandchildren etc you’re going to look back at your life and the only think you’ll remember is you religiously calculating each and everything piece of food that you consume. do you think you’ll think it was worth it? what about when you can’t undo all the damages you have done to your organs and heart. do you want to die because of heart failure? i struggle with feeling worthy so these things don’t matter to me that much but i know for some people it can really motivate to them to carry on with their recovery. however something that really helps me when i feel like i don’t deserve to recover is just acknowledging the fact that i was sick when i was starving myself. i don’t know what physical symptoms you dealt with or emotional symptoms but for me it was hair loss and period loss - this enough shows me that my ed was really bad for me and was physically damaging me. which doesn’t matter to me however it’s an indication that i was sick - and just remembering that all the time helps me eat. i think to myself that i’m doing what i’m supposed to - i fed my body because it needed food. another thing that helps me a lot which i hope helps you too is thinking why you stopped in the first place - for me right before i started recovery i had hit rock bottom - i couldn’t stop binging no matter how much i tried. i couldn’t diet even if i tried to. and every little thing would make me cry - i was always so miserable and sensitive. i resented everyone for being able to eat the foods they want. and for that reason i knew i needed to recover. we have both made it so far - why not see what’s waiting for us at the end of the tunnel? we can accomplishing so much while we’re recovered that has nothing to do with our weight. do you think people will be talking about how much you weighed at your funeral? probably not - they’ll only remember your strengths and characteristics. so why live a life isolating yourself from the whole world. i promise that no matter what weight you’ll be at even if you relapse you’ll still not be happy. because nobody who has an ed is happy with themselves - that’s why it’s so dangerous. because you have such a distorted image of what you look like you keep losing more weight and you still feel dissatisfied. so what’s the point of relapsing if you’re still not gonna be happy with the way you look. it’s almost impossible to feel good when you’re deep into your ed - life just becomes about food and weight. you’ll miss out on so many opportunities and more importantly you’ll be suffering with a mental illness masked with the image of ‘helping yourself cope’. i really sincerely hope you get better and if you can i strongly suggest you discuss this with a mental health professional. if that’s not possible please speak with someone whom you trust and cares about you. i wish you all the best, fighting!!",lulu601,"Mon,10/18/2021-7:26pm","triggering comments on social media literally destroy every ounce of positivity in me so i deeply relate with you about this but what really helps me is just turning my device off and letting myself breathe. i try and forget about what i saw or read and i just give myself a moment to notice and observe my emotions. how is this making me feel what do i want to do as a result of these emotions? and i just write everything down - i rant and vent and just dump all of my emotions down in a notepad or on my iphone. if you need to write your emotions down in an application and just type it - you don’t need to handwrite it. heck you can even use your laptop. just do whatever you need to do to let it out. go for a run, talk to a friend, scream, cry, read a book - literally do anything you need to do to make you feel better because seriously triggers are the worst part about recovery other than weight gain. lastly i also deeply relate with you about my ed beinf short lived and quite mild - i was only restricting for 3/4 months and i only lost a little bit of weight however it has taken me over two years to get to where i am. i was never hospitalised nor did i become underweight but i still had anorexia and it was still completely valid. i lost my period for a few months and i lost a lot of hair - more than you can imagine. my point is not matter how short lived ir was no matter how much weight you lost your ed is completely valid. please don’t let this affect your perception of recovery - you deserve to recover no matter what. u personally experienced this a lot and i always felt like my ed was ‘fake’ just because i never got diagnosed but that’s because i couldn’t access mental health services. there were many boundaries preventing me from getting diagnosed. regardless of what it is you deserve recovery, you deserve to eat. i also wanted to mention i too am at the highest weight i’ve ever been in my life - i’m well over my pre ed weight however you know what? i’m still living, yes it’s really difficult but it’s possible to recovery and cope with it. i know it’s so scary and hard but i promise it’s okay to gain weight. it’s okay to be the heaviest you’ve ever been. to us it’s the scariest thing in the world and actually it’s a nightmare but do you think the people around us have even noticed? probably not and even if they have they probably don’t care. even if they care i guarantee you they don’t care half as much as you do. so please don’t stress about it - you’ll be okay. this too shall pass and you’ll be able to overcome this as well. you’ll be able to get through it. please stay strong !!",_admin_moderator,"Mon,10/18/2021-10:35pm","Hi Lulu - you mentioned some concerning feelings in your post and we wanted to make sure you know there are resources if you ever need to reach out for support:

Everyone says that it goes away with time and consistency, but I've been in recovery for 9 months and reached weight restoration over a month ago, and it's still very severe. Is anyone else struggling with this? Is it normal to last this long and be so severe? I wake up bloated in the mornings too and it makes it very uncomfortable to eat.",2Healthy4me,"Sat,10/30/2021-6:04pm","After I had eaten too much salt, following my diet of healthy foods, My belly was beginning to bloat outwards daily. I also wear a face mask at work, and have noticed that I am not letting go of the oxygen which needs to be exhaled. I breath In but Not sufficiently when i breath out.
I have found that this also has affected my abdominal area in distending out, Therefore zipping up the front tummy area of my pants
is becoming a chore. I do not wear dresses often. If I do it's on a bloated day and therefore I cant fit
into my blue jeans, so a dress is my last resort of what I choose to wear for the day.............Good luck with your bloating problem, and enjoy a nice walk every once in a while. I also journal, and watch Netflix, and keep busy with housekeeping duties and paying my bills.Take care of yourself and practice mindful breathing, ""In and Out.""It may be something other than food.

I have seen a few doctors about it and they think it's still just my body getting used to food, and is most likely a gluten and dairy sensitivity. We tried ruling them out for a couple weeks and it definitely helped, but eliminating gluten and dairy from my diet is too restrictive for my recovery and caused other problems so that's something to look at further down the track.

5,10/26/2021,relapsed,cyclone569,"I'm a 19 year old sophomore in college and I was so nervous about going to college and relapsing. I eventually ended up telling my roommates about it(I didn't want to but it came up and rather than lie, I just let them know what was actually going on) and they kind of kept an eye on me and I didn't end up relapsing the first semester of freshmen year or even genuinely thinking about it. Things got stressful at the start of the second semester and sometimes, I would get this like feeling to just throw up because it would make me feel better but I was too scared to start again plus my roommates would've been able to hear me because the three of us shared such a small space so I never really did. During the month of May, I moved home for the summer and started binging without really realizing it. My parents were watching me but I think they were just happy that I wasn't making myself purge so they didn't say anything. Then I started working in June and I just fell into restricting. I was straight restricting for months until this past week and I feel like I'm binging but I can't tell if I'm binging or just eating like a normal person. I feel on the verge of like a breakdown, I keep wanting to purge everytime I eat and everything reminds me of it, I just can't stop and I'm so tired and this never goes away and this is going to be my entire life amd i can't even complain because I did it to myself and my doctor noticed my weightloss and now she wants an appointment in two weeks to check my weight and I just want to go back to normal. On top of that, I've started hooking up with random guys adjacent to my friend group because it makes me feel better and it's validating the whole sick cycle in some way because I didn't mess around with a single guy during recovery and now I'm just freewheeling and guys actually like me because I'm thinner and I have no idea what's going on and I feel like everyone is watching me and my roommate keeps asking when the last time I ate was and then she asked what happened to all the bagels and I can't get that out of my head.",2Healthy4me,"Sat,10/30/2021-6:13pm","When you feel like panicking just breath into a paper bag. Try journaling to see if you might discover a trigger to what you are explaining. Find a counselor on campus, they are usually free to enrolled college students. Are you onsite in college this year, or at parents home and using a computer?I ask this because there is quite a big transition going from onsite college to working at home online for college course load.

Good luck in your Healing Recovery from Ed.",recoveryj,"Sun,10/31/2021-7:47am","I’m so sorry you’re going through all this. College can be such a stressful transition and bring up so many triggers. A lot of the time, it does feel like a binge when we start eating normally after restriction. Know that this is just your body’s way of trying to take care of you and get you what you need. I know it can feel so scary at times, but you should be incredibly proud of yourself for not purging. That is a huge step in the recovery process.
Are you in touch with an eating disorder dietician at all? It can be so helpful just to have someone to help guide you on gentle nutrition. I know my meal plan has been essential to my recovery. They can help you come up with something that helps fit your personal needs so that you get the nourishment you need throughout the day. The “binges” will subside as long as you keep nourishing and feeding your body. I know it’s so hard sometimes. But know that your eating disorder is not you. You are worthy and deserving of care. And you do deserve to recover and regain your life

6,10/27/2021,WeightGain,laineyrae,"I am currently in recovery from Anorexia nervosa (restrictive type). I started eating normally, but then feel selfish for eating. I then relapse and begin restricting. However, after dinner I would get a sweet snack. This sweet treat would result in me eating more than I thought I should. I am so scared of gaining weight. Does anybody else experience or know how to deal with these “binges”.Although I am afraid of gaining weight, I have definitely gained some weight. It has all gone to my stomach, and it is not as flat as it used to be.Does anybody else have this issue where all of your restored wait because her stomach?Does anybody know if this weight eventually distributes?",recoveryj,"Fri,10/29/2021-7:45am","A lot of the time, “binges” like you are speaking of come from a place of restriction, which sounds like what is happening for you. It’s your body’s natural way of trying to protect and take care of you. Please don’t beat yourself up about it. It really is okay, and a normal part of the recovery process. If it is distressing to you, it may be helpful to try to get more nourishment throughout the day. Then your body won’t feel like it needs so much later on. I know it can be so hard to do that with the ED guilt hanging over our heads. But you do deserve to nourish and feed your body what it needs. You do deserve recovery. And as far as weight gain goes, every body has a different timeline. A lot of the time, it has to do with the amount of damage done and how much the body has to repair. That takes priority. And then things will start to even out. As difficult and terrifying as it is, sometimes we just have to trust our bodies and lean in to the process. You can do this. If you need some extra help or support, I highly recommend getting in touch with an ED dietician or therapist (or both). They can really help bring us back into reality and out of ED thought patterns. Keep going. It will get better. And you do deserve food and freedom.

7,08/20/2021,Thoughtsofself-harm(Iamsafe),Annet,"I have been in recovery for 3 years, now. I basically eat normally and exercise for a healthy amount of time. Unfortunately, reducing the time of my workouts has literally increased my anxiety levels to the sky. I know I used to be an elite level athlete and that for years, exercise became my way to let  my anxiety go. Lately, my body just can not cope even with the ""normal exercise time"" for a healthy person. That has been pretty frustrating for me. The problem is that now, there are days when I just can not stop thinking of self-harming. I have NEVER done it and I do not want to get into that terrible habit. Unfortunately, all the things that I try just do not seem to help with my anxiety levels.I see a therapist and a psychiatrist. I had these thoughts in the past but they faded away.
Now, they are back again. I am trying to do all that my therapist told me to avoid having to workout more than the needed. But she does not know I am starting to have self-harm thoughts.I am planning to tell her. But I feel ridiculous just to think of talking about it. At the end, I have not done it. I am not sure if it is just that some time back, I told my pdoc about it and she just did not take it seriously (believe it).My therapist is different. She will surely listen to me. But this is soooo ashaming.
Also, I do not know if I will be able to resist the urges until Tuesday.I am with my family this weekend. So, that will help. But that is where I am right now.Annet",kcporter6,"Sat,08/21/2021-1:13am","First of all, I definitely agree to talk it out with your therapist. No one should feel the need to harm themselves, no matter how, in order to relieve pain or anxiety or whatnot. My history with self-harm is pretty mild thankfully, but it never actually helped me. It always made me feel more ashamed and if it ever helped me with my emotions, it was too short-lived to remember.
Another thing, I was in a crisis a few weeks ago and decided I should see my therapist again after not seeing her for two months. I wasn't a threat to myself but it was similar and I wasn't sure if I could keep myself in damage control mode for six days until my appointment. I spent several hours on crisis lines, and ultimately, with those situations, sometimes you really do just have to distract yourself and sit it out. It sucks when you can't help yourself, but maintaining your mood is still better than making it worse. If you feel you need to, crisis lines can be helpful, if nothing else, you can just vent.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,08/23/2021-1:31pm","Dear kcporter6, since you mentioned having thoughts of self-harm, we would like to share the following resources.

If I can keep one person from going down that path, then it would all be worth it. I haven't self harmed in over ten years but I still get pretty intense thoughts sometimes when the anxiety peaks.

This is my 3rd week of rest. Let's see how long I can handle this for.Overall, I am doing well with food and any ED thoughts. The self-harm thoughts have also started to fade away.

It can be so difficult, especially with ED, to let ourselves do that. But it is so, so necessary. Exercise is fine, but it can easily become detrimental and work against recovery and health.

Maybe someday you’ll be able to move your body in ways that feel positive and affirming to you without the ED thoughts or the risk of harm. But even if you never “formally exercise” again, that does not make you any less of a person. And it doesn’t make you any less deserving of recovery and healing.

8,10/21/2021,WeddingDressSadness,RoseyDanes,"Only a year into recovery and 20 days is my wedding.  It's not fancy at all, like just the officiate, a few family members and the two of us.  Not even sure where we are having it.  It's all had to be a bit haphazard, being that he is from the UK and we are jumping on a window between now and the next Covid lock down.  Anyway, we never expected the wedding itself would be anything major but I had set aside this pretty little dress I got when I graduated college some years ago.  Back then, when I put it on it was too big for me, so I figured I was in the clear when I gained so much weight during recovery.  But no... it doesn't fit... at all.  Like, no chance in hades.  And considering that our wedding was already gonna have to be done in this less than ideal way... having that little special dress was kinda comforting.  But now, I can't even dream to wear it.  And I dunno, it's making me really sad.  It's not even a wedding dress.  And my sister and mom can't make it to the wedding so I can't try on dresses with them.I dunno, I just feel really sad.  I do have another cute dress that I'm talking to everyone about wearing.  But honestly, I just feel very unworthy of a wedding dress and afraid to shop for one alone.  Like, I don't have a wedding dress for my wedding and I'm too ashamed to go buy one alone where I will have to look at a body I don't recognize.  I don't even know where to start with this body!  I still haven't bought new bras!  It's so disorienting.  I was anorexic for soooo long.  I don't understand this body at all.",2Healthy4me,"Sat,10/23/2021-6:11pm","I had to donate many articles of clothing, including the beautiful cocktail dresses which I had saved for weekends w/ my friends. This last year I went to try on my old clothing, purchased a few yrs ago, and none of them fit. I did not beat myself up. I decided that I need to work on toning up. I placed all my old clothes , that did not fit, into the donation clothing bin.I re-ordered a bunch of Macy jeans online. They arrived and they all fit my new measurements Perfectly. Just go shopping, online is fun too. You just need to measure your areas where the clothes will fit. Then go online shopping and order your hearts desires.Yes, I was mad at myself for having to waste money on new clothes, more like guilty for having to donate my clothes most recently.But, hey I made a donation to my fellow female seekers of necessary cocktail dresses and now I feel better.Just have fun and forget about the weight or inches gained over these last 2 Covid years of sheltering in place.I had to give up the gym and swimming. I took up walking 3x a week or so and gained a new 2nd job in retail grocery and pharmacy sales. I am back to my former job #1 and that's where I plan to where my new, perfectly fitting mail order jeans from Macy's.I hope that you may feel better and forgive yourself for your body's changing and evolving beyond your expectations. I wish you the best of luck in the wedding and hope you may find a new substitute dress that fits perfectly and you have a fun, cherished, memorable day at your wedding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,10/19/2021,idon'tknowhowtolikemyselfanymore,pblover,"i developed an eating disorder during my first year of college. i became obsessed with losing weight. even though i lost my period, my hands were always purple bc i was so cold, i skipped social events because i didnt want to go over my calories, and i binged whenever i drank, i still loved being skinny. i saw it as an identity, and i placed all of my self worth in my weight. my senior year of college, we were sent home due to covid. then, i binged all the time and stopped tracking calories since i didnt have the pressure of seeing anyone i knew and i assumed i would lose the weight before i went back to school. eventually, i gained back the weight i lost in college, and i started to hate myself. i thought i was a failure and that everyone would think i had glowed down / let myself go. so i hid from all of my friends for a year and tried a bunch of fast methods to lose weight. these diets always failed bc my body was still demanding so much food. now, i have shared my ED story with my friends and apologized for being so distant. i am excited to see them again, but i am so so so nervous. i am no longer partaking in any anorexic behaviors and i'm not underweight, but i still had ED thoughts. i hate looking in the mirror, i hate taking photos of myself, i hide from people i recognize in public, and whenever i see someone i haven't seen since before the pandemic, i just obsess over how they are judging me for gaining weight. i truly dont know how to like myself or gain back the confidence that i had when i was at my skinniest. i feel like hiding forever",_admin_moderator,"Wed,10/20/2021-2:03pm","Welcome to the forums Pblover!

11,10/17/2021,Bulimiarecoverer(strugglingBAD),rykla34,"Hi, this is so hard for me to even let people know that I am a struggler with an eating disorder. Where do I even start?A year and a half ago, I called my mother crying begging her to help me lose weight because I have been bullied for the 7 years before that (since elementary school) about my weight. I had finally hit X bs. I hated myself but it didn’t help that other people let me know they didn’t like how I looked either. Then my ex told all of his friends he was only dating me because I would let him do whatever he wanted, but…I was “too fat” for him to care about cheating on me. So I took it upon myself and my mother’s word to start a diet. That diet lasted 2 weeks.I ended up throwing up every single meal I ever ate. Up until about a month ago, I was fine with dying honestly. I lost so many more friends losing weight than I even had when I had the weight on me. I can’t participate in gym activities anymore, I don’t have the strength. And I can’t play the sport that had my absolute heart growing up. This past year I wasn’t only battling eating disorder, outside of everything going on including the disorder, I was battling with drugs. Now, 2 months and a week sober. And I now suffer with paranoia and anxiety so bad that I can’t go outside and see a group of people without shaking so badly that I don’t even understand why.My own mother tells me how skinny I am. I have gained since then but in pictures I’m so much skinnier than everyone else and I hate it. It’s funny cuz I used to hate being the biggest one and now I hate being the smallest. I am in recovery but struggling. I can keep it in until I look in the mirror and see the extra fat I’ve gained so I relapse. And I haven’t had any help and I don’t want any but I do want advice. As much advice as anyone would like to give. I don’t want to feel full. I hate that feeling. But I do want to gain weight so I can have the strength to gain muscle. It got so bad, i started getting paranoid and started accusing my friends and family of having eating disorders. It hurts a lot but I realized that one of my friends did gain an eating disorder….and that’s my fault for losing that much weight. But I convinced myself that if drugs couldn’t kill me then I will just wait for my disorder to. But that’s enough. I’m so young. My life isn’t the best, but it’s not even close to the worst. I have so much more life to live, I just want to recognize the me in the mirror. I want to live. I want to love myself. I want me and my life back.If you’re a struggler as well I just wanted to let you know that you are NOT alone. You’re so loved and cared for and I’m so proud of you for taking this step as well just to even come on here and read these.

12,10/14/2021,SevereBulimiaRecovery-AShocktoTheSystem,theuhmiamouse,"Hello, there!I am a bulimic in recovery for the first time in 10 years. These first months of recovery have been a complete shock to my system. I often feel sicker than when I was active in my disorder. I always knew it would take something drastic and out of my control to break out of the cycle of my decade-long eating disorder. That day came when I left my job 3 months ago.I had worked there for 11 years and broken heartedly decided to exit when I realized they were grossly abusing my work ethic and truly did not appreciate my value.Such a big life change shocked the desire to maintain my eating disorder right out of me. I don’t think I realized how much my work stress was fueling my behaviors. My career was the basis of my identity and I felt lost without it after I left- recovery wasn’t even a thought and I did not feel so much as the temptation to binge or purge past the moment I left my job.The course of my life changed in an instant, it only felt natural that the disordered part of my life vanished as well. In the beginning, I began eating small healthy meals once or twice a day, not enough to shock my system as this drastic life change made me anxious and depressed for quite some time. Eating normal or large amounts wasn’t an option at such a vulnerable time. I didn’t have much of an appetite for a month or so. It has now been 3 months and I am finally eating normally for the first time since I was 18. I eat as I like, healthy food or not, and am trying not to let my mind even go to a place where I could feel regret for anything I choose to fuel my body with. I may even be eating too much junk day-to-day. But I’m reveling in the fact that my mind isn’t telling me no or causing guilt. I’m trying to feed myself whenever I feel like it just because it’s such a joy to finally be free. But this willingness to return to completely free, thoughtless eating has certainly taken a toll on my vulnerable body. Now that my intake has increased so significantly I’m finding my body’s desperation to repair and sudden influx of guilt-free food of all kinds has it breaking down.I’ve started retaining water and salt like crazy- typically above my knees down to my ankles. As well as the to-be-expected constant gas. Aside from that, I’ve started having daily anxiety/panic attacks over the state of my health and am constantly over analyzing symptoms with the fear that my ED already went too far and I’m surely dying. Before, my life was about ignoring any negative symptoms because I didn’t want to confront the impact of my Bulimia. But now it’s the opposite. I’m obsessed with finding and healing every potential effect of my long term ED as quickly as possible. It’s exhausting and terrifying- I find something new every day that scares me into overthinking that it’s surely a sign of something irreversible or life threatening. I have a very active new job where I am on my feet or lifting heavy boxes all day. At the end of the day my legs become weak and shaky, mostly from the swelling above my knees as I retain water and salt while suddenly building new muscle I haven’t worked out in years.I can tell my poor circulation is changing as I eat more food, and even feeling my blood flow go to new places can send me into panic that it’s a sign that I’ve irreparably damaged something. As a person with a long term ED to go through a recovery this swift and severe with no real medical observation or intervention is truly scary. Though I’m no longer experiencing any anxiety over my weight or food intake, it’s quickly shifted to uncontrollable panic over my health as I face the impacts of my bulimia and freely refeeding myself so very quickly. I just needed to reach out to those who can relate to this. I know my situation is strange having had my ED shut off like a light switch. But maybe someone can relate and confirm the severe changes I’m facing are to be expected recovering this quickly and recklessly so I feel less afraid.Thanks so much.",recoveryj,"Sun,10/17/2021-11:05am","First of all, I want to give you a huge congratulations on the steps you’ve taken toward recovery! You are amazing! That takes so much courage and so much strength. I can definitely resonate with the fears - each twinge can sometimes send us into an anxiety spiral like “did I do something wrong? Have I done permanent damage?”  Know that our bodies are so much smarter than we sometimes give them credit for! Yes, it may take them a while to heal, and it may not always look or feel like what we expect. But they are working FOR us. They are prioritizing our needs.  That being said, I truly do recommend getting in touch with a doctor/dietician who specializes in eating disorders. If nothing else, they can help assuage the fears during the healing process. There is a lot of repair work that bodies need to do after the havoc eating disorders wreak. Maybe just having someone walking with you along the way might ease the anxiety. I know I wouldn’t have gotten anywhere without my team
Keep nourishing yourself and taking care. Sending love and strength!",rykla34,"Sun,10/17/2021-9:25pm",I just wanted to say thank you. And I’m over beyond proud and inspired. You got this!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,10/13/2021,Stuck,Keb93,"HelloFirst time here.I'm about 6 months into recovery, but I'm stuck. Psychologically my relationship with food is worse than ever, but in the sense that I've essentially 'gone off' everything!When I go to the shops I'm on the verge of panic attacks trying to work out what I'm supposed to get to eat. When I do buy myself ingredients or ready meals or components of a meal, by the time I get home I can't think of anything worse to eat. I Google recipes and look on delivery sites but as soon as I see photos of the foods or think about them for too long I start to feel really nauseous.I live with housemates and we're all on conflicting schedules, so I only have myself to rely on to decide what to make and eat, but it's getting more and more debilitating every day, and for snacks, it's even worse. Everything feels like it has too much flavour, it's too strong, or on the opposite hand, it's seems like the blandest dryest thing in the world.At the moment I'm basically living on bread, which is something but leaves me feeling pretty bad mentally and physically at the end of the day.I don't know what I'm supposed to do to, but this needs to stop. It's stressing me out in ways I can't describe and making recovery feel impossible.I'm waiting to begin therapy from the eating disorder team in my local NHS but still have at least 3 months to go.Please help!Thank you x",_admin_moderator,"Sat,10/16/2021-1:44pm","​​Hi keb93, welcome to the forums!

15,10/07/2021,"Newto‘recovery’forthefirsttimeinyears,amIclosetobeingrecovered?",fr053n,"Hi everyone, I’m new here and am currently celebrating 100 days binge/purge free! For background, my ED started 14 years ago when I was about 14 years old (wow, that’s half of my life!) I started out copying my sisters habits, who unfortunately suffered from a bad case of anorexia. I initially thought I was just losing the extra weight but it spiraled into a new lifestyle and way of thinking about myself and any interaction with good that I had. I became more reclusive and wouldn’t join others for lunch, dinner, etc. but my ED was more important to me. As I started my senior year of college, I met my first boyfriend, who ensured me that gaining weight would be better for me and that I would look much better. At the time, that and an antidepressant was all it took for me to let go and finally be okay with gaining weight. In just few months of intense binge eating (or maybe this was refeeding), I gained some weight. I couldn’t get enough sugar or carbs and would eat until I was stuffed every day. Fast forward to having a full time job, I found solace in my old eating habits and dropped a lot of the extra weight pretty quickly. I settled into a rather healthy weight for me and my eating fears seem to have calmed down, as I realized how much food it actually took to gain weight. Over the years, as I got more stressed out at my job, I seem to have slipped back into obsessing over extra calories. And this time, it came with the disgusting addition of sometimes purging after I “overdid it” (at the time, I didn’t consider it a binge.) I think it’s interesting how slowly it developed, almost tricking me into thinking I hadn’t changed at all. But it was slow the first time around as well.It took a turn for the worse when I mixed alcohol into the equation and became more concerned about my daily drink(s) than my body weight or appearance. But not entirely. I became what is apparently known as drunkorexic, where I would save my calories for the alcohol I would consume. Because I still wanted to stay thin, no matter how unhealthy. As the drinking become more of an issue, the hinges would happen more frequently, and so would the purges. Eventually, I was bingeing and purging up to 4 times a day and would plan my entire day around eating and where to throw it up. Now it wasn’t a slip up anymore, it was pre-meditated. How did I get here?The alcoholism definitely contributed to the binge purge cycle, but even during times of abstinence I couldn’t quite shake the cycle. It was the only coping mechanism I knew. Everything else seemed out of reach, like I just wouldn’t be able to think about anything else or enjoy anything else. It had fully consumed me.This was my life for the last 2.5 years. Only in the past 100 days have I stopped cold turkey. I haven’t allowed myself to drink in any setting except social settings and have a limit of drinks. I also have not purged a single time. Now, I will say that I have “binged”, or what I would consider a binge in the moment, even when it really wasn’t. (Note: there were times during my ED when I would binge a lot calories) But in the past few years, my anorexic mindset was in full force, so even just the feeling of fullness would trigger an emotional response, leading me to want to purge. I always wanted to feel empty.I guess I would like to know if you guys think I can be considered “recovered” when I still struggle with thoughts of guilt after a heavy meal and the odd urges to purge, although I do not act on them.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,10/08/2021-2:19pm","Hi Fro53n!

That is a GREAT accomplishments and it talks about how committed you are to recovery.
Recovery is a process and takes some time. I think you are still in the path to recovery.
Stopping behaviours is the first part. The second part is reframing all the distorted thoughts we often have.
Keep going. The more you show your body how living a healthy life looks like, the more those ED thoughts will fade away.Great job!",recoveryj,"Sat,10/09/2021-6:44am","Thank you for being so open and sharing your journey with us. And congratulations on the amazing steps you’re taking toward recovery. It can be so difficult to fight against the thoughts and urges, especially when, like you said, they can seemingly creep up on you out of nowhere. It takes so much strength to be able to sit in that discomfort and deny your eating disorder. But the more you do it, the easier it becomes.
For me, recovery has been, and probably always will be a journey. And it’s anything but linear. There will be ups and downs, but what’s important is the direction you’re heading. And it sounds like you’re pointed in the right way. It really is amazing that you’re able to identify disordered thoughts and then not act on them. That is such a huge step in recovery. And I agree with Annet; working on reframing those can be the next step toward freedom. Sometimes, a therapist can help with this. Are you currently seeing someone? I’ve found that writing about it sometimes helps too - just getting those thoughts and feelings out of my head. It helps to process and then objectively look at them.
Overall though, huge, huge congratulations. You have come so far. You have the strength and power to keep going <3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,09/26/2021,4monthsinandstruggling,Mustlovedogs,"I'm a 29 year old female, who's suffered from some form of ED since I was about 12 years ago. I've never had a normal relationship with food or my body. In these last couple of years, I went down a very miserable path of bulimia, restricting in between binges, and also drinking a ton of alcohol. The same day I decided to quit drinking, I also officially decided to start trying to recover from my ED and reclaim my life. I'm almost 4 months in and I feel pretty awful. I constantly have lower abdomen pain, and severe bloating and gas. It feels like I'm allergic to absolutely everything, there's nothing that doesn't set my guts off - but I'm still trying to make sure I don't set any restrictions on what I eat. I am CONSTANTLY exhausted. Next level exhaustion. I sleep for upwards of 10 hours a night, wake up still exhausted, and constantly am nodding off all day - I need constant naps just to get through the day. It's been near impossible to work. My question... is this normal?? Has anyone else experienced these things in recovery? It's hard to sometimes not want to go back to the way it was before. I'm gaining weight consistently, which I know is necessary, but still so hard.. and still feeling physically and mentally awful. I thought I would be feeling better by now.Anyways, I'm sorry I've been ranting... I'm just, feeling a little lost. Any insight is appreciated.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,09/27/2021-12:20am","Hi Mustlovedogs, thank you for posting. We’re sorry to hear about how what’s been going on recently.

That is such a scary place to be, and your commitment shows your amazing strength and how much you do want to get better.
A lot of what you’re describing definitely mirrors some of my own experiences.  It takes the body a while to both remember how to properly process food after restriction as well as repair all the damage done by EDs.  Eating disorders wreak havoc on the body and the internal organs in ways we can’t see. When we start refeeding, it is common to experience many of the symptoms you’re going through as the body adjusts and tries to undo all that damage. It’s okay to rest. Your body is healing itself. Just keep going; keep nourishing. It does get better.
That said, are you working with a team? If not, I highly recommend seeking a dietician who specializes in eating disorders. They may be able to help you come up with a comfortable plan that helps you in your recovery. NEDA has resources for looking for practitioners in your area if you need a place to start.
Keep going. You are not alone. You deserve to eat. You deserve to heal. You deserve recovery",fr053n,"Thu,10/07/2021-7:43pm","Oh wow, I have almost the exact same story and timeline.

17,05/11/2020,Newhereandhavingahardtime,catdragonfly,"Hi everyone. I'm pretty new to these boards. I worked really hard to find what I considered to be real recovery from ednos/osfed (anorexia and bulimia symptoms at various times). It took years and so many relapses and I finally spent a full year (a little over a year) feeling like I had things together! My personality came back, I was spending time with friends, dancing again (in a healthy way) and doing really well at my job. I even entered into an online spiritual training group. Things were great. Then, the pandemic happened. I'm a massage therapist and stressed about my future (I work for a franchise). I'm still expected to attend work meetings virtually until we open back up and my boss makes comments about us gaining weight or the amount of food we’re eating and thinks that it's funny. My coworkers (with the exception of my best friend) are no different in terms of weight jokes right now. That coupled with my dance rehearsals being sporadic and virtual, cancelled performances, feeling completely unable to plan, and looking at the prospect of being sent back to work sooner than expected, I am extremely stressed and a lot of old thoughts are running through my end. I am finding that I have to force myself to eat meals and sometimes it's just too hard. I also purged once and stopped myself another time. What the hell? I thought I was finally better.",Miggi,"Mon,05/11/2020-10:48pm","I'm sorry this is happening. Relapse can sometimes sneak up on us. Usually when we don't feel in control, and the weird dance schedule could be to blame for that. But, don't quit dancing, it is a tough situation to solve. Maybe try to gain control of the situation, get a group scheduling app for your dance like Next or the band app. When life gets tough for me, I turn to my food habits to calm myself. Likely limiting what I eat, but sometimes having an extra snack can be freeing, it really can. This is tough, but i believe you are tougher!",pupper,"Wed,05/20/2020-4:52pm","I can completely empathize with this. I thought I was in a really solid state of recovery for the past few years. Since the quarantine/pandemic hit, I've had feelings and thoughts pop up that I haven't felt in years, and it's really scary. I had been in a stable place where I felt good about my body and had developed healthy habits, and now everything's being turned upside down. I'm sorry about your boss, sounds like a real piece of work, ugh. Some things I've been turning to when I feel like butt include my pets (two rabbits who are very cute and fuzzy), deep breathing, my hobbies (I'm a musician and playing my instruments is kind of meditative for me), and reaching out to my friends and telling them about my feelings. It's especially hard when I feel really bad to remember to do one of these things. But when I get myself to take a break from the bad feels and just pet my bunnies, for instance, I feel better. Maybe even just making a list of the things you love and enjoy, and looking at that list, can help remind you of what makes you happy and can help you slow your brain down when you feel really stressed. Just an idea. Anyways, I believe in you! I think a lot of us are in the same boat right now, but we can get through this!!",Gaulithan,"Tue,10/05/2021-8:01am","Make a plan of action. To begin with, you need to exhale, stop, and realize that you have a negative emotion. The critical thing to understand here is that any feeling is normal, and panic is a human emotion just like any other. When you've realized that you are in a state of panic or stress, you can block it out. Massage helped me at one time. Second, give yourself an informational detox: minimize visits to portals that talk a lot about the problem causing you negative emotions. To stay informed and know what's going on, read the news only at certain times and only from trusted sources. Make a daily schedule for yourself.

18,09/30/2021,HardtoMoveOn,Journey2Heal,"This is my first time posting, so hello, all, and thanks for taking the time to read this. I've been in and out of recovery anorexia for about 10 years now. I'm feeling most positive about my recovery process this time around and I really feel like I'm on the cusp of making more progress than ever before! Which feels really amazing. My weight is restored, I have some great coping mechanisms in place, I feel good (most of the time), my relationships are good, food doesn't dominate my life anymore! BUT every once in a while I still get hung up on one thing. It's like my ED is still holding on to my brain just by a thread and telling me that it's not good to be okay. That it's not good to be healed. That I need to be 'sick'. I know that's not true but I guess ED has been in my life for so long that it's just become a part of me and I'm not entirely sure how to cut that last tie and be free.

I perfectly understand what you mean. I am somehow there and every time that I am close to break that final tie, I relapse or simply, I start using some behaviours.Sometimes, I wonder if I love my ED so much that I do not want to let it go.
Other times, I hate myself for not cutting the final tie.I think this is a process and it will take us some time to get convinced that we do not need our ED's in the back pocket. We need to let them go.I have also had an eating disorder for a long time (21 years). So, more than half of my life, I have been sick.Honestly, I do not remember how it feels like to be ""normal"".

19,09/29/2021,Tryingtohelpsomeonewithnoresponse,kcporter6,"A friend of mine has a friend with an eating disorder and I knew about it for several months, but since I didn’t know the girl I felt it wasn’t my place to reach out or say anything. Over the last six months, it seems like she has been getting smaller and so she must still be struggling. I reached out to her and she sent a brief thank you. I got a message from our mutual friend telling me her mom really appreciated it (she’s in high school) and that I should keep reaching out. I’ve sent her positive messages which she reads and doesn’t respond to. Yesterday I sent her a message that said something like “how are you really? I want to help you in any way I can” and even though I was asking her a question she read it and didn’t respond. I’d like to think it’s the kind of thing where I should keep checking in without a response to give her support. But also we don’t actually really know each other, just through the friend.

You should feel so proud of how far you’ve come. Remember that feelings are just that; feelings. And they are temporary. No feeling lasts forever. It’s okay to let the negative ones come.

Weight restoration can be so hard and so terrifying. But your life is beyond worth it. Your freedom is worth it. You’re allowed to feed your body what it needs AND what it wants. All the time.

26,10/19/2020,Bingeeating,smily26,"Hello everyone!
I can’t believe I’m actually writing this and that eventually someone is going to see it but I hope that it will help me or others!
I have anorexia for 5 years, struggling everyday. But now I have another problem which drains my energy and makes me feel so so sad and desperate, it’s the binge eating. During my recovery I couldn’t gain any weight but after those 5 years just one day I started to eat and binge eat so fast and unexpected. I don’t know how to stop it, I’ve tried anything anything.  I’m so so so scared. I gained weight and this horrifies me. I know that under binge eating there are major problems but even during my recovery from anorexia I couldn’t understand what it was, I was never depressed, I had friends even boyfriends. I guess I always hated myself and always wanted to be thin, now I want that again but every time when I try to loose weight and stop eat that much I start binging.
Please if someone has been to similar situation and have some advice for me I will appreciate it more that everything!!!!",recoveryj,"Tue,10/20/2020-8:40am","Binge eating often results as a response to restriction. I’d say the best way to help could be to stick to a meal plan that gives you the full nutrition you need throughout the day. Maybe that will that give you more energy and allow you to do the things you want to do, and maybe your body won’t be crying out for food at the end of the day? It won’t happen overnight, but restriction is never the answer. Have you ever met with an ED dietician? I’d highly recommend it. They can help you develop a meal plan that meets your needs and help combat both restricting and bingeing behaviors. If you’re not sure where to find someone, contact NEDA; they have a bunch of resources that can help you find someone in your area.",kshie,"Fri,09/24/2021-1:50pm","I am also dealing with some extreme binging.

27,09/24/2021,Returningtowork,kcporter6,"I’m 18 and in college, and I quit my job 8 months ago in food service because of mental health issues that were no longer manageable. I loved that job and I was really good at it so I’ve missed it every single day since. I’ve spent the last 8 months in therapy, resting, etc. and my problems are still pretty bad but I am pretty far into ED recovery, and I asked the manager if I could come back today. She was super nice and understanding and I’d tell her my availability in the next few weeks. I talked to her 3 hours ago and since then I’ve been having major anxiety over it (which isn’t new I have anxiety over everything I do). Objectively, I think working is good for me, doing nothing for so long has helped some but mostly made me a little stir crazy. Since I’m out of practice I would have to focus a lot of energy on working and not restricting or purging so it would distract me from ED thoughts. Additionally my most disabling issue right now is crippling social anxiety. I quit a club 3 weeks after I joined and just those 3 weeks were a big deal for me. I never leave home except to go to school, and I think working at a job I already know 1-2 shifts a week would help me assimilate more since social things don’t go so well. Overall I think it’s definitely a good thing, but I’m so apprehensive about it it’s worrisome. There is a reason I had to quit 8 months ago, maybe this is too impulsive and I should ease into it again. But I need to be able to work as an adult, and this is about as easy as it gets to start: good manager relationships, highly skilled already, familiar settings with low hours. I’m taking any and all advice to make this decision because I currently have a knot in my stomach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,09/20/2021,Ineedtochange.Butit’ssohard,recoveryj,"I’ve been in recovery for many years, and I still struggle with behaviors at times. I’ve gotten to a point where I can keep things at least under control when things get hard, and I make sure I am always eating enough. However, I am very out of tune with my body, and don’t really have reliable hunger or fullness cues.
Recently, I have had to begin hormone therapy. As a result of the damage from my eating disorder, I may have permanently damaged certain parts of my endocrine system. I have to start hormones because even though I’ve been able to “maintain”, without the proper hormone levels, my bones are disintegrating and my organs are stressed beyond capacity. So starting hormones is a step in the direction of health.
I have a new problem though. I have severe OCD and have a really difficult time with change. It seems like the hormones are having an effect on my metabolism, significant enough that I can’t ignore it. I have to figure out how to change the way I move my body and the way I eat in order to address these changes, or I’m afraid I’ll end up in the hospital. But I am finding it nearly impossible to break the patterns that have “worked” for me for so long.
I don’t know exactly what I’m looking for by posting; just nervous about the future and trying to change. I just hope I can before it’s too late",Annet,"Mon,09/20/2021-8:46pm","First of all, congratulations for being in recovery for several years. That takes a lot of hard work and strength.
Secondly, I think it is a good signal that you are aware of what's going on with your body. In some way, your hunger cues are out of tune with your body. But it seems, you are pretty aware of the changes in your metabolism. Somehow, you ""feel"" your body.I also damaged my endocrine system, my thyroid gland, in particular. I jump from hyperthyroidism to hypothyroidism and that really drives me crazy. On the one hand, due to all the hormone and mood related changes and on the other one, due to all the implications a crazy thyroid gland may bring with it.Congratulations on starting treatment. After some time, your hormone levels and your metabolism will work as expected. That is a good thing. Do not worry too much about the changes in your body. They happen, it is true. But we have damaged our body so much, that changes do not happen in the way we think they will.Think of you rescuing your body, getting it to a better a place and you also feeling better to enjoy life. Your bones are important. Your health is important. You are important. Take care of yourself.Hugs

29,09/19/2021,Don’tFeelSupported,j.neive,"Hi everyone,
I’ve had some issues come up today which led me to come to this forum to talk to others. I have had past eating problems and had finally gotten better over the last couple years, but lately I’ve been falling back into them and had even worse body image issues. I’ve started to be more restricting and today I told my boyfriend I was hungry so we went to see what we could make. After I said I don’t want anything I’ll just eat later he got mad. He started to say that I’m making it his problem and adding on stress he doesn’t need and that I’m being rude and mean. I’m not trying to in any way I’m just struggling a lot. He wasn’t like this before, when we first started dating he would just try and be helpful and nice to make sure I’m having enough, but now he’s totally different. I asked him can we talk about it and can you explain how I’m being mean just because I don’t understand and I want to see where he is coming from. He said no I don’t want to talk about it. He told me that he isn’t going to try and help me or make any food for me anymore if I’m going to be difficult like this. I’m not trying to cause a problem and I told him that but I guess he just doesn’t really care? I don’t know I just wanted to talk to others who understand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,09/20/2021,Hello!,tryingtobebrave,"It’s been quite a while since I’ve been on this forum. I had been doing really well with my recovery. For those of you who weren’t around a couple years ago, I started recovery and I had been waiting two years for jaw surgery to fix severe chronic facial pain. Well, I had done really well in recovery for a year. On April 6th, I got my jaw surgery. I had recurrent infections antibiotics couldn’t fix for months. I had constant wound debridements, the pain and intensity of which traumatized me every time. It felt absolutely hopeless. I had to be on a liquid diet for six weeks because of the surgery, and I had seen and planned with my dietitian prior. I was barely consuming half of what was needed, I just felt hopeless and gave up a bit. Except my surgeon and the nurses wouldn’t let me give up, they kept pushing and advocating until I got in about three weeks ago to see an infectious disease specialist. He diagnosed me with osteomyelitis (severe bone infection, likely started off as staph from the hospital), and I had a picc line inserted. I give myself daily IV antibiotics. I feel like my body has been wrecked and when im finished with the picc line next month, after one more minor jaw procedure, I’m being referred to physical therapy.
So I'm able to eat all foods because my braces are off and I'm healed enough. This is my third week of it. My dietitian has me having a serving of a certain type of sweet everyday for two weeks because this is something that I always felt out of control with. And I am so frustrated because after a full week I still cannot stick with a serving, having three times that amount. I’m not purging because this whole ordeal has made me terrified of infection, and that fear is much stronger than the fear of binging and weight gain. Also; I had to go on and off opioid for short periods of time during this and as a recovering addict, it took a mental toll. Binging is a replacement… until I feel awful afterward. I’m going to do my best to get recovery back on track. But I just want everyone here to know that even after long times of recovery, traumatic or life situations come up and you slip down hill sometimes. But I promise it doesn’t mean this is impossible. I know I’ll get there if I keep at it. One day at a time, and the days do add up. I believe in all of you.",recoveryj,"Mon,09/20/2021-7:41am","Wow; I can’t even begin to express how amazing and inspirational this post is. You are truly such a strong and incredible person. I remember when you first started posting a couple of years back, and seeing how far you’ve made it makes my heart sing. You have so much more light and hope in your life. I’m so glad to hear you finally got the jaw surgery and are almost done with the procedures. Please don’t be hard on yourself if you’re struggling with certain foods. And amazing that you are not resorting to behaviors! That can be so difficult at times, especially when things feel out of control. Maybe you could talk to your dietician about wanting a little more of that food right now? Sometimes I find that the more rules we have around food, the more our bodies and minds want it. Maybe easing those up a bit may actually end up having a more neutral effect!
Regardless though, you are amazing and so, so strong. I hope you keep moving forward and see brighter days ahead
Sending love",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,09/13/2021,quittingrecovery,kcporter6,"It might be a little premature to say I am fully recovered, but I’ve made a lot of progress. I’ve been weight restored and behavior free for a while and I’ve stopped obsessing so much over food recently. I’m almost back to normal. But that’s the problem. I am in an almost identical place to where I was before I developed an eating disorder. And I really do appreciate that food doesn’t rule my life anymore, all I can do is romanticize that part of my life. I don’t like my life, and I don’t have a purpose anymore. When I was in my eating disorder, I had a purpose: make the number on the scale go down, work down to the bone until you cannot physically do so anymore. And that’s what ended up jumpstarting my recovery. I couldn’t work anymore, I couldn’t move, I couldn’t do anything without being riddled with anxiety and exhaustion.

And you can find love, attention, and authentic connection without it. In fact, you’ll be able to find authentic care and connection. EDs keep us isolated.

It was painful to open my jaw, which made it nearly impossible to fit food into my mouth. Because of that procedure, I lost weight in just two weeks. Before my surgery, I was in a really healthy place mentally and physically. It's been just over a year since recovery and I hadn't looked back in a long time. Losing weight rapidly and unintentionally feels like the best thing that's ever happened to me, even though I know it shouldn't. I can eat normally now and every time I eat a meal and reach that point of satisfaction, I hate it. I want to lose more weight. I'm constantly in fear of gaining the pounds back and I'm starting to revert back to my old thoughts. I feel the need to walk off the calories from my dinner every night and it's causing me to fall behind in school. I've just started university in a new state which is hours away from home. I'm scared to tell my family about my ED concerns because I know my mom will worry and it'll keep her up at night.

I've been all over the place since, yet somehow she hasn't caught on. Just the other day she was going on and on about how proud she is and how great I'm doing taking care of myself.

35,08/22/2021,Triggeredbypartner,emily89,"Hi everyone, it's my first time posting on here so hello! I'm looking for some advice/shared experiences. Here's some context: I developed anorexia in my early 20s and suffered with it on and off for around 10 years (the vast majority of these years I'd say I was in semi-recovery: at a low weight and over-exercising but not intentionally starving myself). At the end of 2019, for various reasons, I decided I needed to change something and sought therapy, allowed myself to eat unconditionally and reached a healthy weight (and appetite level) that I've maintained for over a year now. I don't have any food rules and have been successfully practicing intuitive eating and have seen all the mental and physical benefits of proper recovery as a result. This isn't to say it's been easy, as you'll all know, there are good days and bad days but, generally speaking, I'm doing pretty well.However, recently I've started to get really triggered by my partner. We've been together for seven years and for the vast majority of that time, he's had a really healthy and balanced relationship with food. Over the last year or so, that's changed slightly and he's doing lots of research into strict plant-based diets (like, literally just plants), wants to do a juice fast to 'detox' and has also lost a significant amount of weight. It doesn't seem to be obsessive and he says his reasons are getting closer to nature and becoming more in tune with his body and he is of very sound mind. It's also worth noting that while his diet has changed, he does still incorporate most food groups (so it's not just plants... yet). As the closest person to him, who has history of an ED, I'm finding this all very hard to be around. I compare my food intake with his, feel really angry and upset when he talks about it, and question whether I can even be in a relationship with someone who is going down this road. At the same time, I know I can't rely on anyone else to validate my ongoing recovery and everyone's bodies and needs are different. I also think about this in terms of addiction (which I think EDs have components of): would someone who has substance abuse issues, for example, be able to be in a relationship with someone who is a heavy drinker/drug-taker? I suspect not. This makes me wonder whether someone with history of an ED can be in a relationship with someone who seems to be going down the diet culture track.Has anyone had any experience of this? It's a really tricky one for me because all the other aspects of my partner are wonderful: he's kind, caring, gentle, has similar values and principles to mine and I know he'd be a great father (we are hoping to have children in future). It's just that this one thing feels like a big deal to me at the moment and I'm not sure how to move past it (or if I can). Any advice would be massively appreciated!",Aloneinthis,"Wed,08/25/2021-11:05am","Hi! I have a lot of thoughts on this subject…Does your partner know about your ED history? Does he know that these conversations are triggering to you? Obviously, since I’m in this forum, I too have a history of EDs. My husband didn’t know about my ED until my therapist broke confidentiality and called home and told him about it. It wasn’t until then that I could open up with my husband about the ED (side note, I absolutely no not condone violating confidentiality laws in any way shape or form). I was able to tell him when I felt triggered and when his comments were unhelpful and at times hurtful. There are a couple of my coworkers who know about my history with ED. I hate that they think because I know how to lose weight they can come to me with their diet concerns and tell me about their current fad diet. It is incredibly triggering to me and sometimes I try to shut it down with passive aggressive comments. I’m not good at confrontations, but sometimes I feel like it would be better to just come out and say that I’m struggling with the comments and I cannot handle any more fat phobic talk. To answer your question, can you be in a relationship with someone who is on a diet, I believe the answer is probably. Only if you have a conversation with him about your eating disorder and that you’re nervous his change in lifestyle might be detrimental to you.",EphWhyEye,"Tue,09/07/2021-12:21am","In my experience, my husband was only triggering when I was already having a hard time. Then I focused my energy on HIM to pass off the blame. When I am thriving, having the good day, I am not phased by him. I am anorexic/bulimic in/out of recovery and with past alcohol abuse. My spouse was definitely not a healthy eater most of the time and a drinker who works in that industry. When my mental health is tame, I can sit at a bar with him and not be phased. When my anxiety and depression peak, I can smell the drink on him from across the room and start to spin. I haven't drank in almost 9 years because of ME and my actions not HIM and my reactions. As he has gotten older he has tried to improve diet. It is beyond upsetting the days I somehow eat more than him. But I have to remind myself he isn't doing it to spite me and what he does is unrelated to me and my health and recovery. There were plenty of times I struggled through him eating X foods that I wanted to binge on but then being perfectly fine around him eating the same foods other times. Again, it comes down to me and my stability. He is a grown man and I have no control over him. I can only work on me and how I react to the triggering situations.",emily89,"Mon,09/13/2021-11:45am","Thank you both for your really helpful comments. Yes, my partner knows about my history but he can be a bit dismissive (which I think is just due to a lack of understanding). I have ruled out the diet conversation with him and we've agreed not to talk about it but it's difficult being around his behaviours. I can't help but compare my food intake to his and see it as a lot greater (if we spend the day together, I'm often eating lunch on my own, for example) and feel bad about it. But I also know this is conditioning and everyone's body and appetite is different and all I can do is honour mine. It's just hard to really internalise that sometimes.I also agree that I'm more triggered when I'm feeling vulnerable. This is a change that's happened recently so I'm getting used to navigating it and I do think that in the past, I have used his food intake (which was always healthy and significant) as a crutch to justify mine, which I know isn't healthy. This is all exacerbated at the moment because I'm newly pregnant and STARVING very often! It's an interesting and challenging point in recovery when your behaviours have gone but the thoughts still haunt you.",EphWhyEye,"Mon,09/13/2021-11:28pm","Congratulations! How exciting and probably terrifying. You are entering a wonderful (and challenging) journey. I wish you all the best!
Part of me wishes I experienced one pregnancy without an ED. I imagine it is an entirely different journey. I feel the focus was always on my weight and not on the baby's development. My first pregnancy, my doctor was so afraid I wouldn't gain weight. She made me think my body couldn't gain so I over compensated. I ate all the time even when I wasn't hungry. Baby was big and healthy but I ended up with a bunch of extra weight afterwards. I kept some of it on for a year before I finally snapped. My second pregnancy the doctors gave me the whole speech again. I wasn't as anxious about it though. I followed my body cues the best I probably ever have. Some days I ate a bunch, other days  not. My doctor kept insisting I needed to gain more and my baby would be small. Nope. Another big, healthy baby and I didn't have any extra weight. It was like mom mode took over and was listening to baby. I wish I had that connection to my body again. To feel hunger and feed myself without over thinking it and to stop as soon as I was satisfied.",emily89,"Tue,09/14/2021-7:15am","Really glad to hear you were able to find that intuitive balance in your second pregnancy. That's where I feel I'm at – I've been practicing intuitive eating for a year and a half now and can't not listen to my body cues! I'm finding they are especially pronounced during pregnancy so that's what I'm continuing to tune into, rather than any outside sources. Pregnancy, appetite and weight gain is such a personal journey and everyone's experience will be different, which is why professional advice can sometimes be unhelpful (even if it's coming from a good place).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,09/09/2021,"NotBeingknownas""sick""",itsmee,"I recently moved to a new school, (not necessarily new people, because I went to middle school with a lot of the kids here) but no one knows about my eating disorder. I still am not super comfortable talking about it,and on the outside, no one would assume I was still struggling with an ED, because I'm in a better spot than in the past. The thing is, is that part of me wants to look ""sick"" even though I understand that ""sick"" is not a look. Not even from a body image perspective, but because I want people to show concern or surprise or empathy, by seeing how little I eat or how my body looks. I don't know if I'm making sense, haha. I was in a convo at school today and kids were talking about rather or not they ate breakfast. I was trying to be pro-recovery, so I said ""I never understand how people don't eat breakfast! I always have!"" What a hypocritte. Ive said things like that often in school to keep me in a recovery mindset, but often times I feel so bad after saying that. I realllly want to say ""Ohhh yeah I actually was very sick with an eating disorder, and I did ------ and ------ and...."" yatatata. I didn't put details in because I dont want to be triggering. But I guess my point is that I feel like I'm known for being this super bubbly girl with a bunch of snacks spilling out of her back pack,and not hard on myself or anything, and while I am a bubbly girl, I feel like I'm still struggling with my ED.

In a way, I kind of miss the attention that came from people stopping to ask if I was okay. I didn't like if they asked if I ate, or if I had and ED. But I liked it when people asked how my day was or if I was struggeling. I didn't help for a mental problem, and when people asked good questions about my mindset instead of ""Why are you so skinny? Or ""Don't you eat lunch?"" I miss people caring about my mental illness. I still struggle everyday, but no one knows. I guess people were more sensitive because they could clearly see I was struggling. I guess I miss that. I know how you feel. I think that you may miss people caring about how you are doing and asking how you are.

That way, you have people around you who know your history without becoming 'the girl with the eating disorder' amongst a wider group of people which can be an unhealthy persona to lean on. Mainly because the ED is not you, and you'll have many wonderful traits that people will love and give you attention for, and having an illness like an ED form part of your identity can help that illness to thrive. It can also be important to refuse to partake in 'diet culture' style chat which you can do covertly (changing the subject, just not taking part in the conversation) as boundaries will protect your recovery. I wonder if part of the reason for this feeling is also because eating disorders tend to be all-encompassing and we lose ourselves when they take hold. So when they start to leave, you're left with a lot of empty space that you have to learn how to fill again with healthy replacements. If that's relatable, trust that you'll find those replacements in time, be open to new experiences and give yourself grace as you take as much time as you need to adjust to this new healthy and brilliant person you're growing into!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,09/12/2021,Snackingcontrol,yvist_,"I have been in AN recovery for months and can confidently say that I am very close to healthy and normal eating, as well as food freedom. There is only one thing that has been bothering me.Ever since I started my recovery, I have been having difficulties in controlling my snack portions. Almost every time I have to finish the whole pack of snack to stop. I tried to stop amid, district myself, find replacement, all did not work out. I did snack before AN but I always stopped naturally. Yet, I feel like I lost that ability/ power now...Anyone shares similar experience? What can I do?",emily89,"Sun,09/12/2021-3:07pm","Hey, I think this is really common in recovery and it can be due to your body not feeling properly satiated yet and at its optimal weight (which doesn't have anything to do with a BMI scale — it's personal and only your body knows where it's happy). The only times I've ever felt out of control around any kinds of food (which was often snack-style foods because they tend to be calorie dense, which was what I needed) are times when my body needed to put on weight and I've heard this from other people in recovery, too. Also, sometimes you might need to 'overshoot' after a period of starvation and eventually, your appetite (and often weight) will settle down when your body feels safe. Have you ever looked up Stephanie Buttermore's YouTube videos? The one on the science behind 'all-in' might be helpful as it explains this out of control hunger. Also, Megsy Recovery on YouTube is brilliant — although there were times in her recovery when she had to eat A LOT of food, she never uses the word 'binge' because it was just what she needed at the time to feel full. The other thing I'd make sure is that you're eating properly satisfying meals with enough fat, protein and carbs to keep you satiated, which you might find leads you to snack less (although not if your body needs to put on more weight). It's hard to understand what proper nutrition looks like following an eating disorder because your perception of portion sizes and what consists of a meal has been so skewed for so long. This is where a nutritionist can help (if you haven't already got one) or, if you can't afford one, there are lots of people online who post pictures/videos of meals to offer inspiration (my favourites for inspo and info on Instagram are bodybybreakfast, nutritionrewired and dietiticiandeanna). The most important thing I think is not to beat yourself up about it but become curious about why it might be happening, instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anyways, I ended up having four days of purging again.I know I need to stop this immediately so it becomes simply a slip up and not a full blown relapse that I can't shake again.

39,09/10/2021,Specializeddietbringsmorefocustofood,EphWhyEye,"I'm feeling overwhelmed. After years of digestive issues I was finally referred to GI doctor. today he confirmed IBS-C and GERD which each bring their own lists of do/don't foods. Some do foods on one list are don't foods on the other list. I've already been on a low sodium diet for 10 years due to chronic liver disease. Then I have my ED safe/unsafe foods. I feel like this is all too much focus on food when I'm trying so hard to break the obsessive thoughts about food. I just want to eat when hungry without having to be concerned with what and how much. Apparently that will never happen when I have to watch my diet so closely. Both my liver doctor and the new GI doctor are aware of my ED and acknowledge it has been a factor in my health deterioration. However, neither has helped me figure out how every aspect of recovery and maintaing health coexist.
My next step is to call a dietician tomorrow because I don't think I can sort through this mess alone. I'm already anticipating the backlash from people in my life when I cut out more foods. I already get so much grief when I don't eat like others. When I say 'I can't eat that', people ask if I really have stomach issues or if it's just in my head. Both. I know sometimes I used my low sodium diet as an excuse to get out of eating in situations that I wasn't comfortable from an ED standpoint. But I do have legit health conditions that will worsen if I don't follow recommendations.
Anybody have experience with diet restrictions from health issues besides ED? How do you balance recovery and prevent guidelines from becoming problematic?",recoveryj,"Sat,09/11/2021-7:48am","I’m really sorry to hear all of this. Dietary restrictions can complicate recovery so much! Especially because sometimes it is difficult to find the line between what’s our ED and what’s actually something that’s making us sick.
Definitely find a dietician who specializes in eating disorders! During my recovery, I had to go through some specific diets because of all the damage ED did to my body, and my ED dietician really helped me navigate that while still making sure I could get enough nutrition and meet my recovery needs. Also, please don’t lose hope. Bodies change. In my experience, as some of the damage from ED finally began to heal, I found that slowly incorporating certain foods back into my diet didn’t hurt anymore. Sometimes our bodies just need a little extra attention and care. And that’s okay. Even if you do always have to be careful around some foods, that’s okay too. Find things that you like, that nourish you, and that feel good. You can still eat and feed your body and learn how to respond to its needs.

41,08/20/2021,SameOldRoutine,Miggi,"I have been recovered for a year now. But, I am still left with a lot of grief and bad habits. I have a certain weight number I don't want to go over, and I will usually be really restrictive if I ever go over it. Well, it went way far beyond it and now my mind is in shreds. And all I want to do is restrict, but I am just starting a fall sport right now and I know if I do that I won't have energy, and this sport has been making me really hungry, which makes me eat and thats the last thing I feel I deserve. I have been doing this same routine lately. Eat a lot of food because i'm really hungry, feel really guilty and reflect a lot on how much weight i've gained, skip a meal or two, and then do it again after 2 days. I can't seem to break it. I just want to restrict, but then I get hungry and I go to my sport and when I get home.. well the cycle continues. I just want to have a healthy relationship with food and eat to maintain and maybe lose a little. This is all so frustrating and I hate losing control of myself and eating so much.",recoveryj,"Sat,08/21/2021-6:39am","I think it’s time you reflect on what that number means to you. Why is it so distressing to go over when you know you’re giving your body what it needs? It is likely, especially considering you’ve started your sport, that you’ve been gaining muscle! What does that number mean to you, and why are you letting a number, that really means nothing, to dictate the care you show yourself and your body? You know you’re so much more than your relationship with gravity. And that weight fluctuates every day; it fluctuates throughout the day! I’d say it’s high-time to ditch that scale and that dreaded number. Allow your body to land where it’s healthy and comfortable and you have the energy to do what you want to do!
You are worthy of food. Period. End of story. Didn’t work out today? Okay; you’re still worthy of food. All you did was rest? Perfect. Still worthy of food. You always deserve to eat.

42,08/17/2021,Familyfood,Miimi,"A year from now i started getting Picky with food and excercise.
I was already kinda thin back then.not because of any e.d but because of metabolism instead.
The moment i started excersicing and being Picky about food i started loosing weight and obsessing over food.
My family noticed and to make a long story short I need to gain weight.
I have no problem with most of the food but now Im on vacation with my family.
They eat this type of food every day and a lot of fear foods and it leaves me feeling like crap after every meal
I dont wanna make them feel like its still an issue, but their meal choices are awful for me
Any advice on how to stop feeling like this?",hjrichey,"Fri,09/03/2021-2:34pm","Hey!!So first off I want to ask you... When you say eating this stuff makes you feel like crap after every meal, do you mean physically or mentally/emotionally?Physically - If it's physically making you sick, I would first start off by consulting your doctor or dietician and finding out why its making you feel like this, maybe get on a meal plan that will better suit your body in recovery.Mentally - If it's mentally/emotionally then something that I used to do that helped me was instead of focusing on the food itself (calories, fats, etc.) I instead focused on my senses with the food (How it tastes, how it smells, how it looks) and eventually after a while my brain slowly started redirecting itself, plus the more descriptive, the better. If you start to panic over meals just breathe and take your time. Don't let anyone rush you. This itself will take time just like recovery.

However, over the course of my ED, I have realized that the ED thoughts have become less and less as I recover.
Before, 100% of my day was spent on ED thoughts. Nowadays, I think, I do not think of food and calories too often... Maybe just 5 or 10% of my day?So, therapy helps to reduce the frequency of those ED thoughts and as time goes by, you will completely get rid of them. It does not mean they will never come back. That may happen every once and then or when you are passing through a difficult situation.Think of the flu. You get it sometimes. But most of the year you are flu-symptom-free.Cheers
Annet",hjrichey,"Fri,09/03/2021-2:25pm","Hello!So first off I wanted to say that when I first had my eating disorder I was also told something like this... Really I was. But now I've been recovered for 7 years and don't think about ED anymore!Something that helped me was redirecting my thought patterns whenever thoughts would arise, so instead of focusing on the thoughts in my head I might sing my favorite song, maybe even play out fun scenarios in my head until I've calmed down. Then I'll think through my problem rationally. Eventually those thought patterns just stopped playing in my head because my brain retaught itself that when those thoughts even begin to arise, think of something else. If I ever started to panic due to these thoughts, I would simply take as many breaths as needed until I calmed down, then I'd start singing my favorite songs again. There's no rush to deal with your thoughts and recovery is possible. Just have faith in yourself, and take your time.

I know not everyone has a family to go to but if you do, try talking to them about what is going on. You could also try talking to any friends you have. You don’t necessarily have to disclose about your treatment or depression, but just asking to have dinner or calling to see how they are, might bring something positive into your day.

I will say, in my experience, that feeling did go along with time, aided by a development of strong social support at home. As I a developed confidence in my ability to cope (celebrating small successes, using affirmations, being open with trusted others, treatment compliance, etc.), I really became comfortable standing on my own two feet.

It is hard, and I think the reason transitioning back into everyday life is so hard is because in rehab you only have to focus on yourself, which is nice in a world where you have to focus on everything around you, but when you're discharged you're just kind of dropped into the real world and have to try and pick up where you left off... It's hard and very frustrating. Coming out of recovery, try not to push too much on yourself all at once. You're still healing. Once a week, or even once a day, just set aside some time and focus on you. Think about YOUR needs, not what work is requiring or softball, but what YOU need.For the constant support, I reached out to all of the friends I made in rehab and started communicating with them again!! It was a great way to kind of transition back into the real world with people who knew exactly how I felt!! Facebook support groups can also be very beneficial too!Praying for you during this time and I hope this helps!""Don't be afraid for I am with you, don't be discouraged for I am your God.

Often, both can be caused by trauma or chronic stress, which can be either physical, mental, emotional, or a combination of each. Both chronic pain and eating disorders are directly related to the neurological system. In the autonomic nervous system, there are two branches: the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) and the parasympathetic nervous system (rest, digest, restore). When we experience trauma or stress, out sympathetic nervous system goes into hyperdrive and the parasympathetic system take a back seat. As a result, we are put in more of a survival mode and our bodies are not given the opportunity to heal and restore themselves. The rise in the sympathetic nervous system also leads to increased muscular tension, decreased digestive health, decreased tissue repair, increased inflammation, and many other compromising conditions.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,09/02/2021-2:17pm","Hi KellyKessler!

I am practically recovered but my body is still not back to normal.
It is pretty frustrating because we all expect that with recovery everything becomes perfect and to our surprise, several of the physical symptoms still continue.I also have problems with my muscles and joints. I am always in pain. The thing is doctors do not find anything wrong with me. The more they do is to send me to physical therapy that does not resolve the problem either.My personal take is that pain will go and our body will heal over time. How much time? It will depend on the damage done. It may also happen that some damage is not reversed in which case, we will and we need to learn to accept our current body.Cheers with this.

Not only are lapses and relapses really common in the ED community, but with all that’s been going on, a lot of us have been slipping some in recovery. You are not alone.
That said, EDs thrive on secrecy and isolation. One of the most important things you can do is be open with people who support you. Do you have a team you work with such as an ED dietician or therapist? I highly recommend getting in contact with them or finding someone if you don’t. It takes so much strength to acknowledge that you may be slipping, so you’ve already taken a huge first step. It’s not to late to catch this before it gets even worse. Remember to lean on those who care about and support you. It’s okay to not be okay. It’s okay to need help. And it’s okay to seek outside help too. Maybe getting back in contact with an ED dietician and therapist would be the best route right now. Often, they can help us get back on our feet after a lapse. You don’t have to let this fall any farther. You can do this. And you deserve the help. You are worth it",emmaa,"Fri,08/27/2021-3:00am",Thank you it feels good to know that this is quite normal and that actually takes a part of the guilt away.

I’m so glad to hear you have a therapist you can reach out to. I would highly recommend opening up to her about this. EDs thrive on secrecy - it seems like the more we keep to ourselves, the worse it gets. You deserve to have people on your team supporting you. You got through this once; you can do it again. Even if it looks different this time, you are not alone. And you deserve care and nourishment; to be free of ED. It’s okay to need extra help to. That’s just part of being human.

I am in a very similar position. I was considered recovered for a few years, but with life stressors I have fallen back into old Ed behaviors. Along with COVID, I have some family issues that are taking a toll on my stress level. It’s so easy to fall back into old habits because we know they help to numb the pain/stress. We also know these behaviors are not helping to solve any problems, they are only contributing to the problem and creating new problems. However, I also know it is comforting to go back to familiar coping tools that aren’t helpful in the long run. I too am unable to reach out to family and friends about my struggles. I hated it last time when I felt like my every movement was being watched, that every bite was being scrutinized, that every bathroom break was being assessed. I don’t want to feel policed around food either. It’s frustrating when every minute of every day is consumed by food and calorie counting and obsessing. I don’t have any answers for you except, know that you are not alone in feeling this way. I have reached out to a therapist and have been seeing him for a few months now, but it’s still difficult when there’s not a lot of real time help out there the moments you need it the most.",emmaa,"Fri,08/27/2021-3:04am",hey! sorry that u are going through that and thank u for sharing that.

I am an 18 year old girl from Germany. I struggle with binging and purging fsince about 2018 while also doing competitive swimming. I am attempting recovery since about February/March. The past six weeks I was home for vacation where I had no chance to continue my ED like behaviors. Since the start of this week I am at my school again and have to live alone. I find it really difficult to keep up what I managed the past six weeks at home and today I just couldn't which is why I searched for a forum like this. While I go to a therapist and are getting help that way I find it hard to talk to my friends or mother about this problem so I am looking for people who can understand better how hard it can be to try and break a really bad habit. I am struggeling a lot right now and find my self thinking about food the whole day. My biggest problem is that I just don't know anymore how much I really have to eat in order to function and make it through training.

I am also new to this whole side and I wanted to connect with you after reading your post. I am a 29 year old female from the US. I struggled with eating disorder behaviors and body image issues for around 10 years. I grew up as a dancer, and I developed late in life. Living in minimal form fitting garments, like a leotard for me, next to girls with what i viewed as perfect bodies and an internal pressure I had to be perfect lead to me binge and purge, restrict myself, and over exercise through different periods of time in life. When you say your transition to being alone has been difficult, I want you to know I feel that. I find that when I am isolated and alone I can easily slip back into unhealthy thought patterns and behaviors. I too am in therapy, and I too do not talk to my mother about my true struggles and experiences. I have a very loving and supportive boyfriend that I am open with, but it is different than connecting with someone who lives this every day. I know what its like to live every day thinking of food and how much and what and when. I do not know what is best for you or most healthy, but I can encourage you to work on not punishing yourself. For anything. Because our bodies and food and eating are things we should care about. I encourage you to be open with you therapist about needing guidance right now. Something that helps me is asking myself ""would I punish my best friend for eating this? would I tell my best friend don't eat that?"" for me the answer is no and I have to view myself as my body is my best friend and I want you to know you are worthy of the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve experienced the same sensation. I was just talking about it today with my therapist and she gave me some helpful insight.

Before I share my therapists response, to preface, she is very straightforward. But she suggested I stop waiting for the energy to come to me because it wasn’t going to. Instead, she said to do things I enjoy knowing it will help me feel better and result in me having more energy.

56,08/06/2021,Emotionallydrainedaftertherapy,Aloneinthis,"Hi! I have been struggling with major Ed behaviors lately and it’s been going on for a while. When I started going back to a (new to me) therapist, the behaviors worsened instead of getting better. I think this happened because I was able to tell someone about the Ed symptoms and was able to put it in his court. Like I wasn’t responsible because someone else knew and I could continue and even add bad Ed behaviors. And, because Ed is sneaky and wants to stay, behaviors got much worse. I have also been struggling with being open in therapy with my new therapist. If he didn’t ask the questions, I didn’t give the answers. I am super proud of myself for actually being open during this last session. For some reason it’s not as difficult to talk about the restricting. I feel like I’m more in control when I’m restricting and able to keep calories at a minimum. But, when the calories increase and I feel like it’s too much, I will make myself sick. I have always had difficulty telling anyone this and I don’t like to talk about it. I think it’s because I feel out of control when that happens. I like having control and when I eat too much, I feel out of control and then the purging leaves me feeling totally out of control. Not really sure why I came here and posted, I just needed to get decompress after an emotionally draining session. I feel good that I was able to talk about the purging, but also out of control at the same time. Has anyone else felt like this?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,07/23/2021,Recovered?,sei_s,"Hi, I just joined the forums, so this is my first post here.I've had an eating disorder since November of 2018 (beginning of high school), and I was ""outed"" by my parents and started recovery around the spring of 2019. I gained weight for about a year after that, after which point my physical health was basically restored...except for the fact that I still don't have a regular period. But my weight is stable. Part of that is because I'm still somewhat restrictive—but that leads to overeating/bingeing occasionally, so I think my body is naturally balancing it out.As for ED behavior and food/body anxiety, it's gradually lessened over the past years to the point where I can more or less eat and function normally. I've also had more energy to explore other hobbies like writing and playing music, as well as hanging out with friends. But certain habits like calorie counting still take up a fair amount of brainspace.85~90% of the time I feel genuinely fine. But still...no regular period, constant calorie-counting.I'm not sure what to think. Am I recovered, or even mostly recovered? Is the solution still just to eat more, or is there something else that I'm missing?",Annet,"Mon,07/26/2021-5:32pm","I think you are still not 100% recovered.

So, if you can get some professional help that could help you to completely get rid of these issues.Congratulations on all the progress done. Great work!
Now, do not stay in that pseudo_recovery state and look forward getting completely recovered and ED-free!Remember that the longer you stay with your ED, the more difficult it becomes to get rid of it.

Soon after writing the first post, I tried to stop counting calories for the first time!...and quickly realized that I can't just switch it off. It's as if calorie-counting has been wired into my brain, and making food decisions without considering calories is very anxiety-inducing. On top of that, the idea and sensation of gaining body fat is as distressing as ever. Which more or less proves your point, I think. I wasn't recovered, I just stopped trying.Regardless, allowing myself (at least rationally) to eat as much as I need and want regardless of calories is a wonderful feeling (at least before the anxiety catches up with me).All in all...as hard as it is to make a consistent effort, I know now that I have to keep trying.

Not sure if that caused ED thoughts to be stronger or if I just couldn't take it with everything happening at the time. I just feel fat and feel guilty about eating and what I'm eating and I worry if I'm eating too much, and I recently had this moment of complete repulsion about my body (which spurred me to start looking for people to talk to). I just don't want to talk about it with people in my life, even if they are very dear to me. I don't know why, but I feel a lot freer knowing that what I say here will be understood. I don't have to worry about explaining or about getting someone's pity without their comprehension. And there's some part of my mind that worries that they'll say something that will make me worse. I know that they've changed and learned a lot since I first started struggling with ED, and I know they have my best interests at heart. It happened before, and I haven't forgotten that.I'm going to get better. Progress isn't linear, after all. I just have to have faith that something will change and I'll start feeling better again. Maybe there's even something I could do to facilitate that. Do you have any tips?",Annet,"Tue,07/20/2021-11:49pm","Progress not perfection... People with eating disorders tend to strive for perfection. However: nobody is perfect and no body is perfect.Recovery has many stages. There is a point in recovery where you live freely from your ED and just get ED thoughts every once and then.For some of us that happens when life gets hard, when we are stressed, tired or simply bored.
What I usually do is to ask myself what's happening in my life that I am needing my eating disorder to numb those feelings/emotions/sensations.
Often, I realize something hard or difficult is happening...Will you start feeling better again? For sure!
You keep going, ignore those ED thoughts. The less importance you give to them and the least time you dedicate to them, the sooner they will be away.
Because if you start listening to what your ED wants to tell you, you may end up acting on behaviours. So, keep yourself away from those ED thoughts. Ignore them but try to identify why they are coming back.Hugs

Welcome to the forums. When reading your post, I completely identified with you. I have struggled most of my life with some sort of eating disorder. I will have some periods with little Ed thoughts and behaviors, but then something happens and I always go back to the safety of Ed. If I eat too intuitively, I feel like I’m gaining too much weight and I’ll look in the mirror and feel disgusted…and then cue the Ed thoughts and behaviors. I recently started working with a new therapist and I’ll do better for a few days after our session, but then I’ll go back to the Ed. I too have apprehension about sharing my thoughts and behaviors related to Ed because of similar reasons. I know before I was treated differently when people around me knew about what was going on, and some while well-intentioned, weren’t always the best at helping to quiet the Ed voices. A lot of my thinking is jaded when I’m in full on restricting mode. Comments that were meant to be helpful or even trying to make light of the situation just dug me deeper into the hole of Ed. Most people have no idea what it’s like to live in constant fear of gaining a single ounce and how it ruins your entire day or how it’s nearly impossible function when food is involved (and let’s face it, food is involved in nearly every outing, family/friend/work function). It becomes paralyzing. We both know that giving into the ed voice isn’t the answer, but it’s so comforting to know it’s there to be able to numb what’s going on. I wish I knew how to quiet the Ed voices. You can do it and so can I. Remember what you said…progress isn’t always linear, it’s important to keep fighting and trying!",Tryingtoheal,"Tue,07/20/2021-7:55am","Never got treatment until 2016.  My mom never thought I had an eating disorder. So far, I think I've had passing thoughts of eating disorder thoughts, but that's normal.  8t is possible to be well.  Eventually you stop living in the eating disorder.  Eventually those loud ED thoughts stop; behaviors stop; self hatred stops or is drastically reduced; and you stop hating your body as well as losing the attraction to and desire to be in the eating disorder

59,06/29/2021,TheFearofBeingOverweightAgain,mavisdrac66,"I thought I’d provide little about my case first. I have never been overweight or underweight. In fact I never knew how much I weighed until I emigrated from my country and arrived here in CA. When I came I was lonely and depressed so I turned to food for comfort, I became overwhelmingly overweight and didn’t care until I was the heaviest one in PE class. I started my “diet” just as Coronavirus pandemic exploded. I started limiting and limiting until I reached almost nothing to eat at all the whole day. My parents and everyone around me started noticing that I was rapidly losing weight but they didn’t try to stop me. I think a part of me stayed consistent with the restriction just to get them to notice how sick and unwell I was. I finally reached my dream weight. But then one day I looked in the mirror and realised that I had no energy to do anything but stay in bed, I lost my sense of life and happiness. That’s when I started considering recovery. I started expanding my intake and eating my fear foods. I remained pretty much the same because I was still in restriction. I later turned to purging for comfort. Then over time as my throat started to hurt I just stopped. I never became underweight though and still no one realised what was wrong. My intake started normalising, and by that I mean to a normal person’s intake. Then I started regaining weight. The fact that I was still at a normal weight but gaining overweight brought me hysteria and anxiety. All I could think of was that I was becoming overweight again. I was never admitted to a hospital or anything but I lost my period and my paediatrician finally mentioned it to my mom “your daughter might be anorexic”. Where I am is starting to be free again. I can’t stop weighing myself though and every time I do, boom, I have gained another pound. I am scared I will turn to restriction again, I don’t want to. I also really need advice on how to stop weighing myself, and if I do, how do I cope with the fact that I might have gained weight and not panic?",lulu601,"Tue,07/06/2021-12:14pm","hi i just read your post and i’m sure it must be very difficult for you right now. for me the only way i stopped weighing myself was making sure that i wasn’t able to. i broke my weight scale and even when i wanted to put new batteries and try and fix it i decided not to. throw your weight scale away and no matter how much you want to weight yourself don’t. if that voice inside your head gets too loud play a game, talk to a friend on the phone, watch your comfort movie, watch funny videos, watch a new drama, read a book do anything but weigh yourself and look in the mirror. distract yourself until that voice loses its power. don’t body check or at least try and stop yourself if you can. understand that weight gain during recovery is crucial and completely normal. for me what helped was buying a books about eating disorders. these two books have helped me so so much. you’ll start to realise how damaging your ed is and feel less at war with your body. just remember weighing yourself never helps. if you’re at a low weight you’ll be anxious that you’ll gain it back. if you haven’t changed you’ll be worried about how to maintain it or be sad that it hasn’t gone lower. if you’re at a higher weight you’ll panic be scared and cry. so weighing yourself never never helps. throw out the weight scale, take out the batteries or break it. i promise it will help so so much. i now don’t really ever get the urges to weigh myself and i promise during the peak of my ed i used to weigh myself every hour.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/07/2021-2:54pm","Hi Lulu601!

I would feel amazing if I did, but I live with my parents and my siblings and they use it too, and believe me they don’t get the issue as it is, imagine if I threw the scale, it’ll complicate their understanding of the problem even more. However, I made it less frequent. It’s natural to be honest. When you start recovering, you naturally get back to things you once loved and you’re just distracted enough that you finally don’t even care to know your weight because you’re happy enough and just don’t wanna ruin it. It’s not about getting rid of the scale, it’s about seeing whatever number is on there, and not even bothering to waste one second of your life thinking about the stupid number.",eviefrye1868,"Tue,07/13/2021-9:59pm","Hi mavisdrac66,I am going through a very similar struggle. I think I may have gained some weight back as per of my recovery and it is really impacting my self esteem. When I was really deep in my ED I couldn’t even take a shower or change my own tampon in a reasonable time frame which is really embarrassing honestly, but it is what it is. I think what helps me to over come my anxiety is doing some deep breathing and remembering just how sad and awful a felt and reaffirming that the ONLY way to not feel that way is to continue my recovery.To be fair I still have relapse days, which can be really normal. I encourage you to talk to family/friends/a trusted adult about what is going on so you can get some of the thoughts out of your head.",mavisdrac66,"Sun,08/01/2021-2:22am","Yes, showering was one thing. At one point I was so preoccupied with my weight that I would be afraid to shower or do anything in fact out of the fear that I might be half a pound heavier later. I weighed myself up to 20 times a day, crying over the slightest fluctuation, believe me decimal fluctuations made me cry. Yet because I never hit the “underweight” zone, I was never taken seriously, I mean my parents knew something was wrong, but you know, they never understood how much of a torture the voices in your head can be when they attack. However, ever since I started regaining some of my weight, and naturally became “ok” with it, I realised how free gaining weight made me feel. It really makes you learn to accept what you can’t change about your healthy self:D",friendlyfox,"Tue,07/27/2021-7:36pm","I completely understand how you are feeling. I too never reached an extremely low weight so no one really noticed except for one of my friends. I am also recovering which has led to a weight increase.

Has anyone else also been experiencing extreme hunger during recovery?",mavisdrac66,"Sun,08/01/2021-2:16am","Yes, in the very beginning, during my first attempt, I was so hungry all the time, and I binged a lot, although unfortunately that later led to purging, I learned that it was completely normal. Our bodies have been malnourished long enough to want a lot of food. It”s like holding your breath for a very long time and then finally taking that deep, deep breath right after. It’s normal to be hungry, you’ll find yourself stabilising later, but for now, I think we should really honour our hunger no matter how much it is, we deserve it, it’s a sign that our body is fighting back alongside us :D",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

61,07/28/2021,RelapseandStomachPain,CrabbyPatty,"So I feel like I'm about to relapse, I've been working out a lot more recently because it's something I genuinely enjoy doing but have been feeling really guilty when that causes me to be more hungry and eat more. I've been getting to urge to fall back into destructive habits because I remember how good I felt and how I actually started to like how I looked when I was at my lowest weight before getting help, despite recognizing that I was not getting the nutrients my body needed. I just don't have any motivation per say to NOT give in, which is something I need to work on. I also have anxiety, which makes me severely nauseous if I forget to take my meds on time, which in turn makes it difficult to eat. On top of all of that I have digestive issues in which my stomach cramps up and gets very bloated and painful when I eat gluten or dairy or sometimes just after I eat for no reason at all, even though my eating disorder is likely the cause of these issues I sometimes feel as if it would be easier not to eat and avoid all the difficult planning and pain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,07/07/2021,WhatIneed,Aloneinthis,"Hi! I am having a difficult time saying what I need. What I need in therapy and just life in general. I am so used to suppressing my feelings in order to make everyone else around me happy. I don’t know how to use my voice to articulate what I need. I recently started going to therapy again. I have been able to open up a little with him about what’s going on, but I have some major life stressors that have pushed me back into eating disordered behaviors. My head knows that EDs do not solve problems and only create more problems. I want to be able to tell my therapist what I need, but I’m embarrassed and ashamed of what I’m doing. I feel like I know better and should be able to do better.At the end of each session, my therapist asks me when he is going to see me again and I give him dates that work for me. This past session, I gave him a date that was two weeks out. I need more than this and I know it. I don’t want to be needy, but I am. After each session with him I am able to quiet the ED voice, but it only lasts a day or two. Then, I’m back to old behaviors. I recently brought out the scale again. I knew it was a bad idea at the beginning, but my therapist didn’t tell me to not weigh myself, so I took it as a green light. I know that was not his intention. I knew it was a bad idea and it’s all on me for bringing it out. I knew where my head was and that the scale was only going to bring up more obsessing about weight and numbers, but I still got it out and stepped on it. I like watching the numbers go down, I like watching my clothes feel more baggy, I like being able to body check. Someone recently said that EDs are my drug of choice and they were right. I don’t like to admit it, but ED is my drug of choice. I like the high I get watching the numbers on the scale go down, I like the high I feel when I am able to restrict. I want to be able to reach out to people in real time in real life about what’s going on, but I’m too ashamed and embarrassed about where I am. I hate all the secrets. I hate lying (and honestly, I suck at it and people see right through the lies). I am scared people will over analyze and will try to push me to eat. Part of me needs this, but I’m not sure I want it. I want to get back to my ED weight and size, but at the same time I don’t want to be in ED hell. I know in my head I can’t have it both ways. It’s either increase my calories or go back to the hell of ED. I’m well on my way there. I’m at a crossroads at the moment and can choose either ED or living a real life. I don’t want this for me and I don’t want my kids to be subjected to the life ED brings. I’m not really sure why I’m posting, but I have so many thoughts and feelings I need to get out and I don’t have anyone I can express them to except for my therapist and I don’t see him for another week.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/07/2021-2:24pm","Hi Aloneinthis, you mentioned wanting to talk to someone in real time, the NEDA helpline and online chat can help you out with that if you like. You can call 800-931- 2237 or chat, https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/helplinechat  to discuss support options.

I saw you mentioned that you were embarrassed and felt shame about some of the things going on. I remember feeling that way too. A lot of people can be driven by shame or guilt, so you are not alone in that feeling. However, I think you made a very important discovery in your message. You recognized you are at a crossroads and how you ""can choose either ED or living a real life"". ED's and recovery are not linear and it is ok to feel pulled in many directions or like it is overwhelming.But I think you being able to recognize that you are frustrated and are at a crossroads, shows that you have the capacity to change.

This is all very overwhelming and I feel so alone through all of it. I’m sorry you also have gone through/are going through this. There is a lot of shame and embarrassment having to navigate an ED midlife. I feel like I’m struggling with something that I should have been able to overcome years ago. I don’t want my kids to see me struggle. I put on a strong front for others to see and I want to be the place my kids come to with their struggles. I am barely holding myself together at the moment. Why are EDs so enticing? Why am I being drawn back to it when I know the hell it brings? I’ve gone through this before and I know that it sucks, so why am I choosing to do this to myself? I know it feels good to be able to put on those skinny jeans and see the numbers drop, but I also know it’s not worth it. I’m scared I am doing damage to my health and I want to be able to be present for my kids. I know that restricting is not healthy. I know that fasting, even intermittent fasting has consequences. I know of all the risks in my healthy brain, but I am having a difficult time choosing to be healthy and feed myself what my body needs. I have the capacity to change. I don’t know if I want to at this point. Part of me says it’s the right thing to do, but the other part is telling me that I began “dieting” this time as a way to drop a few pounds as I had gone into the overweight category and needed to get “healthy”. I have a very much black or white mentality when it comes to foods/eating. Somehow with work I am able to see the gray, but with food, it’s all or none (safe vs unsafe foods, fasting vs binging). I’m trying to tell myself it’s more healthy to be at a healthy weight, but I know myself and I know I’m on a journey that is not healthy. I told myself I would be able to go back to eating “normal” when I lost enough to be in the middle of a normal BMI, but I’m there now and I want to keep going.",eviefrye1868,"Tue,07/13/2021-5:52pm","Something my case manager told me once is that gratitude can be a very good tool to combat negative thoughts and feelings. You seem very concerned about your children and being there for them, maybe keeping a journal about all the good moments you have each day with them can help give you something to look at remember why you want to be healthy. Writing down simple things at the start or end of the day like, I enjoyed seeing my kids smile today,  I am grateful I woke up on time, I am grateful it is sunny out, may help bring some positive feelings back. We live in a really hard world. There are lots of ever changing messages about who we should be/look like being thrown at us, especially in the last 20 years. It’s maybe not so surprisingly then to be in middle age and have these feelings. Besides, mental health has no age limit! I think it’s ok to acknowledge being sick. EDs are known to have addictive qualities. I also sometimes find myself missing certain habits. I don’t think that has to be shameful or embarrassing, even though I have definitely felt that way many many times!!! We have both had EDs for large portions of our lives so it’s hard to get rid of the habits. You are not alone! Again, I know it’s overwhelming, especially at the start phase of the recovery process. I am overwhelmed still some days with similar feelings. But I believe in you, so over time I hope you will also come to believe in yourself.",Aloneinthis,"Thu,07/29/2021-10:10am","Hi! Thank you for your suggestion. I have been trying to voice my “wins” each day. I decided to start each therapy session with going through my wins since the last time we met. It has helped me to be a little more appreciative of what I have going for me. You hit it head on when you said we live in a world that is always throwing us messages about how we should look or what we should eat or even how we should act. It’s a never ending battle competing with others on trying to be the best. While it’s not a bad thing to try and better yourself, it becomes a challenge when a perfectionist is never able to achieve perfection because something can always be done better or someone has already done it better. I have a difficult time dealing with not being able to achieve perfection even though I know it’s not possible. Knowing that I’m headed back down a path of destruction should be terrifying, but part of me is excited to be able to restrict again and lose weight. I was even complimented on my weight loss at the MD office last time even though they are totally aware of my Ed history. Instead of asking questions about how I am going about losing weight, I felt as though I was given a gold star for losing. It gave me the green light to continue to lose. In my head, I know what I’m doing isn’t heathy, but the Ed voices are telling me it’s a good thing to lose weight and I’ll have more confidence and feel better if I just lose a few more pounds. I know it will never be enough, but it’s difficult to not listen to Ed at the moment.",Annet,"Tue,07/13/2021-7:20pm","""Hi! I am having a difficult time saying what I need.

As I’ve matured, I’ve been able to decline graciously, but it’s still not easy. You brought up a very valid point, therapy is an excellent place to practice expressing what I need. I have an appointment tomorrow and I’ve written down some items I would like to discuss. I’m just hoping I have the courage to be able to verbalize them tomorrow. I had a hard time being open and vulnerable. I’ve already made myself vulnerable by opening up to the new therapist about ED. I haven’t been completely open, he hasn’t asked all the questions and I haven’t told. I would very much like to text or email him the list I’ve made, but I feel it’s juvenile to have to do that and that I should be able to verbalize my thoughts face to face.

It took me a while to tell my phychiatrist how I really felt about our relationship and what I needed from her. I will not lie, it was difficult. But once I was able to express it, many things changed.Opening up to your therapist about your ED is the best thing u can do. It can only bring good things to you. I started seeing my current therapist for another issue and in a short therapy model (work only pays for 6 sessions). I had never ever clicked so much with someone and decided to hire her as my therapist for my ED.
Even though I already knew her from my previous 6 sessions related to another issue, the first session where I told her about my ED was hard. I was super nervious and even anxious. My voice was getting broken and my body was shaking.She told me she never imagined I had an eating disorder... I know I am pretty good at hiding it BUT it was my time to be vulnerable and to ask for the help I needed.I had been in treatment before but I had never committed to recovery.It has been 2.5 years that I started with this last try and I am a thousand of times better.So, go ahead and open up to your therapist.

I’m so happy you are able to open up to your psychiatrist. I wish I was able to do the same. I don’t like to be open about things that are difficult with people in real time. When growing up, difficult situations were avoided and not talked about. I still have the mentality that embarrassing or things I find shameful (like Ed) should be boxed up and left to deal with alone. Actually opening up with a therapist is terrifying and hard for me to do. I was able to slowly open up with my old therapist, but I haven’t been with the new one very long. It’s difficult for me to voice my needs. For example, I know I need to have weekly sessions at the moment. I will do well for a couple days after my appointment, but then revert back to restricting. This past appointment he asked me when we were going to meet next and I chose a time a couple weeks away because I don’t want to seem too needy. Then, something came up and I had to change it to yet another week away. I am totally struggling right now. Just like you, it’s so easy to hide, act like everything’s okay when in reality I feel like it’s all falling apart. I feel myself at a breaking point. I deserve better, my family deserves better. Maybe next week I can put it all on the table. Last week, I had written down a list of topics I needed to cover and I didn’t reference that paper once. It’s frustrating, because I know what I need, but the fear of not being the strong, independent, confident person I put out there is paralyzing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

64,07/28/2021,"wantingtorelapse,strugglinganddepression",lulu601,"hi i’m 15 months into my recovery and i believe i’m in the late stages of it because i feel much more comfortable around food, i have a period and my hair loss has completely stopped. however the psychological/emotional symptoms of my anorexia are still present and seem to get worse. i have atypical anorexia and although it was never diagnosed i am 100% sure i do because i have experienced all the symptoms and i completely resonate with it. i tried to get help for my eating disorder and get diagnosed but was denied because i am of a ‘healthy weight’ and i have done most of the recovery work by myself. it’s not the first time i’ve been denied help for my mental health but this time i was completely devastated and felt disgusting. i was so happy about finally receiving help and became a little bit more hopeful about life and recovery. it’s true that i got my period back by myself and i did a lot of the recovery work by myself but i still needed help because i felt very suicidal due to the weight gain and i was still struggling with eating. i cry everyday because of my body and weight gain so it’s clear that i still need help for my eating disorder. i’m always having panic attacks and i’m extremely depressed because of it but the mental health clinic just told me that ‘they didn’t want to make it into a bigger thing than it already is and that i was strong enough to recover by myself’. they also told me to contact them again if i was getting worse but after how they responded to me i don’t think i want to. regardless i’m over that now but i want to relapse because i feel like i don’t deserve to eat or deserve to recover. i’ve already talked about this on neda before but i came across some pro ana accounts on twitter and because of it i hate my body even more and feel like i’m huge and disgusting. i feel even more ashamed of myself and dislike myself even more. seeing how big i am compared to my pre-ed body puts me to shame. i have never been this weight before and it’s terrifying and extremely unfamiliar. i don’t recognise myself anymore and have no confidence at all. i feel extremely insecure and i isolate myself because of it. i don’t go out or try to buy new clothes because of the psychological discomfort. i miss being hungry all the time and i miss being sick. i want to go back to being sick but i will be doing my a levels soon meaning i need to have full energy to study and revise for two years. a levels are big exams that determine what university you will be going to. but because of my eating disorder i have lost interest in going to a good university and don’t have excitement about my future anymore. what’s also stopping me from relapsing is the hair loss. i was always terrified when i would shower because of the huge clumps of hair i’d see fall out. my hair is the only thing i like about myself so i couldn’t bare to see it fall out. i knew i needed to recover. but what shall i do i’m always depressed because of my body and i don’t think i’ll ever return to my pre-ed weight because i still haven’t lost any overshoot. i can’t stand being so huge and i can’t stand my new body. i hate it more than anything. i’m so depressed that i struggle to get out of bed, shower and sleep. i either don’t sleep for over 24 hours sometimes or i sleep too much. i’ve resorted back to self harming again and i keep having suicidal thoughts. my counselling recently stopped but i didn’t feel that my counsellor did much to help me. she would just listen to me talk. i know i need help but i can’t help myself anymore. i can’t bring myself to even call my doctor and book an appointment. whenever i do book appointments i always cancel them last minute because i don’t want anyone to see my body and i don’t have any appropriate clothes to go out. i don’t go out anymore bc of my negative body image and how much i hate my body.my parents can’t even help me because they both don’t believe in eating disorders and they don’t understand mental health issues. other than them i don’t have any other support systems so i’m struggling all alone. my parents are extremely toxic and are the cause of my childhood trauma and most of my mental health issues so i can’t even talk to them about it. i’m scared my friend will judge me if i tell her and i don’t want her to know how i feel either. i feel like i’m a burden and a disappointment. nothing is going right for me at the moment and i’m on the verge of giving up all my recovery even though i worked so hard for it. i hate my recovered body and i know it will probably stay like this forever. i don’t think i’ll ever be able to accept it and seeing how big i am disgusts me and terrifies me. what should i do please give me advice guys. i apologise for all the negativity in what i had to say but it’s truly the way i feel at the moment. i also body check all the time but i haven’t weighed myself in months. unfortunately i saw my weight less than a month ago because of a doctors appointment. i also hate how big my face has gotten and i can see the huge difference compared to my pre-ed body. i know my friends and family have all seen how much weight i’ve gained and i feel so ashamed and embarrassed because of it. i’m always stressed out because of my body and obsessed with fantasising about being thin and skinny. i also want to stop being obsessed with being skinny but i don’t know how to. the uncertainty of whether or not i’ll lose my overshoot weight is also horrible. recovery is so difficult and i’m so angry with my parents for being the main cause of it and my childhood trauma. i used to hate my body before my eating disorder and thought i was huge back then but now i’ve gained so much weight and im so much bigger than how i used to be so you can imagine how distressing it is for me and how much i hate it. i never imagined in my whole life that i would ever be this big or this heavy. like i already said i’ve never been this weight before so it’s horrible for me. as a kid i was always underweight just bc i never had an appetite and growing up i was in the healthy range but now i’m overweight because of recovery and i’m terrified it’ll stay like this forever. i don’t think i’ll be able to cope with being overweight forever and i don’t know what to do because i can’t even try to lose weight or ill be relapsing.if no one replies to this it’s okay because i feel better by venting and letting my feelings out. thanks to anyone who read this far and i’ll be really appreciative if anyone responds. thank you again.",recoveryj,"Wed,07/28/2021-7:52am","My heart is breaking for you; sending so much love and compassion your way. You have worked so hard to get where you are. Eating disorder recovery is difficult enough on its own, but you had to fight through so many things working against you, things you’re still fighting to this day! I can’t even imagine how exhausted you must feel. The fact that you’ve gotten here is incredible and speaks to your amazing strength. You can overcome.
That said, I got so angry when I heard about the practitioners’ response to you. They completely invalidated your entire experience! Honestly, what they did is absolutely malpractice. They should not be working in this profession. An eating disorder is an eating disorder. Period. End of story. If they are basing diagnoses on bodies, they likely have many more patients that don’t receive adequate (or any) care. And that, that is what is disgusting. Good for you for being your own advocate, fighting for recovery, and realizing how messed up those doctors are. You deserve so much better. The discrimination in health care and the lack of knowledge among practitioners is truly horrifying.
I know you probably already know this, but please try to remember BMI means nothing. It is NOT a measurement of health. And even if it were, the statistics that make it were based ONLY on white, heterosexual, European men. And a fairly small sample at that! And the person who made it was a mathematician, NOT a doctor. It means nothing. Even if you’re a “healthy weight”, that doesn’t mean you or your body are well. Additionally, it’s completely arbitrary - the US actually lowered the cut-offs for “overweight” so they could charge people more money for insurance. It means nothing, and number can never define you.
You are so strong and courageous. You deserve help and support. You don’t have to fight this on your own. I’m so sorry it’s so hard right now to be in your body. I can definitely resonate with those feelings. Have you thought about finding a therapist somewhere else? Someone who specializes in eating disorders? I would HIGHLY recommend seeking out people who are trained in/familiar with the HAED (health at every size) approach.  You deserve to live your recovered life enjoying being in your body and all the things you can do with your amazing strength. Know you are never alone. You are so loved and cared for. And you deserve to recover.
Recoveryj",lulu601,"Wed,07/28/2021-9:27am","thank you so much recoveryj for taking the time out of your day to read my comment and respond to me. thank you so so much for all the beautiful things you said and empathising with me, i have never heard these words before or been empathised with this much so i am truly so thankful towards you. your comment truly brought tears to my eyes and it’s so unfortunate that someone else also feels the same way as me and is going through this too.  it’s truly hell so i’m sending you the biggest virtual hug. i sincerely hope it gets better for you too and i’m sorry that you’ve also had to go through that, i know better than anyone else how difficult it is, so a big well done to you too for being so strong. it has been such a difficult journey but i tried my best not to give up so thank you again for understanding me on such a deep level and being so supportive. yes you are correct i know very well that bmi is the worst indicator of health in general however it’s the validation that my ed craves and wants to hear so bad which is why being labeled ‘overweight’ is almost like a confirmation of my distorted body image. it’s almost like it’s confirming all the negative harsh criticism in my head. as an anorexic it has also been my biggest fear which is why it has been so hard for me lately. i guess it’s just a panic response to my biggest fear. i would love to find a therapist that specialises in haes because of my negative past experiences but unfortunately in the uk, therapy is very expensive and i’m only a student so i cannot afford it. i can try and get help from mental health services but because they are voluntary and funded by the nhs you are put on a waiting list and it’s very difficult to be treated especially if you have already been denied by other mental health services. the best thing i can do for myself is just read books about eating disorders and further educate myself about it. i have already read an intuitive eating book which really helped me in my recovery and i’m currently reading another book that is helping me. both books are really helpful especially because i’m more aware about how the ed convinces you that you are not worthy of eating and distorts the way you see yourself but even though i know all of this i’m still suffering unfortunately. and i completely agree with you those practitioners shouldn’t be working in this profession if they are basing diagnoses on weight, it’s very unfortunate that individuals that already feel like they don’t deserve to be treated are being denied by ‘health professionals’ which just further fuels their emotions of ‘not being sick enough’. i really hope to see a day where all ed sufferers are treated the same way regardless of sexuality, race, weight or sex because that definitely isn’t the case now. i will try my best to keep fighting no matter how difficult things are at the moment because after all i know my eating disorder is just a coping mechanism and i’m trying to remember that there is nothing wrong with my body it’s just me trying to escape my negative thoughts and emotions. thank you so much again for commenting, let’s get better soon!",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/28/2021-2:42pm","Hi Lulu601!

Throw it out.  I have the feeling you may keep returning to the eating disorder if you don't do everything to try to fight this; if you don't apply what you learned; if you don't talk to a therapist to figure out why you keep returning so quickly and figure out how to stay on track and work through the underlying issues,  this will keep happening. Trust me, I know from experience.   I think, too, you like being taken care of, escaping stress from life, and the safety of the hospital.

The underlying issue Is trauma but until stable in my eating disorder I couldn’t work on it.

Are you just trying to numb yourself and to not feel?

That seems to be step 1 in your healing process. Go for it, so you can then go with step 2.I have never been inpatient but I can understand that is a great environment to feel safe and to apply all that is taught to us in therapy. Unfortunately, real life is outside. If we want to be able to enjoy life and the world outside, we need to be able to learn to survive to the triggers.Talk to your team.

67,07/24/2021,Icouldreallyusesomehelp,cpeeps,"I was inpatient from Dec. 2020 - March 2021 following a long period of restriction. I did partial hospitalization after I was discharged for about a month before stepping down. From about April-May I was doing really well. But since then I've completely fell back in to old habits and no one has seemed to notice (in their defense I've been really sneaky). This time around, I feel like my urges and behaviors are way worse than the first time last year. I've become even more scared of food and I'm really scared of what this is going to do to me if I don't figure out how to help myself because I'm leaving for college in two weeks. I really want to be able to do this on my own because I know it really affected my family to see me suffering last time. But I really don't know what to do. I compulsively exercise which I didn't use to do to and have even more fear foods. I'm at a loss and I feel like I've hit rock bottom. I have no one to turn to because none of my friends really get it, and I don't want to reach out to my friends from treatment because I don't want to affect their recovery. I'm also not currently seeing a dietician because I convinced my mom back in May that I didn't need to see one anymore. I feel like I've really messed everything up for myself and don't know what to do. I don't go out with my friends and spend pretty much every night at home so i can stick to a strict food schedule.

68,07/18/2021,10YearsLater,zenandrecovery,"I’ve been in recovery for 10 years. Throughout recovery, I’ve had ups of loving myself and downs of intrusive thoughts telling me I’m not worth self-love. Normally those intrusive thoughts are nothing more than a whisper, or something I can shut down easily by rationalization. Right now, they’re screaming. I’ve become aware of weight gain. Logically, I know it’s normal. My body is going to change as I get older. But even logical thinking isn’t enough to kick the thoughts out. When I look at mirrors or pictures, no logical thinking is louder than the voices that tell me how bad I look or point out how much my body is different. I remind myself that I’m my own worst critic. I remind myself that being active in an ED is no fun nor it is healthy. It takes more than it gives. And I’ve worked hard for 10 years to maintain my well-being.
I refuse to let myself slip back into hold habits. But I can’t kick these thoughts. And how down they’re making me feel. They’re getting louder and harder to ignore.",Annet,"Mon,07/19/2021-6:38pm","First of all, congratulations on your 10 years of recovery! That is a GREAT accomplishment.
I am sorry to hear you have been having those intrusive thoughts. As we age, our bodies change and it is normal to struggle with not wanting to have any gray hair or wrinkles. It also happens with weight gain. Most of the people struggle with it. However, for us with an ED background, the situation may feel a little bit more uncomfortable.I would suggest you to schedule a few sessions with a therapist so you can talk about this in a safe environment. It is better to do it now rather that leaving those thoughts to become louder.We need to keep them far away from us. The good thing is that you have already identified them and are working to silence them.Annet",zenandrecovery,"Wed,07/21/2021-9:16pm","Thank you for your kind words.
I’ve scheduled a session with my therapist. And I’m open with my supports about when I’m having a hard time. I refuse to left myself slip up because I know there would be no benefit.
Its just very hard right now. And only those who have experienced the same thing are able to understand how it feels. It feels good to know I’m understood.",Annet,"Wed,07/21/2021-10:18pm","I know how intrusive those ED thoughts can be. In my particular case, I struggle to silence the voice that wants me to exercise more than what my body is able to tolerate.

ED's happen in secrecy but if there is no secret at all, they struggle to ""survive"".

71,07/13/2021,Scaredoftherapy,Aloneinthis,"I have a therapy appointment in a couple days and I’m scared to tell him where my head is. I’ve been discharged for a level of symptomatology that far exceeded the qualifications of an outpatient office (per multiple therapists) and refused to go inpatient (years ago). My old therapist held our sessions as leverage to try to get me to do what he wanted. I’ve recently reread old emails to and from my old therapist. I’m on the fast track to going back right where I was. I’m embarrassed of the communications that took place. I’m also angry and frustrated that I was fired as a patient. I feel like if I could have been able to continue last time, I may have had the tools to not go through this again. I’m scared of being discharged before I gain these tools to be able to get rid of ED. I’m scared of voicing my struggles and I need a safe place to be open. I want to be able to feel safe in communicating where I am, but I’m terrified. At the moment, I have a lot of disordered eating behaviors going on. I’m starting to isolate myself (from family, friends and coworkers) again so I don’t have to be a part of outings that involve food; I’m restricting/fasting; I’ve even purged after several meals lately. I want to be able to talk about all the behaviors I am currently using. I need someone to objectively tell me what I’m doing is causing harm, even though I know this in my head. Lately I have felt accomplished when I’ve been able to restrict and watching the numbers on the scale go down have been rewarding. Again, in my head, I know I should be appalled at the measures I am taking to do this, but I’m not. I’m also scared that if I get rid of the ED then I’ll be obese and not be able to lose weight. My head is jumbled with ED and anti-ED thoughts. ED is currently winning.",recoveryj,"Tue,07/13/2021-2:09pm","I’m so sorry to hear how scared you are. It sounds like the ED has a really strong hold right now. I’m sending so much love and compassion your way.
You are in a different place now than you were before. But ED has a sneaky way of working itself back into our lives whenever it can. What would you feel about trying inpatient now? It sounds like ED is really driving the ship for you right now, and I know at least for me, it takes a hard reset to get back in the driver’s seat of my own life. I know it can be hard to be away from a job/family/etc, but your health and well-being is more than worth it. It’s the choice between spending your life isolated and in pain from ED and being disconnected from the things and people you love, and being away for a period of time but being able to return with a mindset that allows you to deeply connect and truly be there for your family, kids, and life! Like I said before, more than worth it. You are worth it. And inpatient can help teach you those coping skills and tools you feel like were missing before.
You know I’m your healthy brain that you don’t want yo go back. Don’t let ED win. It wants you to stay out of inpatient, because then it can still have a hold on you. Meet it where it’s at, and take it down.
You can do this.",Aloneinthis,"Tue,07/13/2021-2:35pm","Thank you for your words of encouragement. I’m at a loss for a way to articulate about how I feel regarding inpatient. I’m currently in a much better space, both mentally and physically than I was last time. I most certainly needed inpatient and I’m actually shocked at the lack of medical complications last time.I have many concerns about going inpatient/residential. Leaving work at the moment would leave my coworkers in a very bad place, we’re already about to be short on workers. I also feel like I’m not in a medically fragile state and would be denied by insurance and facility, which would almost certainly give me the green light to continue and/or increase behaviors. I don’t feel like I would thrive in a setting like that. I would be out of place because I’m not underweight and I’m also older than the average patient. I also think I would compete with and learn more behaviors from going in a group setting with individual who are eating disordered. Then there’s the financial aspect. Insurance doesn’t cover all of it and I would be missing out on full pay at my job. I would also be missing out on important time with my family. I know it might be able to help me push the reset button and be more present when I was back home, but I cannot fathom not being physically present during the reset. Actually, after being able to write it all down, I was able to provide a defense against inpatient. While I think it helps many, I don’t think it’s the right fit for me. I know I’m not in a good place mentally at the moment, but I feel like I regular therapy can help me destroy all these ED thoughts.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/14/2021-2:47pm","Hi Aloneinthis, we are sprry ypu are feeling this way and we care about you.

72,07/06/2021,willievergobacktomypre-edweight?,lulu601,"hi i developed my eating disorder during december 2019 and went into recovery around end of march 2020. i have since been in recovery and i’m nearly recovered. or at least i’m in the late stages. i feel much more comfortable around food my hair loss has reduced significantly and my period came back over a year ago. i eat whenever i’m hungry and although sometimes i do overeat i would say i’m way better than i used to be. yesterday i found pro ana tweets on twitter and became so triggered to the point i wanted to relapse. but i’m staying strong and deciding not to. i just want to know if i will ever go back to my pre-ed weight. my eating disorder started when i was 14 and even before my eating disorder i still had a disordered relationship with food. when i was 10 i started calorie counting and until i was 14 i was still scared of foods with high calories, felt guilty for eating them and slightly restricted or at least was watching what i ate. so i’m not sure if my pre-ed weight was even my natural set point because i guess i was still interfering with it. i’m now 16 and i’m way higher than my pre-ed weight and i’m wondering if i’ll ever go back to it and lose the overshoot weight naturally. i have heard anorexics lose overshoot weight 12-18 months into recovery but it’s already been 15 months since i’ve been in recovery and although i haven’t weighed myself i know i haven’t lost any overshoot weight. will this be my weight forever? i’m very worried about this since i’ve never even imagined i’d ever be this weight in my whole entire life. i was always very skinny ever since i was little and now i’m overweight.  please tell me if i’ll ever go back to being my pre-ed weight and how long this will take. thank you!",Annet,"Thu,07/08/2021-10:30pm","Weight changes over time depending on our age, life style, hormones, etc. If you got your ED while still developing and growing up, it is likely that your pre-ED weight will not be your after-ED weight.You are now 16, you are still growing up. Whatever weight you have gained that is over your set point weight will go little by little.The important here is that you do not try to restrict or control your weight. Protect your recovery as much as possible. Eventually, your body will set at the right weight for a healthy and happy you.CheersAnnet",lulu601,"Sat,07/10/2021-10:18pm","thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to reply to me, i’m having the urges to relapse esp bc of all the pro ana content but i’ll try and protect it as much as possible like you said because after all i worked so hard to get here. unfortunately it’s hard to accept that i may never go back to that weight but i wouldn’t want an ed again so i have to accept my gosh wherever it is. but either way i’ll listen to your advice and thank you for commenting, have a great day :)",Annet,"Sun,07/11/2021-12:40pm","You are strong and u can continue to fight for your recovery. I know many of us would fantasize with the weight we used to have when children or tenagers BUT adulthood comes with more weight, we are taller, bigger, stronger and completely developed. Do not try to go against nature. It is normal to weight more during our adult years than when we were children or teenagers.Hugs

I got my period back (a tiny bit anyway) on Christmas, and it's normal and regular now.But I still have severe cognitive issues! I can't think, I can't concentrate, I can't remember anything, I often forget what I'm supposed to be doing...I guess it's improved a bit - when I was really ill all I could do was sit and stare at the wall, to be honest - but it's still far from normal.This issue is really negatively affecting me. All I want to do is write my stories and essays but I can't because of this.What I'm trying to ask is - has anyone else struggled with brain function to this extent? When will it go back to normal?

More often than not, following ANY restrictive guidelines (regardless of their intent) can lead quickly back into disorder. Additionally, vegan diets are incredibly difficult to follow and still achieve eating disorder recovery. They restrict so many vital nutrients your body desperately needs to repair the vast amount of damage EDs wreak on the body. Please talk with a dietician who specializes in eating disorders to make sure you’re getting what you need. I’ve had some friends with no histories of eating disorders that experienced intense cognitive decline and mental fog JUST by going vegan. It can be very dangerous and keep your body in “starvation mode”. I’m so glad you’ve been on the path to recovery. You are doing amazing. I hope things continue to head in the right direction for you. Stay strong <3",eviefrye1868,"Tue,07/13/2021-12:07am","I did find that drinking enough plain water during the day would/does help me on those difficult days. Getting the right nutrients is also important. If you are unsure, it would be best to see a professional. They are able to take an unbiased look at your situation and help you through your anxieties or stressors etc. in order to make sure your medical issues and concerns get addressed. Brain fog is extremely frustrating. I have had it and so has my boyfriend (who does not have an ED). Try and remember you are taking care of yourself and a medical concern. It is hard to work at 100% when we have a cold, brain fog is not very different!

74,07/06/2021,Weightgain&regainingperiods,KateM04,"Hello...
I have been in recovery from anorexia for about one and a half years. In this time I gained weight and have reached a weight classes as the low end of ""healthy"" for my height. I have lost and gained weight during this time but never gone above the minimum weight set by my dietian due to pure disbelief and fear of what may happen if I completely let go off all food rules. I have restricted through counting calories and extreme exercise to maintain my low weight. About a week ago I decided I am done with anorexia, now all I truly want is food freedom and a healthy body. I have, over the past week, gone ""all in"", using the Minnie Maud recovery method as a guide... I feel terrible, like I am addicted to food because of responding to my extreme hunger, the bloating and discomfort is rediculous, but I keep telling myself this is normal and natural and will pass with time, I must persist with this short term to get to a better place. I will say I am finally enjoying food once again, the unconditional permission to feed my body what it wants feels amazing! But I still have no sign of my menstural cycle returning, has anyone been through a similar experience, how long does it take for periods to return? I have been at a low healthy weight for my height for some time now, and have gained more weight since going ""all in"", all I want is to get my menstural cycle back... Anyone who has been through a similar experience please help, thankyou! (:",Miggi,"Tue,07/06/2021-10:07pm","I am in almost the exact same situation. Maintaining a the low end of the healthy weight range. I have been in the healthy range for a year, but still no sign of my cycle. However, I am vegitarian, so I think it's my lack of iron and protein? Maybe that helps you, just want you to know that you are not alone, and I am in the same boat!",KateM04,"Tue,07/06/2021-10:35pm","It's good to know we're not alone! I do try to incorporate all foods into my diet but this is only since going all in, before I was still restricting the ""unhealthy/bad"" foods. I hope is comes back soon, just want to be healthy... Stay strong!",recoveryj,"Wed,07/07/2021-7:50am","Also try to remember that the “healthy range” is a bit of a misnomer. I am currently in the “healthy range”, but if I don’t gain weight, I will continue to lose bone density, develop osteoporosis, and probably break a hip before age 40. Weight is just a number. It doesn’t tell us anything about health or well-being. That’s why I am in a dangerous situation now - they didn’t realize my bone density was so bad because my weight was in the “healthy range”.  It took a doctor who really took my whole health into account to figure it out. It could be that you still need more nutrition; your body may still feel restricted and in starvation mode. And even though it’s sometimes nice not to have periods (believe me, I DEFINITELY understand that), it’s indicative of much more insidious damage being done. Hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle also protect bone density and even the heart. When though levels are low, organ damage is much more likely, and bone density will continue to decrease. It’s so hard but so incredibly important to get out of the mindset of “healthy enough” in regards to weight. BMI is not an indicator of health, and in fact, the “healthy range” has been manipulated and charged more than once in order for insurance companies to charge more money for healthcare. It’s a system based on statistics developed by a mathematician (NOT a doctor) who ran a study that only included white, European, males that fit his idea of a standard of beauty. Not women. No people of color. No diverse body sizes. Even he said BMI should not be used as a health parameter. And yet for whatever reason (I say that, but the reason is that it makes money - the diet industry is an over $70 million business in the US) people stuck with it. Please try to let go of the idea that you have to meet these standards or “be on the low end”. It sounds like that is taking away from your recovery, as doing so is keeping you in a restricted behavior/mindset. Allow yourself the nourishment you need.  I know the bodily changes may be scary, but please believe me when I say they’re so worth it. You are worth it. Your life is worth it.",recoveryj,"Wed,07/07/2021-7:39am","Amazing that you are going all in. That takes so much strength and courage. I’m so glad you’re finally embracing full recovery and freedom instead of “living on the edge”. Are you working with an ED team at all? Maybe they may have an idea for what you may be needing. All I know, is the more you nourish yourself fully and consistently, the more your body heals, and that will help you regain your period. EDs do a ton of damage to the body, even if we can’t always see it. It could be that right now, your body is still doing a lot of repair work. Try to be patient with the process (it’s the worst, I know) but know that you ARE healing and you ARE taking steps in the right direction. It might take a little time for the body to catch up, but you are healing now. You are well on your way <3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

76,07/01/2021,Exerciseinrecovery,Annet,"Hello there,Has anyone been able to recover without stopping a healthy amount of exercise over a long period of time?I have stopped exercise for 3 weeks or so. I only workout a healthy amount of time and days per week. However, I still find it very hard to miss a workout. My therapist says I am not ""addicted to exercise"" but that it is a strong habit in my life.The thing is even when I am super exhausted, I feel compelled to workout. Otherwise, I feel bad.How can I stop this from happening? Annet",2Healthy4me,"Sat,07/03/2021-5:25pm","That's how I feel about my precious daily walk. No local pools are available to swim at yet. So my secondary choice is taking daily walks, after dinner nightly. It feels like a method, for me, in coping w/ any stress, anxiety, and the need to stay close to my normal range for my weight.For you the need to exercise may be something else. How do you feel after you exercise? I always feel relieved, like i got a chore out of my way, for the day. Good luck, and hope you keep using healthy coping tools. Journaling really helped me too.",Annet,"Mon,07/05/2021-1:49pm","Yeah! To me, my exercise is a way to letting go all the stress and anxiety that I have in my life. Of course, it helps me feel ""lighter"" but I have been working out for so long that exercise has become a part of my routine. I also like walking. In the past, I used to be a runner. However, my body can not tolerate such as strong exercise any more... I also like journaling but not as much as before. It is like if putting a lot pressure on the pen when writing helped me release some of the feelings I have. It is magic...Annet",lulu601,"Tue,07/06/2021-12:42pm","hi annet, i know that exercise helps you relieve stress and other negative feelings which is great however feeling bad or anxious about missing a workout or working out even when you’re tired and exhausted is not healthy. i suggest you stop exercising for a while until you physically want to move. do fun movement and nothing too strong. fun movement can be yoga, walking (not long distances), dancing (not too extreme) and anything else that feels good. try and do exercise that makes you feel good only when you want to and try and do it for short periods of time so you don’t do it for weight loss or for a disordered reason. remember why movement is fun and do it for the positive mental effects and heart health not for physical changes. i also suggest you speak to your therapist about how to build a healthy relationship with exercising. but for now i think it’s best to not do it until you feel comfortable with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,07/03/2021,IthinkI'mrelapsing,lilhippie,"bit of background, I'm 22(F) and had an eating disorder between the ages of 10-17 before spending many years, and probably the rest of my life in recovery lol. I created a really great relationship with food, however I am a mental health worker, and since working many hours a week with somebody else with a severe ed has taken a toll i didn't expect. I cant even think of food without wanting to throw up and becoming extremely nauseous. Its horrible, and its really taking its toll on me, not having the simple ability to just be able to eat. The worst part is, it reminds of my ed all over again which is not only traumatic for me still, but also reminds me of why i liked my ed, even though guiltily. So that's bit of the mental and physical. For the client part, I am considering not working with her, but we've built really great rapport, she just lost her other worker, and my company is struggling to find someone who fits into what she likes. I also see the work I am doing with her is truly making a difference, even though its baby steps at a time. I do have a psych and normal GP, would love some feedback, but if not this felt good to vent!",Annet,"Mon,07/05/2021-1:55pm","At least to me, it has always been pretty triggering to see other people engaging on ED behaviours. In theory, when you are recovered that should not be an issue. But I still have my doubts about it. After all, our mind and our body do not forget all that they went through.I think you are taking the right steps. Trying to get that person assigned to other mental health worker will help to protect your sanity. I think the client will ask about the reason of the change. Be prepared either to tell her the truth or something else. I think she will understand.I think you do not have to relapse... If you are already aware of the ""early symptoms"", get help immediately. I know you are doing it but do not let this to take you back to the ED Hell.

78,07/05/2021,PotentialRelapse,Charliebarr,"Hi, I have been in recovery for about a year and a half. Ive had my hiccups and little lapses but I always remember it is not a linear process and try my hardest to get back on track and never let it get too bad by using my coping skills and trying to remember everything I learned while I was in treatment. However the last 3 weeks have been really hard for me. I have been obsessing over my weight and the thoughts are starting to become too much to the point where I soon won’t be able to combat them anymore. My eating disorder brain has started making workout plans for me and diet plans and so much more that I should not be thinking about. I’ve been trying so hard to get back on track but I am filled with guilt and self hate and it is becoming easier again to just follow my urges than to fight against them. I’m nervous that I am going to fall right back down and not be able to get back up. I leave for college again in a month and this makes me more nervous to think about going to a different state when my behaviors are acting up. If anyone has any advice or support that would be so incredibly helpful. Thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel positive I am weight restored which is great but terrifies me. I loved my treatment team there I loved my therapist honestly she was incredible she challenged me and was so caring and compassionate at the same time and just amazing leaving her was so hard after 2 months I Ike my therapist at home just I don’t know she was special. I am scared of going back to real life but am so happy at the same time to have freedom again. It was bittersweet to leave I feel it made a difference but I have a long way to go abs then probably going back to the same place for trauma treatment I had to be stable in my eating disorder first and insurance is weird too how it handles it I thought I was going to be there a month.

I’m happy she was there for you when you really needed the extra help to get you to a healthy place. It sounds like you still have a therapist at home that you trust.

I wanted to come back today and send you some supportI've been in a residential facility, and  I understand the ""strangeness"" of returning home.  Everything felt awkward.  Being with my family, taking a shower and using a razor to shave my legs without having a ""guard"" nearby.  Trying to figure out how to purchase food, and doing the ""exchange"" program, which didn't work for me; so I switched to calories and then just started to eat.  I could go on and on.  I'm just saying all this to let you know I understand the transition … even though it's personal and different for everyone.Remember that you're going from a clinical team who is trained in Eating Disorder recovery, and that you were under their control and lived in a different environment.  Now, you're the one in control and it's not easy to make that adjustment … especially in the beginning. What are some of the specifics that you need support for?  Expect some anxiety in making this transition.  You're trying to figure out how to bring home all that you learned at the recovery center, and move forward in your life.Did they give you books, pamphlets, handouts that you used in inpatient?  If they did, please be sure to refer to them, as needed, to help you remember what you learned there.",hermione3,"Thu,07/01/2021-10:35am",Thanks for the support this is not my first time out of residential I just have never been consistent after inpatient/residential. I have lots if packets abs assignments I did while in treatment. The transition is just so hard I have slipped up a few times already but a lapse is not a relapse which is what I learned. It’s hard not having therapy like every day and seeing my nutritionist twice a week and just constant support. I was also close to my therapist there so hard to leave her. I love my team here I do it’s just like so much treatment to do little  is a hard transition,DonAdele,"Fri,07/02/2021-12:08am","You're right … a lapse is not a relapse … that's a good thing to remember.  If you think it might help, get a calendar and put a sticker on your good days.  Seeing your progress might help you to continue.    I'm doing this.  And remember, if you slip during a day, that doesn't mean you have to wait until the next day to start over … don't ""start over"" … just continue with progress.I absolutely loved my therapist when I was in residential treatment … I get that.  I've had therapy twice-a-week for years … until now.  I'm going once-a-week now, and it's a big adjustment.  One thing you can do is ask for homework.  Have something to do in-between sessions that's relevant.  Talk about it with your therapist.Yes, transition is a challenge, and in some degree, it will be a little different each time.  You might have more strengths in some areas or more weaknesses in some areas.  Don't get stuck on your treatment team … they're gone now.  If there is something you can take from treatment that really worked for you, share it with your therapist and put it in your current therapy program.I just started getting involved in an online program.   No program works for everyone, but it might be another source of support to consider.Just wondering … I'm fairly new here so don't know your history … do you live alone?",hermione3,"Fri,07/02/2021-12:28am",Thanks for the support.

My team here is great too I just have only been with my current therapist since COVID after seeing another therapist for 13 years who crossed many boundaries and was in the end unhealthy.

My husband and I were seeing him for couple's therapy as well, and I had to commit my husband to not see him again … that was not easy.  I have a new therapist who is a trauma specialist and I like her so much.  I consider her a divine appointment … literally … too many things fell into place to call it coincidence.  The fact that you can email your residential therapist sounds like a ""plus"" for you.  Remember that all change can be scary … even good change.  Everything is a stepping stone … seeing friends … going back to work … etc.  You may feel some anxiety, so consider that normal.  It will all eventually fit into place.

I also don’t think it’s that bad to need the extra support. I know I have to do it in my own but sometimes I just need an extea push. I need to get out of the cycle sometimes and it just doesn’t break outpatient. And I plan to go back for trauma treatment because my nutritionist believes I need to do some work in a safe environment not just work in trauma then go home to my own devices.,recoveryj,"Sat,07/03/2021-7:50am","I think it’s a really good idea to get back into trauma work. EDs are so much more than they appear on the surface. And I would imagine that the trauma you have experienced definitely contributes. Hopefully, as you process and work through, you’ll need the ED less and less.
You’re right. It is never a bad thing to need more help or support, and I’m so glad you were able to access care this time. So many people in this society think that asking for help is shameful, when really it’s what humans are made for! We are literally designed for connection and for working together to bring each other up. Asking for help when you need it shows incredible strength.
I also wonder, because of the trauma and maybe even things that are going on right now, does home feel like an unsafe place for you? It feels like when you feel overwhelmed and unsafe, ED likes to fear its ugly head. Perhaps inpatient has been a way for you to finally feel safe. Maybe that’s something you and your therapist can work on - how to find a safe place and allow yourself to just be.
Stay strong",hermione3,"Sat,07/03/2021-1:53pm",Thanks for the support. I do need to do trauma work and I started it inpatient we just didn't get through all of it but I did some great work and it was hard but I need more. I do feel safe inpatient I just have been working on feeling safe in my own body and where I am which I was working on in inpatient feeling safe in my body and with myself i have body memories which makes me struggle to feel safe. I am hoping to stay stable in my eating disorder and go back to do the trauma program and my therapist there said she would love to work with me if i come back depending on census but she would love to continue our work together. She really6 made all the difference for me and I am doing really well right now but i know the test will really be when i get back to work and stuff.
80,06/24/2021,Scaredmybodywillneverreturntonormal,FloatingSystem,"I'm in recovery for anorexia and taking it seriously for the first time after struggling with it off and on since I was 11 (I'm in my thirties) and I've realized that even in the periods where I thought I was eating 'normally,' I was actually still really restricting and just in denial. I told myself I 'just don't need that much,' or 'I'm little, so I don't eat as much as other people.' When I tried to do a recovery program a few years ago and they put me on a meal plan to renourish my body, I freaked out and dropped out of the program, with the justification that they were being totally unreasonable and didn't understand my body, didn't understand that I didn't need to eat that much, and they were force-feeding me way too much. Yeah. I know. So now that I'm actually taking this seriously and following a meal plan, I'm having this realization, oh, sh**, I basically haven't eaten enough for over two decades and now I have to start doing that...and keep doing that. Like, this isn't just temporary, this is how I'm supposed to eat...all the time??!! I mean, I guess you're supposed to eat more in the early phase of recovery because you're restoring your damaged body, but still...oh my god. So this is making me freak out in multiple ways. First of all, I'm terrified about having to eat this much just...indefinitely because a) it's really hard to feed myself and feel in touch with and care for my body and b) it means I'll gain weight - and who knows how much. Second of all, I'm freaked out about what it means about how out of touch I must be with my body's hunger cues and how, like, dysregulated and messed up my system must be. Like, I've been thinking, okay, I relapsed into pretty bad AN for a year and a half, that's bad but repairable. But...two decades? How long will that take to repair? How long will it take for my body to get to some kind of normalcy? How long before I have normal hunger cues? How long before my body reaches some kind of set point, and my metabolism normalizes, and food stops making my body go haywire? That's really, really scary. So...I'm wondering if anyone else has just...experience with this? I know you can't give me medical advice, but I guess I wonder what it's been like for others in their process of their bodies recovering from AN. How did you deal with it? What was it like for you? Does it get less scary?",Journey2Heal,"Sun,06/27/2021-10:24am","Hi!First, I just want to say how brave and strong you are for entering into recovery no matter how long you've struggled with your ED. Second, although I'm not fully recovered myself and I've been working on it for a handful of years now, and what I can say is that it gets better. I have also struggled with anorexia for many years. I've been in a solid state of recovery and have since relapsed a couple of times. I'm climbing out of one of those relapses right now, in fact. So there are just a few important things I'd like to share with you. 1. It's very scary to get back to eating 'normal' portion sizes after the eating disorder mindset has convinced us that our bodies need less than others to get by for so long. However, over time, it gets easier! It's hard to plug away and keep at it. It will get exhausting. It will be hard. But in time, you'll find food to be less scary and more enjoyable! I promise!2. Recovery isn't linear. As I shared, I've relapsed a few times. Although it's hard, it's best to try not to allow it to get you down. It can be discouraging but one thing that I find helpful is that it's expected to be part of the journey. Each difficult hurdle that we overcome makes us stronger and better equipped to care for ourselves and persevere in the future. 3. Be kind to yourself. This is a tough journey and but you deserve kindness, self-compassion, and to be healed so that you can live your best life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,06/17/2021,Therapy,Aloneinthis,"Hi! I posted in “working toward recovery” last time and realized I wasn’t giving myself enough credit for the hard work I’ve put in and can post in “maintaining recovery”. This slip is just that, a slip. I don’t have to go back to where I’ve been before. A little about me, I am too old for this. I am well educated and have a great family and friends and a respected job. I have been considered recovered for five years, but have never had the ED “voice” go away. I’ve always thought about calories and how they are going to make me fat. I was in therapy for years for the ED and was fired for non compliance. My treatment team thought I needed inpatient and I refused to go. I was able to get pregnant and was able to put my baby’s needs before my own and gain the weight I needed to. I did it all on my own, because I didn’t have anyone willing to see me. Fast forward a few years. I am going through some very difficult family issues that are hard to navigate. Why am I choosing to do this to myself? Why do I feel like I have to numb my feelings? I know in my head this is only going to create problems and not solve anything. I now have a new therapist who doesn’t know my entire history. I’ve opened up a little, but haven’t divulged everything yet. He does know about the ED, as I’ve shared a little each session. Last week, at the very end he asked me how the week had been relating to the ED and I was honest. I could see the look of concern on his face, but we were out of time. He spent a little extra time with me I was relieved we didn’t have to chat about it longer, but at the same time I needed it. I have my next appointment tomorrow and I’m nervous about how he’s going to react. Is he going to fire me too, try to push me to someone else? I can’t start over again. I am nervous about the questions he is going to ask and wonder if I will be able to be completely honest.",recoveryj,"Fri,06/18/2021-7:43am","First off, congratulations on the steps you’ve made in recovery. That takes so much strength. I’m sorry you’re struggling again now. Know that you are so not alone; especially now. Even many people who’ve had years of recovery have experienced some lapses since the pandemic. It’s been so traumatic and triggering. It shows a lot that you’re able to recognize that you need more help right now. And you deserve the care and support to get through this.That said, the most important part of a therapeutic relationship is that you can be completely open and honest. I’ve found that the more I hide, the less I get out of therapy. And the more things just end up getting worse. I’m so glad you opened up a little to this therapist; he seems to really care about you. Our eating disorders often make us “non-compliant” because of how strong they are. How would it feel to let go and trust in a new process? I know EDs have us set in our ways/behaviors (something I’m struggling with a bit now myself) but how would it feel to let someone else take the reins? Maybe getting set up with and eating disorder team, meeting with an ED dietician, getting a meal plan, etc might be the best move right now. I’m not saying it’ll be easy. In fact, it’ll probably be the most difficult thing you’ve ever done. But. Remember. You’ve done it before. You can make it through again. You are so strong to be where you are. You owe it to yourself and your family to beat this.  ED doesn’t have to rule your life. I encourage you to continue to be open with this therapist and let him help you. Take it one day, one step at a time. You are not alone. And you can make it through",Aloneinthis,"Mon,06/21/2021-2:40pm","Hi! Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to me. You are so right, you get more out of therapy when you are open and honest. I wish I could say I was completely open with my therapist the other day. I cannot. He asked how the last week had been in regards to eating and I said better. They are not better. Kudos to him, as he did not take this at face value. He went on to ask about how I thought they were better. I was able to manipulate my words about how the week had gone to make it sound like it was better. I think I am still scared he is going to drop me like last time if I say too much. I’m scared he is going to think he doesn’t have the skills to be able to treat me. He is not an ED therapist. I’ve already been to most of the ones in my area and either didn’t like them or they refused to see me before I went inpatient (last time). I would love to be able to let go and completely trust the process, but I’m terrified of what that may bring. I know what I need to do, I just don’t know if I’m willing to do the work it takes. I know how to put together a meal plan, I just don’t know if I’m willing to follow it. I’m sure my old ED dietician would see me again, but I feel like my weight is too high to need her again. I’m not underweight and I feel like people would look at me like I was crazy asking for more. I just know where this path has led me before and I’m not sure I want to go back down the same path. Im trying to create a new path, but this path is the one I know and am comfortable with. I do owe it to myself and to my family to choose another path.",recoveryj,"Mon,06/21/2021-9:28pm","Have you talked about bringing up these fears to him? The fears that he’ll drop you I mean. It can feel so impossible to open up when there are such big fears like that looming. Maybe starting to discuss why you’re afraid and the reasons the therapists in the past didn’t work out could help give him a better idea of how he can best help you! I’m glad he helped you open up, even if it wasn’t fully. I hope you can continue to do so. As far as getting in touch with a dietician goes, YOU ARE SICK ENOUGH. Our eating disorders try to give us some ridiculous criteria to reach before we get help, but the reality is, you know yourself. And you know this path. And you know that it is not one you want to take! And if you want my opinion, if anyone thinks you’re “crazy” for getting help for this, it’s probably because they have their own disordered relationship with food and are afraid to face it. Most of this society has some type of disordered eating because of all the toxic lies the media and diet culture spread in order to gain money. That’s all it is. And weight? Bodies change ALL the time! Weight isn’t an indicator of health. It’s not an indicator of worth, love, passion, happiness, or anything that really makes life worth living. Your weight doesn’t define any part of you. It’s just your relationship with gravity. A number. If you’re curious about how arbitrary it is, know that the “defining criteria” for “overweight” in this country was lowered because insurance companies found that they could charge more money that way.
What I’m saying is, just because you’re not underweight doesn’t mean you don’t deserve help. You deserve to be free of this ugly, harmful, controlling eating disorder! You do owe it to your family and even more, yourself! And you can get there.
I hope you’re able to take that leap of faith and reach out. You sound like such a kind, compassionate, and caring person. You deserve so much more out of life. And you deserve help every step of the way. Humans aren’t meant to do it alone. And you are not alone <3",Aloneinthis,"Wed,06/23/2021-2:08pm","Hi! My current therapist and I have talked a little about the former therapist. When he asked about my ED background, he asked how bad it was and I told him my therapist fired me because I refused inpatient among a few other things leading up to that. He said he was shocked that someone would leave me hanging like that and promised he would never do that. It did provide a little bit of comfort to hear him say that, but my former therapist had said the same thing at one point. The only reason my old therapist didn’t work out was because I refused to meet his “demands”. I actually was very comfortable with him and shared most of my secrets no one else knows. I would love to bring this fear up with my current therapist, but I’m embarrassed that I need this kind of reassurance. Thank you for the words about a dietician. Sometimes, I know in my head that I am sick enough to get one, but part of me also feels like I know what to do and I’m not as far down the ED path as I’ve been before and I can do it on my own. I could not agree more with you regarding the lies of the media and advertising, and don’t get me started on insurance companies…I know in my head that my weight is just a number, that it truly is not an indicator of health. I wish I could view it as just a number that has no control over me, but I don’t. My therapist asked me what my current weight was the other day and I could not verbalize it. It’s not where I want it to be and it’s a number that I cannot force myself to say out loud. It’s a perfectly “normal” weight, so I’m not sure why I can’t say it. You are totally correct when you said I deserve to be free from this horribly harmful and controlling ED. We all do. No one deserves to go through every minute of every day consumed by numbers and food. I deserve better and my family deserves better. Thank you for saying I’m not alone, because much of the time I feel very alone in this.",DonAdele,"Sat,06/19/2021-2:55am","First of all, I'm too old for this too.  I don't have a respectable job, because I'm retired.  I've had eating disorder issues since I was nine.  I'm pretty much recovered from ED's, but one has really taken me captive because of complex trauma that doesn't want to let me go.  And I think that you and I probably struggle with the same thing … when the stressors get severe, we go back to maladaptive behavior because that's what we know.  The conditioning is strong, we may not have put other coping skills into place, and so we go to the ED, and hate it.  Even if there's not a lot of physical damage, the psychological can be brutal.  You ask, ""why"", but you probably already know the reason … your ED is your ""drug of choice"" to help you cope with the severe struggles of life.  I'm glad that you have a new therapist.  I do too, but I've only seen her once.  I totally understand how difficult it is to start over.  I think it's really important that you be honest with your therapist.  It's so crucial to be able to trust.  It's also crucial that you feel safe and that you're not afraid that if you say the wrong thing, you'll lose him, and as you say, be pushed off to someone else.  Do you think you can tell him about this fear?  I had the same kind of fear with the therapist that I just left … I actually fired him!  I did tell him though, long ago, that I was afraid that if I were totally honest, he would just show me the door and say, ""You can always go somewhere else"".  This is not something you want to carry around.In reading ""recovery's"" response, she wrote about having a ""team"".  Are you doing that right now?  Are you needing a dietitian and a food plan?  If you do, give this ""gift"" to yourself … it's essential to your well-being, and you have a right to be well.  The only person that you know you'll be with for the rest of your life is you … do this for you.  Are there other people in your life who know about your ED, and who can give you support?  Right now, I have 3 people texted me with messages for support … and the messages change.  Whatever I need to hear?...that's what I tell them to send.  It's really helping me break a cycle.  This won't work for everyone, and it depends on where a person is in recovery; but if there are people who can support you, maybe you can do a bit of brainstorming to see how they can help. Just an idea.Hope your therapy session was a good one.  Hope you feel a bit of encouragement.  If you need some challenges in between therapy sessions, talk to your therapist about what might be appropriate.",Aloneinthis,"Tue,06/22/2021-10:15am","Hi! I appreciate your reply. I’m sorry you too are struggling with an ED. You got it totally right, I use the maladaptive behaviors of the ED to cope with life when things get tough. When you said it’s my drug of choice, it’s tough to see that, but it’s totally correct. While I would never do drugs, I do choose this “drug” to cope with life’s stressors. I did meet with my therapist last week and I was not able to be open with him about the ED. I know I’m scared of another therapist pushing me off onto someone else. I’m not normally a needy person, but I feel like I need him to help guide me through this slip. Part of me is embarrassed to admit how much I’m struggling with the ED at this point in my life. I wish I could verbalize to him my fears, but I think I’m scared of being so vulnerable and risking rejection. I currently have only my therapist who knows what is going on. I have had a dietician in the past, but haven’t seen her for years. I have not opened up to my family or friends about this slip. It would be nice to be able to talk openly about this ED, but I think the shame of having such maladaptive behaviors is overwhelming. It would probably be beneficial to be open because maybe then people would stop talking to me about their latest diet fads and weight loss. My mom even congratulated me the other day on my weight loss and to keep it up. How does one respond to that?I plan to make a list of topics for my next therapy session and hopefully I will have the courage to speak openly.",DonAdele,"Wed,06/23/2021-2:54am","I have a concern from your first post.  You mentioned that this therapist is not an ED therapist.  It's important that he have skills to treat you.  If I had kidney disease and went to a liver specialist because I didn't like the kidney doctor, I would not get proper treatment.  This is concerning, and only you and your therapist can decide if this is a good fit.  If your therapist, at some point, does not feel qualified to give you the best care that you deserve, it's his responsibility to tell you.  If you're bypassing qualified ED therapists because you want to have tight control over your care, then you're really short-changing yourself.  I know this must be really difficult … to figure out how to get the best care.  My therapists are not ED specialists, but it's the best I can do for now because getting help with PTSD it crucial, and I'm hoping that the ED part of me will fall into line when I start healing from other issues.  I hope.  I do have some friends who know about my ED issue, and they're ready to help me in whatever way they can.That brings another issue into the mix.  Telling someone.  I've read, and believe, that you can't recover in secret.  What do you think?  I went into residential treatment many years ago … and I decided to confide in 3 friends before I went (others found out as well … I mean I was gone for 5 1/2 weeks).  My friends all had a different reaction, but their concern was unified.  I felt such relief knowing that someone else ""knew"".  It was like a massive weight off my shoulders.  They knew and remained my friends.  I hope you can find someone to confide in.  Be cautious.  Not everyone deserves to know your story.  I don't know how you would respond to your mom.  It's part of the secrecy of eating disorders.  My husband knows I'm having ED issues, but he doesn't know the specifics and I don't plan to tell him.  There's embarrassment and also … I don't want him to become the ED police and start interrogating me.  It would make things worse. My friends can give me much more support and be totally unprejudiced.  I hope that for you … that you can find someone to talk to.A list of topics is really good.  I do that too.  Would you have the courage to ask this therapist, ""Have you treated clients with eating disorders?"" and see what he says?  Is that too scary?  You certainly have the right to know.  As far as age, you need to work on putting that out of your mind.  I have it too, and talked to my therapist about it today.  She simply sees me as someone who is desperate for healing … age doesn't even enter the equation for her.  That helped me so much.  I asked her at the end of my session, ""Can you help me?"" and she said, ""Yes"".  I have to trust her, and that's not going to be easy.  I get it.Keep us updated.",Aloneinthis,"Fri,06/25/2021-5:06am","Hi! Thought I would explain my journey with different therapists. It’s quite complicated. Last time when I started going to therapy, it was for relationship issues with my husband. We started going to couples therapy and my husband thought it was a waste of time and money and quit going. We were still having issues, so I continued to go. It morphed from trying to heal the relationship to being all about me and ED. I was at an all time low with the ED and my therapist started making “demands” that he required me to follow. He required me to bring my husband to therapy and I had a real problem with it since he already thought therapy was a waste of time and money. He isn’t the most sympathetic man and also has the gift to gab and I didn’t want all of my innermost secrets shared amongst our friends and family. It was at this point I started to look for an ED trained therapist. There are very few in my area. I met with one and she told me she’s treated people who were much worse than me and I didn’t look that bad. At that time I was right at the cutoff for being underweight (one year before this, I was morbidly obese). The statement she made to me made me think I was failing at the ED and that I really wasn’t that bad and gave me the green light to increase the maladaptive ED behaviors. I then went to another ED therapist and she had issues of her own and seemed bored with our conversations, never really interacting. It was brutal going to her. Then, I found another ED therapist who was wonderful. She was very engaging and knew all about EDs and the questions to ask, because she knows that EDs like to be secretive and that I was probably not going to give out extra information unless asked. However, she refused to treat me until I went inpatient. She said my level of symptomatology at the time was too severe to treat as an outpatient and would only treat me after I completed an inpatient program. So, I found another ED therapist and she had problems of her own. She would talk about whatever juice cleanse plan she was on and I couldn’t deal with that when I was trying to get away from those behaviors. There are a couple more ED therapists in my area, but each time I’ve tried to contact them they are not accepting new patients. During all of the therapist shopping, I came to the conclusion the old therapist was the best fit for me, but he ended up letting me go because he too felt like I needed to be inpatient and I refused. So, long story long, I don’t have any options for an ED therapist near me. It’s not about control, it’s about trying to find a therapist who is willing and has the time to see me. I know it would be better to see someone who is specialized in EDs, but I am choosing a general practitioner over a “kidney” doctor because it’s the best I can do. I actually feel like my current therapist is a good fit for me. I obviously have fears that he will come to your conclusion that I need a specialist. I do want to bring this up to him, but this brings up many more issues. I don’t know how to even start that conversation, I’m ashamed and embarrassed that I’m even dealing with these issues at this point in my life and I know I’ll totally feel judged for bringing them up. I have a couple of close friends (who also happen to be coworkers) who know about last time. They still are sometimes the food police around me even though it’s been years since I was underweight. One of them is currently on a “diet” and she feels like she can engage in diet talk with me, since I know all about how to lose weight (insert eye rolling here). It’s so triggering to hear her talk about the low fat foods, the foods she’s cutting out, etc. This brings up work. The group of people I work with are all very disordered in their eating. I could go on forever describing all of their disordered eating/eating disorders, but that would just be me trying to throw blame on someone else for my current choices. I’ve made the choice to engage in ED behaviors, no one made me choose to go back to the behaviors. My husband is not sympathetic at all. He does not understand the first thing about EDs. My last therapist breeched confidentiality and called him and spoke with him about my symptoms at the time. He became the food police and put restrictions on exercise. Now that I see it in black and white writing this, he sounds like he was a good support person during my darkest days of the ED, but it was not done in a caring way. I do need to come up with a list of topics to discuss during my next session, I’m just not sure what that list would entail. My mind is going in a hundred different directions at the same time and it’s consumed my fear of the unknown and fear of the answers to questions that I may have.",recoveryj,"Fri,06/25/2021-7:58am","I’m so sorry for all you’ve been through just trying to get help! It sounds like your “ED therapists” had no idea what they were doing at all. And I don’t know how to express how angry I am that they would a) dismiss your symptoms based on your body (NEVER okay! EDs exist in EVERY body! They do NOT discriminate, and EVERYONE deserves help and recovery!) and b) that some would bring up their own diet stuff with you! That’s horrendous! In fact, that’s malpractice. They don’t sound like they should be therapists at all, let alone ED therapists! Stuff like that just makes me sick to hear. I can definitely understand your fears and hesitancy after going through all that!
I do have one question; what’s keeping you from inpatient? Is it fear? What are you afraid of? It sounds like even though you want recovery and know you need help, you’re still afraid of fully embracing it. And afraid of letting go of the behaviors that are actually hurting you so much. I know releasing that control is so terrifying (been inpatient twice myself). But please, believe me when I say it’s so worth it. Often, when professionals (who actually know what they’re talking about) recommend higher-level care, it’s for a reason. EDs have a way of hiding from us how sick we really are. Sometimes it takes a full reset like inpatient to actually start over and begin to form a life without ED. It is so scary to leave ED behaviors, the only coping mechanisms we know. But inpatient gives us an opportunity to explore what life could be like without those behaviors in an environment that DOES offer control and security. But without ED. They provide a safe place for you to explore your own natural abilities and healthy coping methods while you work through the underlying causes of ED. I know it’s so scary to think about, but I know I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for inpatient treatment. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but it was more than worth it. And so are you. You are worth it. And you deserve help and support <3",Aloneinthis,"Fri,06/25/2021-9:50am","Thank you for your reply. In my head I know a few of the therapists I tried were not a good fit and some had no idea how to treat someone with an ED. Looking back on it now, I can see how toxic some were, especially when one of the first things one of them said was I’ve treated people who are much worse than you. At the time I was barely eating and exercising way past exhaustion. I honestly have no idea how I didn’t have any more medical problems than I did. Don’t get me started on the one with the diets. I was in a very bad place last time and the two therapists who recommended inpatient were probably correct in their recommendations, but I couldn’t fathom leaving my family or job hanging while I was away learning how to eat and take care of myself. I currently am not in a place where I need inpatient. This time has not progressed to the place I was in last time. If I continue down this path, it will get to the point where inpatient would be beneficial, but I’m sure if/when I get to that place I will still be against going. It’s crazy that finding qualified ED help is so difficult. I am very thankful that I was able to find my current therapist. He feels like a good fit and he knows the right questions to ask and is trying to find ways to motivate me to make some changes. I just need to get over my fear of being abandoned again.",Annet,"Sun,06/20/2021-2:50pm","How did the session go with your therapist? I hope it went well. Honestly, I do not think he will fire you.

Part of me wanted to open up and spill all the secrets, but something was holding me back. We actually did talk about how this time is different because I am in a different stage in my life. There are major life stressors, but they are different this time. I am still at a point where I can change this around if I want to. But, the lure of watching numbers on the scale and clothes go down is such a high. It’s so much easier to just choose to numb my feelings by depriving myself of food than deal with the issues I’m facing. Hopefully next week I’ll be able to open up more.",DonAdele,"Wed,06/23/2021-5:53pm","I have a thought.  It sounds like you're not sure you want to change.  You do, but you don't.  You're lured by numbers on the scale.  Would you be willing to take a piece of paper and write a ""pros"" and ""cons"" column.  Write down the reasons you would like to recover, and the reasons you don't.  Take a good look at what you write.  Sometimes doing this, gives you a different perspective than just having thoughts going around in your head.  You can share it with your therapist and talk about it if you want.  As you've already learned, we don't ""outgrow"" an eating disorder.  And recovery takes a commitment.  You have a good start by getting back into therapy.  I hope this therapist turns out to be a really good match for you.",Aloneinthis,"Fri,06/25/2021-5:17am","You are totally correct in saying I am lured by the numbers. I am. It’s one of the most alluring parts of the ED, being able to have control over those numbers and being able to control the size of my body. I feel like I’m losing control in other aspects of my life, so this little shred of control is super enticing. I’ve made a list of the pros and cons and know in my head they cons definitely outweigh the pros (literally and figuratively), but I still have that but… I know that the ED steals from every aspect of your life and I don’t want that, but it’s so easy to fall back into the comfort of what is known. A common theme with my therapist has been how to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. I don’t have a good answer for that. Im not good at being uncomfortable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,06/22/2021,HowOftenShouldIeatAfterWeightRestoration?,vvrainbow12,"Hello all, Around the beginning of April, I was admitted into a PHP program for eating disorders. When I was discharged, I was claimed to be at my restored weight. My doctors seemed to think that I needed to continue having some snacks because of school at the time. However, they also said that morning snack was based on timing, so because I woke up early to eat breakfast before school, I needed a morning snack. Now that it is summer, I have been sleeping in a lot more unintentionally, and I have skipped morning snack, but not breakfast, since breakfast is important for everyone to have. I have skipped morning snack usually over the weekend, whenever I sleep in, and when I got weighed, I pretty much maintained the same weight. Now, some days I have a morning snack, but other days, I do not just because of timing. But now, I am worried that I will lose weight and that I will relapse. I'm just really scared about how much I should eat to maintain my weight right now, any suggestions?",recoveryj,"Tue,06/22/2021-11:10am","Congratulations on how far you’ve come in recovery! You are doing amazing! I definitely understand and relate to your fears. It can be so difficult sometimes after having ED to know if we’re meeting our bodies’ nutritional needs. Do you have a meal plan set up with your treatment team? I’ve found that to be so helpful for me, especially because my hunger cues are still sometimes off. What’s important too is that it sounds like you’re listening to your body and what it needs; whether that’s sleep, food, etc. That can be such a difficult thing to do, and you are incredible to be caring for yourself. If you are worried, I’d suggest bringing it up to your ED team, and if you find yourself hungry later in the day and want a bigger afternoon snack, maybe that’s your body’s way of making up for the morning <3

I think your fear of vomiting will play in your favour. In my case, this situation took me into bulimia. In your case, if you continue to avoid vomiting, you will overcome your situation.
As soon as your body is out of energy deficit, the extreme hunger will dissapear. For now, some strategies that could help are:
a) To observe your food when eating... pay attention to the colours, to the flavours, to the different smells.
b) Serve a plate of food (whatever is a healthy portion) and eat it slowly.
c) Practice some mindfulness before eating or do some deep breaths.
d) After eating, leave the kitchen and do something you enjoy
e) At all moment, be mindful of your stomach situation... How does it feel? Is it already satisfied? Does it need to eat more? Learn to listen to your body and to know when it has been enoughAnnet",recoveryj,"Mon,06/07/2021-7:46am","I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. It’s so good that you’re noticing your fears and anxieties surrounding this too, as that helps a lot with the process. It may take a little while for hunger/fullness cues to regulate after a prolonged period of restriction. It’s the body’s natural way of protecting you and keeping you safe.
Are you following a meal plan? I found it extremely helpful during recovery to be working with an eating disorder dietician who came up with a meal plan to meet my body’s needs, especially because those cues were so off. It can be so difficult to know if we’ve truly gotten enough and the nourishment we need. I would highly recommend reaching out to a dietician who specializes in EDs if you haven’t yet.
Also, try to just breathe and allow yourself to be. It could be you need more nourishment right now than you realize. Our bodies suffer immense damage due to EDs that we aren’t always aware of, and they need that extra energy to repair. It will also take a little while for bodies to trust that they’ll get the nourishment and care they need. Maybe giving yourself some space during meal times might help. I find it’s helpful for me to just turn on a show or podcast to have a distraction. It’s also always a good idea to make sure you’re eating throughout the day (I have to remind myself of this a lot). If you’re getting what you need consistently, then your body will feel less of a need to get in more nourishment later. Consistency is key. You’ll get there.

I am bordering underweight and I got off my calorie restricted diet at the end of May. Now, I am so happy that I can eat again I've been going a little overboard. I always finish a big meal, and get a snack or more to eat after a big meal. Every time. I have gained even more weight because of this, and now I feel I have to go on a diet again. This is how it usually goes. I go on a diet, and then I return and eat a little bit over my maintenance calories and slowly gain weight, and then diet again. Last night, I gave myself a treat for finishing school with good grades, and then I purged it right after. How do I end this cycle? I just need to eat to maintain, and not keep eating snacks after meals, does anyone have any advice or a mantra I could say in my head to stop me from getting a snack after a meal so I can end the diet snack cycle?",recoveryj,"Sat,06/12/2021-4:24pm","It sounds like your body is telling you you need more nourishment than you think. It is so good to hear you are listening to your body and meeting its needs! Bordering underweight is Not healthy. And remember that even that scale (BMI-based) is fundamentally wrong. It was never created to be a measurement of health, but instead consisted of a statistical analysis based on a MATHEMATICIAN’s idea of what was an “ideal” white, male, European body. So, it was for his own racist, eugenist goals. Even he himself said it should never be used for health! If you find yourself hungry and even maybe gaining weight when you’re not restricted, it’s probably because your set point is higher than you think. And that is OKAY!! Believe me, I know that’s hard to internalize. And it can even cause some grief. I know it did for me. But you deserve to be at your best, and to have that freedom with food! A higher weight can be HEALTHY when you’re responding to your body and giving it the nourishment it needs! Please don’t think you EVER have to restrict again. That is the ED trying to take you back on that slippery slope. You deserve to be free, to live your life. And to be healthy and nourished <3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,06/08/2021,ScaredofRelapse,whiteblossom05,"I thought providing some context for my situation would be a little important so hi, I'm a competitive swimmer and I struggled with BED and anorexia last summer, and I've been in recovery for 8+ months now. I take a lot of pride in telling my ED thoughts to go away and I've been very kind to myself, allowing myself to eat whatever I please.Today I decided to weigh myself for the first time in months and I freaked out. I figured it was mostly bloating and water weight, and I shouldn't compare this number to last year's but I know for a fact that I've been overeating. I feel sick all the time and am stuck at home which leads to eating out of boredom.I can't go to a nutritionist or dietician because my family lost their insurance pretty recently and are struggling financially. My diet plays a huge role in my performance in the water and I really need help. I don't want to relapse but at the same time, I don't want to remain this weight.By the way, I decided weighing myself was the way to go because I was basing my health and nutrition on how I looked (which changes easily because of my body dysmorphia). I thought relying on numbers and not what I see in the mirror would be a better approach.",recoveryj,"Tue,06/08/2021-7:37am","I know it’s hard, but please try to remember you are so, so much more than a number. Stuff like weight fluctuates on a daily, sometimes hourly basis. It can never define you.
I saw a post recently that talked a lot about body change. How we should never compare our bodies now to “what they have been”, because one of the things that makes our bodies so strong and resilient is their ability to change. Sometimes that change includes growth. And that is okay. So many things influence our bodies, and they adapt and adjust to try to give us the best they can for our lives.
You are so strong to be choosing recovery and allowing yourself to nourish your body the way it wants. You deserve to have those needs met. I’m sorry you’re struggling after seeing the number. But please remember that weight is just a measurement of the gravitational pull on your body. That’s it. Just like height is just a measurement of the length of your skeleton. It reflects nothing about you, your goodness, your abilities, or your talents.
You are you. And that is amazing. If you get the chance, I would highly recommend getting in touch with an eating disorder professional. They can be extremely helpful to navigate the anxieties around weight and nutrition. I’m so glad to hear you are still fighting for recovery. You deserve that. You deserve to live happily in your completeness <3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is this normal?",recoveryj,"Thu,06/03/2021-7:40am","First off, congratulations on your steps toward recovery. That is so difficult, and you have so much strength. I’m sorry it seems to be taking a while for the hunger/fullness cues to return. Often times, it takes a lot longer for the regular cues to come back. This is DEFINITELY normal. There’s a lot more damage that needs to be repaired after ED that we don’t realize - our bodies need the energy to fix that damage and regulate after such deprivation and trauma. It also just takes a while for our bodies to trust us again. We restricted them; they learned they couldn’t trust us to take care of and fuel them properly. It takes a little while to gain back that trust. Try to just lean on your meal plan in the meantime; trust the process. I know that is one of the most difficult things to do, but the more you allow yourself to receive nourishment and respond to feelings of hunger, the more your body realizes it can trust you again.

90,05/19/2021,Difficultconversationwithmyphychiatrist,Annet,"I work with a phychiatrist and a phychologist. Both of them do therapy. However, I have no rapport with my phychiatrist and in the last 2 years, I have only been going to her for medication management. She does try to do some therapy with me but I just do not open up to her. Today, I told her why I started spacing out our sessions since 2 years ago, why I do not share much, why I hate the fact that she does not answer to any simple questions I ask about herself or myself/my process and instead she returns them back to me. I know, therapy is about me BUT when the person on the other side of the chair does not talk, does not ask any questions, do not challenge you... what can you do? I told her that is not the style that works with me. I told her I simply get mad, frustrated or do not put any further interest in the relationship. I also told her about some transference that is happening there.Honestly, I thought that after being honest with her about what's going on I would feel better. Instead, I do feel worse. I told her I do not look towards to seeing her since long time ago and that I go just because it has become a ""custom"".I tried to not be harsh. I know I had to talk about it. But as usual, there was not closure on most of the things. So, I just talked, she listened and was told it is my responsibility to bring in to session what I want to work on.I know it is! But what happens when you can not share your darkest secrets to that person because you know she will only listen to and little or not feedback will be given to you?I am just venting. Thanks for readingNote. My phychologist is all the opposite. Thanks to God!Annet",recoveryj,"Thu,05/20/2021-7:40am","I’ve found the psychiatrists really don’t have the training that therapists and psychologists do in regards to therapy. I can definitely understand your frustration with her lack of interaction - I am the same way! I cannot work with a practitioner that does not challenge me/ask me questions. And it’s difficult for me to open up to someone I know very little about. It is well within your right to tell her what you did. And while it is your responsibility to “bring what you want to work on”, it sounds like she’s not even meeting you halfway.
I’d say, as long as you have a good relationship with your psychologist and are making progress in therapy there, don’t worry about your psychiatrist. I only see mine for meds too. You don’t have to tell her everything, especially because it sounds like she’s not willing/able to help when you do. I also find it’s hard to be that open and vulnerable with more than one person. I don’t know if that’s similar for you, but that can also have an impact.
Overall, I’d say, don’t worry about your relationship with her. Make sure she’s knows the basics for med management, but turn to your psychologist for actual therapy and help. I’m glad you have her. Everyone has a different approach to therapy that works best, and it sounds like your psychologist has one that works for you",Annet,"Thu,05/20/2021-8:48pm","Thanks a lot for your response.

Also, she wanted to find a reason for everything. Sometimes, things happen and there is not always an emotional load behind.I understand the part of being vulnerable and open with 2 people.

Of course, it is their option to not want to share their personal life. However, I still understand what your saying. It took me about a year to open up to my therapist and really delve into my trauma. Heck, I still haven't told my therapist I have and ED. In the end, you really have to build trust with a person to be able to share your feelings and your secrets with them.

For me, I find it’s a lot better to leave opening up and processing things for my therapist. Yes, my psychiatrist knows the broad ideas/diagnoses so she can help me med-wise, but I have never actually opened up to her about a lot of things. In fact, it would be pretty useless for me since my psychiatrist switches a few times a year (I go to a clinic that uses psychiatrists in their residencies). I’d have to start all over so many times if I tried to completely open up to my psychiatrist. I have a therapist with whom I connect and work very well. That’s where I get my work done. It sounds like trying to force this relationship is causing you more harm than good. Why not let her just do her main job - helping with meds - and leave the deeper processing to your therapist? It sounds like you work a lot better with your therapist anyway. You don’t owe anyone your story or your deep emotions/trauma. You don’t owe your psychiatrist anything. She’s here to help you. And sometimes, the best help just looks like med management. And that’s okay! That’s literally her job! Allow that to rest; you have no reason to feel guilty.

91,03/18/2021,RecoveringfromAnorexia,Recoverfreedom,"Hi everyone!I’m currently in recovering from anorexia; however, I’m afraid I have developed binge eating disorder. I have gained weight within 6 months and I feel disgusted with myself. I’ve been having severe bouts of extreme hunger which will turn into full binges. I have been eating a lot of desert each day in addition to my normal food. Just this past month, I have gained more weight and I really want to go back to my eating disorder of anorexia,
I see old pictures of myself and I just don’t feel like myself anymore. I feel like I’m too fat and none of my clothes fit anymore. I’ve tried to just eat healthy, but every evening and every night, I tend to just binge on sugary foods. I seem to do fine until I start eating dinner. It’s like as soon as I start eating, I can’t stop. I just keep wanting high calorie foods. I, really afraid of gaining any weight. Can anybody relate to what I’m feeling or have any helpful advice?
Also, a lot of my friends are going on diets and it’s very triggering for me. Now that summer is coming around, I’m definitely not ready to go swimming as I have gained so much weight and I would not be comfortable in a bathing suit.

Are you working with a dietician who specializes in EDs? They can really help you come up with a meal plan that helps you make sure you get what you need throughout the day. Making sure we’re adequately nourished is so important! As far as the extreme hunger goes, that’s also something I relate to. It will go away, but it’s our bodies’ natural way of trying to make up for all the restriction and get what it needs to heal! As distressing as it can be, it’s extremely adaptive - our bodies are trying to save us! So much damage caused by EDs we cannot see, and it takes a while for our bodies to heal. Just keep making sure you’re giving your body what you need, and regular hunger cues will start to come back. You’re not alone. Stay strong",Fully_Recovered,"Mon,03/22/2021-1:32pm","Hi there!  I can relate very well to what you are going through, and I know how scary and uncomfortable it is.  However, please don’t stop now and do what you can to hang in there as it’s definitely worth it.
I had an eating disorder for almost 20 years, and I cannot tell you how many times I had to go through this.  That’s how I know how scary extreme hunger and weight gain is and how uncomfortable it feels to “not be in control”.  However, this feeling of “control” is usually part of your disorder.  Your body wants to survive and repair the damage that has been done to it.  I don’t think there is a ton of research into the phenomenon of extreme hunger yet, but there is definitely some (the Minnesota study comes to mind), and I would say most people who have dealt with restrictive eating disorders (or restrictive eating in general) have experienced this phenomenon.  If you let your body heal, it will go away, but the time it takes for your body to trust you again is different from person to person.  For me, it came in bouts of several weeks where I could literally eat all day, then I would have phases where I ate more normal portions, and then, I would have another bout of extreme hunger.  After almost 20 years, my body took its time to trust me again; after all, I had deceived it too many times before when I attempted to recover, but it got there, and I can assure you that I no longer have to (nor want to) eat the way I did during my recovery, that I can 100% trust my hunger and satiety cues, and that my body didn’t keep gaining weight into oblivion (even though it seems that way when you’re in the middle of it).
Having said that, I know that scientific or biological facts don’t always cut it.  However, and I cannot stress this enough, if you give up now and go back to restriction, you will just kick the can further down the curb.  And it won’t get easier, on the contrary.  Reading this, you might even think, ‘I wish I could go back to my anorexic days but I can’t even do that’.  These are deceiving thoughts that you should do everything you can not to listen to.  It won’t help you, and it is the part of you that’s still under the spell of the disorder.  I know it might feel overwhelming to deal with everything you’re dealing with.  Maybe it helps you to take some time every day to honestly think about what exactly you want your life to look like.  This shouldn’t be an exercise you do in passing, but something that you actively take time out of your day.  I don’t know how old you are, and depending on where you stand in your life, some of the following suggestions might not apply to you, but you might want to go to college.  Or you might want to go to grad school.  Or you might want to travel.  Or you might want to go after an interesting internship or job opportunity.  Or you might want kids.  Whatever it is, visualize it and think about it in terms of your current issue: would you want your thoughts to be consumed by food, what and when you eat next, etc.? If you look 10 to 20 years down the line, do you still want to be as unfree as anorexia has made you?  Or would you rather be happy, healthy, and full of energy?  While not being dismissive of your current issue - I know it’s very important to actively deal with your fear of your hunger and your weight gain and if you don’t have counseling, you might want to see if you can look into that - I can say for myself that those thoughts were what saved me during my own recovery.  The straw that broke the camel’s back so to speak for myself was the thought of the rest of my life to be consumed by thoughts of food, food labels, and stress around food.  I’d just had it, and I wanted to be free.  It was hard work, a lot of tears, a lot of feelings of guilt and shame, but also a lot of happiness, a lot of laughter and smiles, and the first time I caught myself at a bbq or family gathering where I could just relax, enjoy both the company and the good food (without making the latter the absolute center piece of the whole thing) was mind blowing.  You will get there.  But you have to put in the work.  And if that means that you have another couple of months of an uphill battle with what you call “too much food”, let your body heal itself.  If you haven’t already and have the option, seek out a doctor and therapist that have experience with eating disorders and understand what you are going through.  And as much as you can, eliminate all triggers that you can get around.  If that means to tell your friends not to talk about their diets to you, do that.  It always seems so hard, but I’m sure most, if not all, of them will understand.  You don’t have to be perfect - and there is no such thing as perfect recovery.  But please don’t give up.  If you do it now, if you go through a couple of hard months now, if you keep at it now and let your body find where it is comfortable and how much it actually needs every day (that goes for food, sleep, breaks, calm and quiet), you will have many more summers where you can enjoy time by the pool / at the beach / in the mountains without obsessing over how you look or how many calories your last meal had.",DecadesofDisorder,"Fri,05/21/2021-6:34pm","FullyRecovered offers some great suggestions and are ones I'm using in my own recovery of 30+ years of Anorexia and Bulimia.

When I was in recovery, fighting the fear of weight gain while eating was the fear I was working on in therapy, but that allowed other fears to come to the surface--such as getting sick or feeling lousy after eating, etc. I don't know the extent of your ED, nor do I intend to make ANY assumptions as everyone is different...however, I do know that different fears/concerns are associated with different people. Eating is such a complex and intimate thing, and many don't realize this. But eating in recovery is definitely an adjustment since your body is getting used to the amount in your stomach, the caloric intake, the sheer EXISTENCE of food in your body that some discomfort can be normal. I used to get stomach aches, gas, nausea, you name it--and it can cause our brains to say ""eating is bad for me if I feel like this!"" However, it's your body getting used to what it NEEDS again. With the introduction of the correct amount of food to your body in recovery, it will take some time, but be patient. It's also an opportunity to see what foods your body thrives on, and being aware of the foods that do make you feel great, which is an exciting part of growing in recovery. Each and every bite is a battle, or can be. With each bite, it's a reminder you're growing, you're moving in the right direction, you're choosing YOU and that's the coping method. Each bite, each meal, each day--focus on the fact that you need food to survive, and that your body will adjust and get stronger. Prayers, love, encouragement, cheerleading pom-poms, #1 foam fingers, all for you bugplaymom. Glad you're in recovery, keep up the good work <3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,05/08/2021,PromNightCrisis,Miggi,"I was watching my brother walk the stage for the Prom grand march. I wasn't in prom myself. I looked around at all the girls in their pretty dresses and felt so ugly. I was wearing a really big casual dress (big because none of my clothes fit me) and layers under it and a jacket because I was cold. I am very depressed now and feel so ugly. I feel like I can never be one of those pretty girls... I am on a restrictive diet now, and I was feeling better and ready to stop soon, but now I just want to go longer. My stomach is always bloated and I would look at the older girls in their dresses and they weren't bloated. I feel so lost, empty, and ugly. Does anyone have any words of wisdom?",recoveryj,"Sun,05/09/2021-7:36am","Unfortunately, the longer we restrict, the worse we feel, both physically and mentally. In fact, it could even lead to some of the bloating you’re experiencing. Remember that comparison is the thief of joy. You are not them, they are not you, and they are not each other! Often times, I’ve found that when we’re taking care of ourselves (i.e. not restricting) we look our best. That’s because our bodies are taken care of, and they trust that they’re going to get what they need. If they’re in constant fight/flight from feeling deprived/starved, of course we won’t be looking out best!
But at the end of the day, are looks really the most important thing? And if so, will you ever be satisfied? I found that for me, no matter what “objective” my eating disorder set me up to achieve, when I got there, I would still never feel good enough. Body image is one of those really tough things that goes way deeper than surface-level. It took getting out of restriction, out of ED and ED behaviors for me to even begin to start to unpack my insecurities about my body. It’s not your body; it’s not your size. You are deserving of care, rest, nourishment, and food. Every. Single. Day. Remember you will never be beautiful like someone else because you are meant to be beautiful like YOU. and that in and of itself is pretty amazing",2Healthy4me,"Mon,05/10/2021-7:20pm","Either at your school or college? Or could you ask your parents to find you a counselor.

Just getting into a routine of self help is a good start. I enjoy journaling a lot. Then before Covid I loved regular exercise. Just use some time to research your options in your local community, colleges, or even by calling crisis lines. They also provide local referrals, not just deal w/ the crisis stuff...

I have 100% struggled with this. I made a post a couple weeks ago about the end of my dietician sessions and how difficult that was for me. One thing not many people seem to talk about is how much loss there is in recovery. It is so hard, and something many people don't understand. I think with treatment teams we find comfort and understanding, something that a lot of us lack in our personal lives. I worked with my outpatient dietician for 3.5 years and I know she genuinely cared about me. My dietician clearly told me if I ever needed any help again, I was one email away, which helps. But it's still loss.
I think in recovery it's so important to build another community, one that is apart from the ED community and even the recovery community. Make new friends, discover new hobbies, explore new places.

101,04/16/2021,bingingv.shunger,meow_masterr,"I am very new in recovery and haven't been clinically diagnosed by a doctor (actually going to the doctors tomorrow morning) but my parents say I meet the criteria for anorexia and I have all the symptoms. However of course since my parents found out about this a few weeks ago, they've been pushing me to eat more, and sometimes I find myself actually getting hungry throughout the day vs. how it used to be, where I would only eat because my parents were making me. Sometimes I get so hungry I'm afraid I'm binging. I don't know what's going on. Also since I have my doctors appointment tomorrow I'm afraid that it's either going to make or break my recovery which is already unstable most of the time. I feel like if I do get diagnosed with anorexia I'll be depressed that it wasn't all just in my head and I have actually done this to myself and the realization will hit me even harder. However on the other hand if I get diagnosed with something else like just disordered eating I will feel like it really was all in my head and I'll feel like it's not that bad so why am I in recovery for an eating disorder I don't have. I don't know why I feel like this.
Also this is out of no where but I just wanted to say it. I've been feeling hungrier yes, but I still get all of the guilt and shame from eating literally anything. It feels like I can't eat anything without feeling guilt and shame before and after eating and I always regret eating after I do eat.",recoveryj,"Sat,04/17/2021-1:42pm","First of all, you are so, so not alone. Eating disorders lie to us - they simultaneously make us feel like we’re making it all up and then guilty for having hurt ourselves so much. It all is just such a vicious cycle. Regardless of how “severe” things seem, your struggle is completely valid. And you DESERVE help and care. You deserve recovery. From what it sounds like, you do have an eating disorder. Even though in this society, many people exhibit disordered behaviors when it comes to food, that just means they’re right along with us. Your struggle is real. You are NOT making it up. And you did NOT choose this. Your eating disorder is not and never was your fault
Also, being hungry again is a GOOD sign! I know that’s hard to see because having that feeling again can be so, so terrifying. Right now, try not to worry too much about bingeing (eating disorders tend to lie about that too). Honor your hunger cues. A lot of the time in recovery, our bodies need way more than we realize to help start to heal the vast amount of damage eating disorders have on the body. Allow yourself to heal. You DESERVE food. If you do nothing all day, you STILL deserve nourishment and care. I know it’s scary, and the feelings of guilt afterward are so hard. But often, those are coming up not as a result of eating directly, but from something deeper. It may help to journal about the feelings that come up when you honor you body and your hunger cues.
I also highly encourage you to seek out a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. They can really do a lot to help sort out the true source of those feelings and start to repair your relationship with food and your body. You matter. You deserve care.

I can also relate to this, as my labs are good now, but my body is dying. Yes, I am in recovery, but I have done so much damage to my body (partially because it was ignored due to my “good labs”) that it is doubtful I will ever bounce back.

Take advantage of the time you have now. You matter so much more than any job you’ll ever have. Get that care. You are worth it. I know it’s terrifying, but if you ever want to work your dream job (or even just a stable job) again, there is no other way.

103,04/13/2021,Recoveryandamenorrhea,EdRecovery55,"Hello, I am new to the community and wanted some advice from someone who would understand what I’m going through because my mother is very unsupportive and I don’t have anyone to ask for help. I have been suffering with an ED for about a year and I decided to go all in about 3 weeks ago, due to the extreme hunger and the fact that I simply couldn’t go on any longer. I lost my period 2.5 years ago due to stress, while still being at a healthy weight, but then developed an eating disorder 1.5 years later, and my weight decreased to the lowest it’s ever been. I’ve put on a bit already and know I will continue to put on a lot as I listen to my extreme hunger, but I am fully committed now and there’s no way I’m going back. I was put on hormones in Autumn 2019 and took that for 4 months, then took some other hormone pills to induce a period but I was still underweight so it only lasted 2 cycles and then was gone again for 2 months. Then I started eating more and recovering and it came back for one cycle and since then I haven’t had it. Since then it has been 6 months. I am currently in the extreme hunger phase of my recovery. A couple weeks ago I went to a gynaecologist and she said I MUST take hormones for 3 months at least to get my period back otherwise it will never come back because she said my ovaries APPARENTLY aren’t fully developed that’s why I don’t have a period, but she said everything looked good on the ultrasound. I really don’t want to take the hormones as I want to get my period back naturally, and I just don’t believe that without the hormones I won’t ever get it back, because I’ve searched the entire internet and have read HUNDREDS of ED recovery stories and women get it back naturally even after 5-10 years of not having a period. I am fully committed to recovering and gaining as much weight as my body needs, whatever that number might be, and reducing my stress levels and starting acupuncture soon which I’ve read has helped so many women get their periods back. Basically, should I wait and see if I can get it back naturally or just take the hormones? I really don’t know what to do, but my gut is telling me to wait and try and get it back naturally.",recoveryj,"Tue,04/13/2021-1:29pm","I’m sorry I don’t have a lot of advice, but hormones can do more for you than just induce the period. You may be able to wean off them when you are further in recovery, but I HIGHLY recommend you take your doc’s advice on this one. Sometimes waiting for it to come back naturally may actually make things worse. For example, I still haven’t got mine back (been in recovery for 6+ years) and because it’s because of the hormones, my bone density is dangerously low (almost osteoporosis). Estrogen/testosterone are not just “sex” hormones. They protect your bones, allow them to develop, and without the hormones, bones literally start dissolving. It sounds like your body is still developing, so you have the chance to make sure this doesn’t happen to you. Please, take your doctor’s advice. I know it may be frustrating, but it will help you, especially early on in recovery. And like I said, as you get farther along, I’m sure you’ll be able to naturally have periods as long as you stick to the recovery. It sounds like you are doing an amazing job so far, and you should be so, so proud. It’s not easy, but I know you can make it

104,04/07/2021,Relapsethoughts,Kali_,"I am a few months into my recovery from anorexia now and I feel like most of the time I do ok (like I dislike how I look but I just try to not think about it and I’m usually really good about eating enough) but sometimes I just feel so sad and hate myself and the way I look so much (exactly the kinds of feelings I had when I started really restricting a couple years ago). It’s like I crave the way restricting made me feel, the good parts and the bad parts (like I miss being absolutely miserable all the time??). It just kind of feels like I’ll never be free from wanting to go back to it and like maybe it would just be easier if I did:/ does anybody have any advice for these feelings?",luness,"Thu,04/08/2021-9:58pm","This is totally normal. I am three years into recovery from anorexia and I can say that, though this ""craving the ED"" doesn't totally go away, it gets WAYYYY better with time. Even today, though, if I listen to certain songs that came out around the time I was in the thick of the ED, it triggers some odd feelings of ""wow I miss those times."" Eating disorders are very similar to other addictions in that they artificially trigger the reward system in the brain.
I don't have the best advice other than to tell you you're not alone and that it's so important not to succumb to those cravings. Just like a recovered alcoholic can't just ""take a sip"" for danger of falling back into the addiction, so too must we be wary of those cravings. Even when we're not feeling those cravings, it's so important not to do anything reminiscent of the old behaviors.  That means not hopping onto the diet train with your friends when you're two years into recovery and think it's fine.  I am a member of a religion where we fast once a month, but I have made the decision not to fast (perhaps ever again) because it brings back too many triggering memories of my addiction to self-deprivation.",Ladybug120,"Mon,04/12/2021-6:03pm","I've been heading towards a relapse recently, so I completely understand craving the ED. That's one of the hardest things for me, is craving how it made me feel. I fast every month as well as part of my religion, but I have been using that as an excuse not to eat all day, which I have to stop doing, but that's a topic for another day. I just try not to think about it. My friend helps me by distracting me while we're eating. It's something that personally helps me, I don't know if it will work for you. You should give it a try. It feels like an accomplishment when someone else is proud of you for it as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
105,04/08/2021,Relapsing-ButwithDifferentSymptoms?,luness,"Has anyone else experienced a complete lack of appetite and/or food repulsions in their recovery? I can't find anything about this online!
I began my recovery from anorexia almost three years ago and can acknowledge that I never fully recovered, both in terms of weight restoration as well as healing my relationship with food. When I was in the thick of the ED, I craved almost all foods but heavily restricted because I believed everything was unhealthy. I thought about food all the time and frequently cooked for other people. Now I am much less rigid (I abolished most of my food rules), and I don't feel guilty after I eat. However, I almost never feel like eating. My hunger cues are shot, so that doesn't help.  Picking food, cooking food, eating food and cleaning up after food feels like such a waste of time. Occasionally I will make an elegant meal that I feel excited about only to feel repulsed by it halfway through my plate. Some food smells even make me feel sick (and no, I'm not pregnant). Most of the time, though, it's just me scrolling through dozens of recipes on Pinterest only for nothing to look appetizing in the slightest.
I know I need help.  My husband has to literally coerce me into eating every meal, and it's a source of a lot of tension. But my university counseling center turned me away because I needed ""more specialized care,"" and I'm too broke from paying for grad school to be able to pay for the care I need (assuming I can even can get on the long wait list).",_admin_moderator,"Sat,04/10/2021-11:28am","Hi luness, Welcome to the forums!

108,03/25/2021,TheendofdieticiansessionsandEDNostalgia,imstillgrowing,"Hi Recovery Family!It's been so long since I've used this forum. I've been in recovery two years now, which is a huge accomplishment and I'm very proud of myself. But my dietician, who I've been seeing for 3 1/2 years, thinks I'm ready to stop seeing her. I thought I would be excited when this moment came. After all, we've only been seeing each other about once a month for quite some time now. However, I'm feeling fearful and lonely instead of excited. I am pretty solid in my recovery AND I still have a lot of ED nostalgia. There are many nights when I lie awake imagining a relapse. I never thought that two years out I'd still have such pervasive thoughts. I am so thankful that I'm at a space where I can acknowledge these thoughts as just thoughts, and not fall into them. But with the ending of my dietician sessions, I am finding the nostalgia is kicking up a notch, and part of me thinks it's because losing my dietician feels like that--a loss. I know I'm not really losing her, as she says I can always schedule another session if I need it. I think it's also a reminder that I'm not sick anymore. That I don't really fit into the ED community anymore, which was also a loss. Why did no one tell me there would be so much loss in recovery??So I thought I would post here, because I need a little support. I love recovery and all that's it's allowed me to do. And I hate the ED, and the way it's always trying to sneak back into my life. Blessings, fam.",Tryingtoheal,"Fri,03/26/2021-7:45am","I know you don't recognize my new name.  I used to be savedbygrace or precioustomysavior.  Anywhoo, it's so good to see you here again!!  I understand the sadness and the feelings of loss.  I don't have friends besides my husband,  cat and sometimes mom.  So going away to facilities and being part of a community always felt safe.
  Of course, that wasn't my main reason for going, but it was a part of it.
  Over time, this gut wrenching feeling will fade.
  Do you see a therapist?  This would be a good thing to process there.
  Unfortunately it's just going to take time.
  I am really proud of you for your hard work.",imstillgrowing,"Fri,03/26/2021-1:19pm","Oh my goodness, it is so good to connect with you again! I looked through the forum to see if any old friends were still here, and couldn't find any familiar names from when I was active on here. Wow, thank you so much for remembering me and encouraging me. You were so helpful to me when I was in such a rough spot a couple years back. I am exceedingly grateful.
I definitely feel that longing for community at treatment. There was a long while where I couldn't really understand why I was nostalgic for treatment (as it wasn't particularly fun lol), but then I realized: I came alive again at treatment. I went from being a shell of a human to giving life a chance. So of course I'm going to miss it sometimes.
I do see a therapist still, and I'm going to see her today thankfully. I usually get weighed at my therapist's because I see my dietician virtually (I've moved to a different state since treatment but kept my old dietician). I don't know what we are going to do about monitoring weight going forward, and I'm nervous about that. So I guess today we can talk about that, and I'll be honest about my nostalgia and fears.
Thank you for encouraging me that the gut wrenching feelings will fade. I feel like they come in waves--sometimes I'm so happy in recovery and don't really think about relapse, then all of a sudden they crash on me so hard.

I recently relapsed myself,  but I was able to rescue myself and get back in recovery.   I'm glad you'll be able to talk to your therapist about all this.  I'm honored to have played a part in your recovery.   I think it's a little like a funeral when moving on from your eating disorder and treatment, sort of like losing someone you were close to for many years.
  I'm trying to work through my 30 years of traumas.  I was hospitalized a LOT last year for being suicidal and having plans to harm myself.   I've been seeing my therapist since June of last year.
  Please keep me posted on how things go.",imstillgrowing,"Sat,03/27/2021-1:59am","It was really good to talk to my therapist today. She said that she can continue monitoring weight, so will let me know if I need to start seeing dietician again so that made me a lot better. She suggested I maybe write a letter to my dietician, one that I don't necessarily have to give to her but just to help me process my dietician's part in my journey. You talking about a funeral really resonates with me. I mourn the death of my ED, and of treatment, and of being ill. So strange to think we would mourn that death, but here we are. We are all just trying to heal :)
I'm so sorry about the suicidal ideation and hospitalizations. How is your recovery from that going? I cannot imagine the amount of grief and despair you were in. I hope and pray your mind has found some peace. I'm also sorry about the relapse, but am so proud you were able to find recovery again. It's a lifelong journey I believe! Working through old traumas is so hard, isn't it? Once I was about 6 months out of treatment, I was able to really start processing past hurts and trauma. I was a mess for several months, crying at random things (and I'm not typically a crier).

She gaslights and manipulates a lot, and for so long I thought it was normal. In the past year, she's threatened to commit suicide three times because we (my sisters and I) said something she didn't like. My therapist has helped me to see that this relationship isn't normal, and it's okay to grieve for the relationship I wanted to have with my mom.

109,03/28/2021,strugglingwithpermissiontoeatafterweightrestoration,butterflygirl27,"my weight has been pretty stable over the past few months and my dietitian said I'm probably at or near my natural weight again. but now I'm struggling with knowing how much I should eat and giving myself permission to eat. when I needed to gain, it was easier. there was no eating too much since I was supposed to be gaining weight and it was a lot easier to give myself permission to just eat whenever I was hungry (was still difficult, don't get me wrong, but easier than it is now). now that I'm supposed to be maintaining my current weight, it's a lot harder for me to justify eating and I'm scared that I'll overeat and continue gaining when I'm not supposed to. I know that if my current weight truly is my natural set weight that everything should regulate and I will naturally maintain this weight, but I have a lot of anxiety so I have been restricting just the tiniest bit lately. I also know that this might not be my natural weight and I don't think I can mentally handle weighing any more than I already do. so basically I feel stuck since I do want to maintain my current recovery weight but I'm just unsure of exactly how much I should be eating and struggle with allowing myself to eat now that I no longer need to gain.",recoveryj,"Mon,03/29/2021-7:52am","You said you’re not sure you could handle weighing more. Would this be different had your dietician not told you that? It seems like that comment was very triggering for you. And I definitely don’t blame you (similar things have been for me too). Try to remember that if this TRULY is the weight your body wants to be, it will not be maintained with ANY amount of restriction. If this is truly the weight at which your body feels good, it will do everything it can to counter any restriction efforts too - meaning that if you restrict now, you may have to start over re-introducing food and regaining regular food/hunger cues and metabolism. I’m so sorry your dietician told you that. The truth is, no one can truly know what weight is “healthy”, ESPECIALLY someone not even living in your body!! Your body knows infinitely more than anyone what it needs and where it feels most healthy. Try to trust it. You never, ever have to “earn” food. Remember that even people in comas need DAILY nutrition! You ARE allowed to eat, and you are allowed to eat in a way that fulfills you, nourishes you, and meets your hunger needs. Believe me, your body will thank you. It sounds like you’ve come so far in recovery. Don’t let this speed bump get in your way. Try to really tune in to what your body is telling you it needs (and if you still don’t have regular hunger cues, follow your meal plan). It could be there’s still some damage that needs healing - healing that will come from adequate nourishment and care. Maintaining weight NEVER means restriction. Ever. Allow yourself to be. And be proud of how far you’ve come in recovery!! Show ED it doesn’t have power over you anymore. Because you deserve all the nourishment and care you and your body need <3",butterflygirl27,"Mon,03/29/2021-3:14pm","to be honest, I'm not sure if I would've thought differently if she hadn't said that because for a while now I've thought of this weight as my natural weight (though I have been slowly gaining over the past three months so I'm really unsure but I want to stop gaining ASAP). Thank you for your response, though. I'm trying not to restrict but it's just so hard mentally because restricting is my default so I have to constantly remind myself that I don't actually want to restrict but then I question what I actually want or if I should be restricting and I guess I'm still just really scared of gaining.",Annet,"Mon,03/29/2021-10:42pm","Trust your body.

If you are already at your set point weight, your body will ensure you do maintain yourself there. There may some slight variations through the month BUT the value will not change much.
I would say explain to your dietician how triggering her comment was for you and ask her to help you counteract it with her knowledge, too. I am sure she will be willing to do so.We should NEVER earn the right to eat. Give yourself permission to eat when your body asks you for food. Your body is wise and will never be wrong.

110,03/02/2021,ReallyWanttoGoBack,yoyokay,"I have been doing pretty well, I guess. Not really beaten the mental aspects of my anorexia but I have been keeping myself fed. Now, I am back to the weight that I hated. I feel disgusted with myself and embarrassed to be out in public or go to work because I get anxious about people seeing my body at its current state. There are nice things about tying to let go of anorexia, like I can socialize with my family more because I am not soley focused on suppressing appetite, exercising frequently for long durations, and limiting food. I also don't have to deal with being shaky from low blood sugar and not being able to draw. I have been able to be a better girlfriend and not hide anytime I needed to eat my limited amounts of food in private or eat at strict times. My general health is not such a scary risk factor, especially with covid anymore (and I was able to get the vaccine). Despite all of the benefits to being at a healthy weight now, part of me still believes that all of that sacrifice is worth it to have a body that I wouldn't feel fat in. Especially with the summer coming up and my history of really shitty summer memories of being embarrassed and having anxiety attacks in a swimsuit. It just felt safer to be the skinniest person in the room.

It’s not an easy journey, and you have such amazing strength to have gotten where you are.
I find that ED thoughts/mindsets are the last to go as far as recovery is concerned. It’s a lot “easier” to tackle the behaviors than the underlying emotions tied to them. Now that you are in a more stable and safe place, maybe it’s time to start exploring that? We all develop EDs for a reason (and it’s never just weight/food). What do you associate with being “fat” or larger bodied? What feelings or emotions does that bring up for you? Would you judge anyone else the way you’re judging yourself? If not, why?
Some of the things I’ve realized for me is that my body image it tied a lot to my experiences as a child of being “too much”.  I was constantly having my feeling/beliefs invalidating and being laughed at or punished for expressing my emotions. Part of my ED was shrinking myself to “take up less space”. What resonates for you when it comes to body image? What do you think you’d achieve if you were in a different body? Is that really related to your body, or is it something deeper that you can approach in a different way?Just some thoughts. Hope you stay strong. You matter.

I remember when I was in the ED I thought my body was like a ""too big sweater"" and I had to continually shrink it to fit the very small version of myself I believed I was. Now in my bigger body, I am learning to recreate myself. It's been two years, but I am at peace with my body now. I take care of her. I listen to her. I experience life in her. But it took time. I felt so disconnected from my body for so long (years before the ED even developed), and honestly never felt I would ever be connected to my body. But I am.
And this isn't to say that there will be a day you love your body. You might not. You might not want to take care of your body. But my hope is that you find peace with your body.
And there are many days I still long for my smaller body. But I know for me it's so much more than just because I want to be thin. It's because I think I need to shrink myself because I'm not supposed to be as buoyant and full of life as I am now.

112,02/21/2021,EncounteringDifficultyinMaintainingRecovery,minigherkins,"Hi, everyone... Just a quick post asking for suggestions on maintaining recovery. It’s been a while since the peak of my eating disorders (severe anorexia) and maybe a year and a half since I last wrangled with other, less severely symptomatic EDs and disordered eating (stringent food rules and scheduling as well as forbidden foods, veganism that started out with noble intentions but quickly became more about control, coping, calories, size, nutrients and weight than the animals and the environment, etc., orthorexic tendencies, purging behaviors, etc.) I started boxing in early 2019 and although I LOVE the sport I have gained a significant amount of mass and weight from all of the strength training and muscle incumbent upon it. I am REALLY struggling with this new body, enough that I have withdrawn from boxing and training and have found myself flip-flopping between crash dieting, purging with laxatives and detox pills,  taking diet supplements, focusing on different exercise methods, etc. and putting forth a real effort in accepting the body I find myself in and eating without restrictions or rules. Some days I’m dismissive of the weight gain, remembering the misery of the throes of the EDs and equally the forced misery of a liquids diet before and after esophageal surgery (not related to the ED, I’ve got esophageal achalasia) and realizing that weight loss for self-acceptance isn’t the answer. However, most days I feel terrified of the body I have now, the weight I’ve put on, and the mass I’ve gained and want to rip all of it off like a snake skin. Any suggestions regarding finding some kind of steadiness or consistency in recovery while resisting the urges to diet, restrict, purge, “cleanse,” etc. would be appreciated. With as much going on in my personal life as I do, often my therapist and I don’t even get to the ED subject week-by-week even though it’s always on our to-do list, lol. Thanks so much and I’ll try to be helpful and available to others as well :-)",horseshoecrab,"Wed,02/24/2021-12:12pm","I'm a serious athlete in a sport that also provides and necessitates noticeable muscle mass, and learning to accept that is definitely something I struggle with. Some days I love it, because really it's way cool to be muscled and powerful and competent, and some days I just want to be skinny and pretty and ""like everyone else.""You say you've stopped training because you're worried about the weight gain -- that breaks my heart. I've thought about doing that on more than one occasion, but in the end I think I love my sport too much to give it up. When I'm feeling gross or frustrated I remind myself of all the reasons that I do it. Of course it's up to you to decide whether you care more about how your body looks or about getting to box, but really try to get in touch with yourself about the answer to that question.I like the metaphor of the snakeskin, ""cleansing"" -- I feel like that too. But really when I'm in my right mind I think our bodies are glorious, strong, powerful -- we may not look like normal people but we can do things those people can't do. I only want to cleanse when I feel fat or dirty, and I just try to remind myself of how wonderful my body is. Maybe when I'm old and retired I will be weak and proportionate and un-muscled, but while my body works I want to enjoy it to the utmost.I don't know, these are just some thoughts I had. I hope at least some of it is helpful, and best of luck to you regardless.",Miggi,"Fri,02/26/2021-10:50pm","I understand what your going through. It is hard to want to have a healthy muscular body but see the numbers on the scale go up, that's really tough. I just try to look at like my body is getting healthier, which is what fueled my anorexia and still does, the need to be 'healthy' and it's healthy to have muscle right? But I honestly understand and relate to everything you are saying. I'd like to see you more on the forum, welcome!",PaulShipmanSmith,"Tue,03/16/2021-7:38pm","You have been struggling with eating disorders - yet at the same time are trying to find stable control.
  There's never an easy way around this situation and it becomes a vicious circle trying to find a 'diet plan' that works.
   Dieting can be like gambling.  It's a constant search for the winning formula - and a costly one at that.  Eating disorders will forever make that search harder.
   It may be helpful to work on your different problems separately, rather than try to solve everything at once.
  You say that you don't get time to discuss your eating disorders with the therapist/counsellor.
  Eating disorders are the result of long-term, ongoing psychological issues that have culminated over a lengthy period of time - so the counselling will benefit more if you can focus on this.
  Of course, Covid restrictions are hindering the provision of these essential counselling services.
  Working through with a counsellor that understands the difficulty surrounding eating disorders will help you to develop a deeper understanding of why you are in this situation.
  The therapy you are receiving at present doesn't appear to give you that direct focus.
  What is happening in your personal life will contribute to the anorexia, so it may be worth preparing for each counselling session prior to your visits (or video sessions).
  This will enable you to discuss the anorexia issues for at least a period of the session or dedicate every other session to specifically discuss the eating disorders.
  When this lockdown ends, a therapist/counsellor who is more experienced in the field of eating disorders and body issues may be more benefit to you.
  With regard to the sports - such as the boxing - this is a case of  being all down to you and seriously asking yourself where you want to go with it.
  The boxing will contribute towards combating your eating disorders and body issues. This is where you could take some self-control in your life.
  You have already proved that you can do it.
  It's often assumed that after a body transformation we become so much happier and more confident in ourselves.
  That eternal yearning for a goal that can never be achieved.  The obsession of wanting to look better, to feel better and for people to compliment and love that new look.
   Somehow, it never seems to work that way.  Many people spend thousands of pounds on eating programmes, surgery, cosmetics and medication to get that perfect look.
  Yet much of this can be achieved by changing how we genuinely feel about - and accept ourselves.  Admittedly, so much easier said than done.  Especially when dealing with an eating disorder.
  Focus on external matters outside the confines of your physical body.  Body and facial changes can be hard to accept -  whatever reason for the change.
  Eating disorders - combined with the body image issues -  will result in further insecurities after a change in physical appearance.
  It's seriously wanting (and training) to ask yourself....""What would I rather do?""....""Would I want to continue this obsession with diet and the body mass, or convert that energy into the boxing?""
  That's why it's important to work on the psychological aspects of eating disorders whilst channelling the physical and emotional energy into your boxing.
   There seems to be four key elements you need to address in order to work your way through - and overcome - your eating disorders.
  Dealing with the psychology of your eating disorders.  Following a healthy eating programme that is continuous and sustainable.  Continuing with the fitness programme and accepting your physical appearance.
  As you have already proven to yourself - you have the ability to follow some form of eating programme.  Have you considered some form of dietary advice, either from a health professional (practice nurse or dietician) or even the boxing gym?
  Many 'diets' are only designed to be temporary, so - due to the constant changing - will not be helpful in your situation.
  You need a full-time, steady (and permanent) eating routine.
  Your eating programme will benefit from reflecting your new found sporting interests and this is again, all about you channelling your energy into this.
  Ideally, a steady and consistent eating programme could be organised between you and an advisor who can accommodate and understand your specialist needs.
  There are also many books available on nutrition for sports, training and exercise which may be helpful.
   Learning to accept your physical appearance is another difficult side effect of eating disorder issues and this is where further counselling will benefit.  It's seriously asking yourself what exactly you want to achieve.
   The boxing will be of more benefit to you - both physically and mentally - if you can  overcome that barrier of fear regarding the physical appearance.
   As you get used to your new look, you'll find the self-acceptance easier.
   Your eating disorders could be related to your esophageal achalasia.
  The condition in itself will have been distressing for you, combined with the surgery and liquid diet.
  This may be worth addressing during counselling.  Physical illnesses can cause distress - especially when we are younger - which can affect us later in life.
   Walking or running can be undertaken whilst you wait for the Covid lockdown to ease (and be able to return to the boxing).
   The training will encourage you to keep focus.
   You may also benefit from further reading about building self-confidence and accepting your physical appearance.  There are many 'self-help' sources available such a books that deal with learning to accept ourselves and our bodies.
  Try visualising the boxing as the 'bigger image' in your mind and the 'target' to aim for.  When those thoughts begin to enter your mind about the body worries - go for a walk or run.
  Concentrate on the gym training, the boxing and reaching towards the goal of developing your interests further.  Make it the bigger, brighter picture.
  You know in yourself that you can move forward and progress with overcoming your problems.
  It's keeping focused on your goals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
113,03/15/2021,WhatHasHappenedToMyBody-Metabolism,barewithme,"Hi All,I've suffered with an eating disorder for over 10 years, starting when I was 17.
I started restricting my food intake-this lasted for about a year or 2 (I was never extremely underweight)I then developed the habit of chewing and spitting my food out (CHSP) starting this was the worst decision I ever made!
I went on with it for 10 years, never eating meals just snacking , and chewing mounds of food in solidarity.During this period my weight fluctuated a lot, I imagine I was taking in some calories from the chewing, so when I wasn't happy with my weight I restricted the chewing (it feels absurd thinking about it)Anyway, I finally reached a breaking point when I was larger in size and the restricting wasn't helping me lose any weight, I wanted to eat normally and be healthy but happy with my body, so I had my resting metabolic rate tested at a university in London.
The results were shocking, my predicted RMR was Xkcal but my actual RMR came back at Xkcal.I was told they had never seen such a low RMR in anyone of my healthy weight (healthy, but in reality I wasn't healthy at all)
How was my body a healthy weight when I wasn't ingesting any meals? And at that point I was chsp on some food.I decided to turn things around and began eating meals along with lifting weights, initially I thought I was putting on weight, but I was reassured but a DR in Australia who specialised in ED and was looking into CHSP, that this was just water weight from what I was taking on. Eventually things levelled out and I dropped the pounds and gained more muscle and I was happy with myself! Even though I lost a couple of pounds I was still a healthy weight (I've never wanted to be incredibly skinny) the only problem was I still wasn't eating enough, I was consuming the amount of calories people would when dieting, or less. Eventually my muscle gains plateaued and slowly the weight crept back on. This was roughly 2 years ago and I'm not entirely sure why - maybe my body got use the the amount of calories, so I  should have continued increasing them.I now eat maybe a little bit more than then, but it is still a considerably low amount of calories yet I am not happy with my weight. I am not over weight and have a normal BMI. I just want to be able to eat a normal amount without gaining even more weight, but I'm scared to.I imagine my metabolism is to blame for this, or for some reason my body is holding onto the fat and not wanting to burn it? (Now I am heavier my recent test showed my RMR is Xkcal)I just can't understand how I am the size when I still don't eat enough. Has anyone else experienced this?Would appreciated any replies and stories if anyone would like to share.
Hope everyone is ok xx Amy",recoveryj,"Mon,03/15/2021-10:48am","Sometimes, when we have been restricting for so long, it takes a long time for the metabolism to normalize. It’s your body’s way of trying to protect you! You said you haven’t been properly eating for 10 years or so, so that’s 10 years your body has been in starvation mode. It holds on to all the nutrients it can get because it knows it’s not going to get any more. It’s working to keep you alive. It’s amazing, albeit terrifying.
It is very common before refeeding to experience extremely low metabolic rates. Honestly, the only way effectively combat this is to allow yourself to eat. I know it’s scary, but the only way you are going to feel good again and help your metabolism is to let go of those restrictions and food rules that have taken your life away for so many years. It will take a little while still; EDs cause extensive damage to our bodies that we can’t see, and we need extra nutrients to help heal and repair. But I believe you can do it. Please reach out to a dietician who specializes in eating disorders. It sounds like the person you saw doesn’t have any education in this area. Someone who is familiar with the recovery process can help you set up a meal plan that honors your body, meets your needs, and help you reestablish a more healthy relationship with food.
Know that we are here to support you in the process!",barewithme,"Mon,03/15/2021-4:00pm","Hi, Recoveryj,Thank you for your reply, I guess that makes a lot of sense! From what I have read when people do the refeed phase, they are underweight to begin with, so when they start eating they end up a normal weight, however I am already a normal weight so I fret that I might end up overweight, have you ever heard of anyone with the same circumstances?Also, do you know whether if my metabolism normalises, will my weight naturally normalize?Thanks again :)",recoveryj,"Mon,03/15/2021-5:27pm","The refeed phase doesn’t just affect those who are underweight - it is the natural step in recovery when there has been restriction. I understand your fear and hesitancies, but know you are not alone. Not only have our EDs conditioned us to fear weight, but society pushes diet culture so hard that it’s sometimes nearly impossible to see the truth. We’ve been sold a lie. Refeeding isn’t just about gaining weight. It’s about healing your body after so much damage caused by restriction. It’s about getting your body to trust you again so you can do the things you want to do and live the way you want to live. It’s about finding a healthy relationship with food that honors your body and your needs.
Have you heard of set point theory? The idea is that our bodies all have a unique weight at which we function at optimally. Only our bodies know that (and it RARELY has anything to do with BMI - in fact, the creator of BMI himself said that it should NEVER be a measurement tool used for health). The body then adjusts its functioning based on how you treat it, the way you move, and the nourishment it receives. Your body is fighting for you. And sometimes, people are healthier at a higher weight than they expect (I know I am!). It takes a lot of grief work sometimes to come to terms with that after society has been manipulating us to believe such harsh lies. But know you are so much more than a number. And you deserve to heal both in mind and body.
What’s the worst case scenario if you do gain some weight? I feel like weight gain is a very small price to pay for physical health, happiness, and food freedom. You deserve a life that’s free from ED and all its control and restrictions. You deserve a healthy, happy body however that looks on you. Because a number can never define you, and a number is never indicative of your beauty.
Again, I would highly recommend seeking out support from someone who specializes in eating disorders. They will be able to address some of your more specific questions. Additionally, it may be a good idea to do some delving into HAES (health at every size).",_admin_moderator,"Mon,03/15/2021-12:36pm","Dear barewithme, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove detailed descriptions of disordered eating behaviors, as well as calorie numbers, which are not allowed on our forums and could be triggering to other users.

114,03/01/2021,Slowmetabolism&trickingyourself,Songbird,Hello everyone! I could really use some advice on slow metabolism due to long term restriction. Ive had severe anorexia since i was 13 and i started real (not forced) recovery at 18. I took to it rather well- all my ocd symptoms faded and i had tons of energy and i was eating a normal healthy diet. Im not even sure when i started restricting again but ive found myself eating a restrictive diet for a while now and its just getting smaller. I seem to justify restricting and blaming my horribly dry skin and extreme tiredness on other things. Silly i know. I am not losing weight which is a good thing. I think my body is in preservation mode. So my fear i guess is that if i start eating like i used to that my metabolism will still be slow and i will gain a bunch of weight while trying to get back to a normal diet. Im sure allot of you have experienced this fear or reality. I want to know how it was for you and how i can start on my way back to a normal diet. Im so tired of being so tired. Im 23 and i feel like a slept years of my life away and its really scary and i want to do better. Any advice is appreciated,Miggi,"Fri,03/12/2021-10:22pm","I understand how you feel. I think back at how I wasted days and days of just lying in bed because I was too weak to stand. I know it can be a struggle, sometimes it feels like you are doing fine and you just start going backwards. But what is important is that you realized you are going backwards, which is the first step to recovery! Now you need to take action! Seek out a therapist to talk to, and maybe consult a dietitian. I want you to know that we are here for you through this recovery journey, and know that it's okay to not be okay. But it's NOT okay to not do anything about it!

Although I was doing a lot better mentally over the past year, I was still restricting to the point where I dropped significant weight. Now, I have moved in with my long term boyfriend, who I have always been better at eating normally around. I knew that moving in with him would help me be able to restore the weight I lost after getting out of treatment. But now it's been a couple of months and I can see and feel the weight coming back. Now that it is actually happening, and my clothes are tighter and my stomach isn't flat, I am starting to panic. Now it's like my behaviors are better- I'm eating plenty- but my mental state is down the tubes.

That takes so much bravery and strength. It is really scary to see and feel the bodily changes that may come with recovery, but know you are not alone.

I know it sounds silly, but I found that getting rid of my “sick” clothes by donating them and then finding clothes that feel good on my recovery body to be very healing.

All of our behaviours. Our body will change, it is for sure but our mind also needs to change. It needs to accept our recovered bodies, our new way of eating, etc.Do not panic. Better donate your ""sick clothes"" and get some new ones. Forget about how you look and instead, focus on how well and energized you have been feeling lately.

119,02/23/2021,howtorecoverfully,cvarovsky,"I suffered from an eating disorder 5 years ago. Until then, everything was fine and I accepted my body until one of my friends after the holidays told me, ""Oh my God, you gained weight."" Then I started to observe my body more and more often, to look in the mirror and finally realized that I hate my body, that I am fat. It was the beginning of my adventure with eating disorders. When it affected my endocrine system, my parents decided to send me for treatment. And yes, everything seemed fine, I recovered from my hormone problems, my period came back, I gained weight. Everyone thinks I'm cured. But no. I am still afraid of gaining weight, I do not want desertion in food, I know how bad it is for my health, but still I do not want to gain weight, I still do not like my body, I want to lose weight I do not want to eat, sometimes I eat unusual portions and then I feel guilty , nervous, depressed and then I promise myself that I will not eat anything. The worst part is that I feel guilty every time. I want to change, but I'm afraid that I can't fully heal myself from this disease, that this guilt will always be in me and it doesn't matter that I know that I don't want to live like this, it's so bad for me, still I go back to eating disorders and these thoughts.

The thing is, we can be recovered for several years, but it only takes one comment or trigger to send us back into that mindset. I can be really hard and restrictive, as you've said. But you can be very proud of yourself for being brave enough to tell your story, that shows a lot of courage. And to get through this disease, you will need courage.

One feels recovered in some ways, and yet the voice of the ED is still very loud at times. Do you ever wish there was something like AA for us? Where you could go to a meeting in those moments of despair, self-loathing, confusions, etc.....for the support and the listening ears? I do.

Since then I've been cramping a lot and I feel bloated, both of which I know are common side effects, but still unpleasant.It's kind of triggering. Menstrual cramps always feel like intestinal cramps to me, so I either feel super full or kind of nauseous, and basically it's screwing up my food regulation. I'm pretty recovered and it's not a huge deal, but still it's annoying. I've basically just told myself that I shouldn't worry about my food intake or weight or anything at all until it passes, because if I start restricting or worse bingeing I'm fairly certain I'll just make it worse. Just wanted to tell somebody that, I guess, and see if anyone had any useful thoughts.Oh, and I bought a NEDA ring online and I've been wearing it basically all the time, and it's comforting :)",weouthere,"Sun,02/28/2021-3:05pm",I got an IUD about a year ago and I remember how uncomfy the first week or so was... just bloated and crampy and so yuck!

However, I still eat so much now. I don't think I can distinguish between what is hunger and what is not.  I restricted yesterday, but I become frustrated because I can't restrict they way I use to.  Before, I'd eat X calories or less. Now, I eat X or more calories! That is way too much and I know it. I have an obsession with mirrors and the scale. Exercise is something that triggers me to feel awful about myself. I fear that when I see my doctor in over a week, she'll tell me I'm too fat and that I need to go on a diet..I'm new to this, so I'm sorry if this is all over the place.

Know that this is normal and you are so not alone! It takes a while for our bodies to regulate hunger/fullness cues again. EDs tend to do a lot of damage and cause our bodies to not trust us to nourish them anymore. It takes a while of providing consistent nourishment to build back that trust. Right now, it also sounds like your body is trying to keep you safe! It’s amazing that you can’t restrict like you used to! That’s your way of working toward full recovery and honoring your body and your needs. REGARDLESS of how much you eat in a given day or even in a meal, you deserve the next snack or next meal. You deserve to eat. Period. Another thing, you said you “know” what you’re eating is too much. Says who? An article in a magazine? How could they *possibly* know what’s right for you and what you need? This also goes back to healing and repair - it takes a lot of energy to repair the damage that EDs do to the body. More energy means more nourishment. And that is OKAY. Your healing is OKAY. Regardless of how it looks. Recovery is not linear, and it can be messy at times. But I promise it’s worth it. You are worth it.
I would highly recommend reaching out to a dietician or therapist who specializes in eating disorders. It sounds like the practitioner you have right now has some pretty biased and insensitive beliefs that don’t actually take you, your health, and your happiness into account. You deserve someone who truly sees you and understands where you’re coming from. You deserve someone who will work WITH you, not against you. Remember, weight is not indicative of either health or wellness. You are more than any number can ever define",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

123,01/27/2021,RecoveringwhenIwasnevermedicallyunderweight,survivingtothriving,"Hey y’all! I guess I just wanted to let off some stuff about this. I’ve recently started recovery and I’m really struggling with the fact that recovery doesn’t always have to mean weight restoration. I feel like every other anorexia/restrictive eating survivor had to go through this long, intense battle of gaining weight back, and although I do have serious medical issues from losing weight and I am at a low weight for my height, I’m not medically unstable enough to warrant having to regain a lot of weight. I think this is because I’m a fairly tall girl (5’7”) and also naturally have a pretty muscular frame, so I don’t lose weight all that easily and I’m just pretty sturdy naturally. It makes me feel really bad because I want recovery, but I feel like I don’t deserve to eat normal amounts as my frame is naturally bigger and I’m not visibly or medically considered underweight. I also feel like people see the whole “naturally bigger frame” thing as an excuse, and I just feel so invalidated in my struggles because I don’t fit the stereotypical image of my disorder. I know recovery looks different for everybody, and everyone’s set point weight is different, but it just hurts knowing that people think I look fine now when I’m not, and that I likely won’t fit the beauty standard when I get back to a healthy weight for me. Urgh. Anyone else with a more muscular/bigger build and AN relate to this? What helped you during recovery? Any words of wisdom or support? Big hugs and best wishes to all of you. <3",imasurvivor,"Wed,01/27/2021-4:04pm","I totally get it, and it stinks.  The world and society thinks that AN means a certain way to look, and being extremely underweight.  I have been all sorts of different weights while struggling with ""atypical"" anorexia nervosa, so titled, only because I didn't fit the criteria of being extremely underweight for my height.  Mine is more due to my psych meds, however.  Regardless, I do comiserate with you and I do understand the frustration.  And it also makes that e.d. voice in our heads scream even louder that we don't need to recover or deserve treatment, etc.  Tell it to SHUT UP!!  It's wrong!!!! You deserve recovery, no matter what size, shape, weight, or anything you are.  You deserve it, because you are you.  I hope this helps.  Take care.",survivingtothriving,"Wed,01/27/2021-4:07pm","Yeah, “atypical” AN is just a whole other ballpark compared to textbook AN- the fact that it’s even a different name is kind of invalidating in itself, honestly. Thank you so much, it’s so nice to just hear people understand. You deserve recovery too, take care, you’ve got this. <3",Annet,"Wed,01/27/2021-10:10pm","Right now, I am underweight but over my course with this illness, I have been at the higher limit of my normal weight. When I reached that weight, everybody (including my first anorexia recovery therapist) thought I was doing perfectly okay. I looked GREAT! However, deep inside, only myself knew I was binging and completely out of control... I had to return to treatment...Weight is just a number. It should never be considered as a diagnosis criteria or to deny anyone's eating disorder.We can be ill at any weight! Eating disorders come in many body shapes, weights and sizes...",kyuxin,"Wed,02/10/2021-5:55am","Hey,
I know exactly how you feel! I myself have a 'normal' body type I'd say (?) but I've been in the binge-restrict-cycle for so many years that it was always getting harder and harder to loose anything when restricting so I never met the diagnostic criteria for anorexia which always made me feel like a fraud and I always said I'd get help once ppl saw I was suffering. But the thing with that is, ppl think of anorexia as a certain body size but actually most sufferers don't look like that at all. Some scientists say that most ppl would DIE before they reached the 'anorexic' weight category. Also, there is a youtuber who has done several videos on ED and recovery and she knows loads of ppl with AN and said most of them for the most part of their ED journey look 'normal' not like the stereotype.
Also, from my own experience: I had almost reached 'anorexic' weight when I visited my mum one day for Christmas (I live by myself in another city and don't see her that often) and she said I looked GREAT despite me being almost at the BMI 'required' to be classed as anorexic. So take it from me, being a low weight DOES NOT equal ppl realizing you're suffering! I almost died last year due to my ED and noone thought I had a problem. Fact is, please don't wait to recover until you get ppl's validation. I know it's tempting and the ED voice screams at you even louder when it's a silent battle but you don't need anyone's validation, your ED is valid whether it's visible or not. And you deserve recovery no matter how you look. I have almost been on the other spectrum waiting almost too long to start recovery and almost passed away without anybody noticing ir validating my struggles.

But AN isn’t measured in pounds or sizes, it’s more in the preoccupation with pounds and sizes and what we do to achieve those. You deserve to eat to recover and overcome your ED—don’t worry about how much to gain, just eat to gain and replenish and care for your body and find your recovery.

124,02/19/2021,Fixationonaspecificperson?,kyuxin,"Hey everyone,
Not sure if this is the right place for this question, but I remember a while ago coming across an article where it said something along those lines:
""Individuals with an ED may also fixate on one specific person in their environment."" I'm not sure what the context of that quote was and I cannot for the life of me find that article again nor do I find anything relating to such a ""symptom"" (if you wanna call it that) anywhere else, hence why I'm turning to you guys. Have any of you ever heard or experienced something like this?
Because I have a very unhealthy fixation with a person in my life which has played a massive part in my ED but I'm not sure if a tendency for obsession is actually common in ED patients - like I said, I couldn't find anything else on that topic so I'm kinda clueless.
Maybe anyone can help me?",jess64,"Sat,02/20/2021-11:54am","Hi kyuxin, I am not sure if that is a common thing or not but I understand what you mean.

Do you have any suggestions or experience as to what helped you if you ever felt like that?",recoveryj,"Wed,02/10/2021-5:56pm","One of the things that helps me sometimes is to take myself out of my own head and remind myself WHY I’m working on recovery. What things bring you joy? What do you want to do? Maybe writing down a list of things that you’d be able to do or be able to focus on in recovery that ED takes away. ED makes us focus ONLY on what it wants. It makes us slaves to the thoughts and behaviors. Think of how much more open and free your life will be without it! You can chase your dreams. Even the little things such as being able to hang out with a friend without constantly worrying about what to eat, what not to eat, exercise, etc. You’ll be able to be present in your own life. Lists like what I’m working toward and what I want to do really help me get a better perspective when things get hard.

I feel sorry you're having a hard time at the moment, I can definitely relate to having poor body image. For me personally, when I feel like that I like to take my mind off things by going for a walk, listening to some music or tending to a hobby I like. I think it's important to remember that you're so much more than your body and even if you don't feel comfortable in it at the moment, remember all the other precious things about your life. I know in ED I didn't have the energy to 'be a person', if that makes sense. I was always just tending to my ED but now in recovery I am slowly discovering the things that make me happy that are not body related, like drawing e.g.
On other days, I feel like actually doing some mild excercise helps with my body image but be cautious here and please don't use that method if you feel like it might trigger you. The way I feel about exercise these days is I like the feeling of using my muscles, I personally find it empowering like ""wow, I'm able to do that!""
Sometimes, it might be helpful to consciously breath, so meditation or yoga can be great tools for calming down.
Lastly, I think it's important to mention that sometimes, no matter what you do, unfortunately you just have a bad day. That is completely normal and not even just ED related, everyone feels that way sometimes. Then maybe just be kind to yourself that day, watch netflix or do whatever comforts you that day and know that tomorrow is a new day and sometimes your struggles with body image really do disappear overnight and you'll wake up feeling much better again!
Hope this helps!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is so hard to find things I want to eat here and my anxiety just has my stomach in knots so eating really doesn't feel good.

134,02/04/2021,I’mrelapsingandIdon’tknowwhattodo...,taupelle,"So I’ve been in recovery for over half a year now. I was in a residential treatment program and graduated from IOP in December. I know I wasn’t ready to leave the program but they wanted me to go anyways. I just recently found a new therapist and psychiatrist, but I don’t click very well with either of them. I don’t feel comfortable enough with my therapist to open up to her about my eating disorder. We’ve mentioned it a few times and she’s aware I have one, but she doesn’t seem to take it very seriously. I’m thinking of switching therapists but it’s really hard to find mental health support where I live. The thing is, I’ve been relapsing for awhile. But within the last week things have sky rocketed. I’ve developed a huge fear over sugar. I’m terrified that I secretly have diabetes and so I’ve been too scared to eat anything sweet. I had my blood taken every week while I was in treatment, so I’m sure they would’ve figured out if I was diabetic. They never once mentioned my blood sugar being too high, however, they did find a handful of other things wrong with me due to my eating disorder. I don’t know what to do, or how to help myself. I’m having panic attacks over carbs and having a lot of anxiety symptoms due to it, which causes me to think the symptoms are actually signs of diabetes. Not to mention, I’ve also developed a fear of sodium and try not to eat anything with too much salt. I’m just really sad and low right now, but I don’t know how to support myself. I never did a relapse prevention plan or anything and I’m just really lost. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",recoveryj,"Fri,02/05/2021-7:42am","I’m so sorry to hear how lost and alone you’re feeling right now. It can be so difficult to switch therapists. But you need to find someone who works with you. If you feel you can’t be open with the one you have right now, how are they going to be there for you and give you the help you need and deserve? Because you DO deserve recovery. You do deserve to be well. If you’re unsure where to look, I’d highly recommend reaching out to NEDA. They can help you locate practitioners in your area.
As far as the restriction and fears go, I know it’s hard when our brains convince us certain essential and valuable nutrients are “bad”. There are no bad foods; everything has a place. I feel like you would really benefit from reaching out and finding a dietician who specializes in EDs. They can help you figure out how to get what you need based on your personal needs. Having a meal plan, while difficult to follow sometimes, can do so much to decrease anxiety. Because then, you can just shut the ED’s voice out and say “nope! This is what I have to do/eat next” and just take the next step. You don’t have to be left to your own devices for food choices (I know that’s been a HUGE anxiety for me in recovery). NEDA can also get you in touch with an ED dietician if you need help there too.
You are not alone. And you deserve to heal. You deserve nourishment, in all forms. Stay strong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of course, I still have things I am working on, including finding clothes I like and finding new ways to exercise that I love. In the past, when I’ve tried to find joy in exercising, it ended up becoming an exercise addiction and leading to relapse.

Now that I have left my gym days behind, I am having trouble finding activities that give me movement and exercise that I actually enjoy. I have tried dancing, which is difficult when I live with 4 people, walking outside (it’s cold now so no), and group exercise classes like yoga (which I can’t do now because of COVID-19).I am thinking about getting a gym membership at a different gym because I used to love lifting, but I am worried I will end up relapsing.

137,02/02/2021,Weightgain/inabilitytoloseweightpostrecovery,ariel0115,"Hi! I am in 'recovery' from restrictive eating habits and intense exercising although I have never formally been diagnosed with an ED. I started becoming uber conscious of food and restrictive around age 15 and went through periods where I was really restrictive versus more 'normal' healthier periods. Shortly after I started becoming more conscious of my food choices (at 15) I lost my period until age 19. Age 19-21 I gained X lbs despite still eating fairly little and exercising. Halfway through being 21 I stopped restricting, have been seeing a nutritionist and am following her caloric target which is above what i used to eat, but is still a 'losing weight' target for someone of my height. Since being 19 (for 3 yrs now) I have been completely unable to lose weight and seem to keep gaining weight. During the last few months I have tried to trust the process and keep hoping my metabolism will sort itself out from the restriction, but its already been almost 6 months and I am stil gaining weight. I am well above a healthy weight/above my pre-ed weight. I know I restricted for a long time but does anyone have experience with how long it will take for things to regulate and my weight to come down a bit / if they ever will?",_admin_moderator,"Tue,02/02/2021-1:38pm","Dear ariel0115, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove weight numbers, which could be triggering to other users.

However, some of us were too young when our disorders started and at 30, 40, 50 or 60 we can not expect our body's set weight to return to the place it was when teenagers. It would be unhealthy. So, better to trust your dietician who will know what the right weight for you is.Will you lose weight? If you really have some extra kilograms and you are eating and working out healthy, of course you will. It will just take some time to your body to get there.",Tryingtoheal,"Tue,02/02/2021-7:59pm","And honestly,  your weight doesn't define you or your beauty.   Your weight is always fluctuating.  It never stays at one set point. That would mean that your body has a set point, one that it's supposed to be at.  You can't control it forever.   And even if you could, will it make and keep you truly happy?  Will you remain truly happy?  Or would weight loss lead you right back here?  Would it ever really be enough, or will it leave you empty, wanting to lose more once you reach whatever the number you want to get to?  A number is just that: a number.  It cannot describe all the wonderful and unique things that come from your soul; the things that make you who you are.
  Perhaps try instead to start coming up with positive qualities about yourself.   It might just start with one if that's all you can think of at the moment.   Tape that on your mirror or whatever you look at everyday.  You may struggle to believe it in the days to come; it may take a month.  Then try to think of another positive quality.   Then repeat.
  Eventually,  you will start believing these things.
  A Bible verse I like is Ecclesiastical 3:22

It can be difficult to tell how much damage EDs have done to our bodies because so much is internal. I know that especially in the beginning, the body is trying to get as much nutrition as it can just to survive and repair the extensive damage that was done. I know trusting the process is terrifying and can even be painful at times. But know you are so not alone. And know that the more you lean in and give your body what it wants and needs, the more it will heal. The less you count, the less you restrict, the more your body will settle and trust again. It’s a process that does take time. Think of it like rebuilding a relationship after trust was broken - it’s going to take a while, and it’s going to take work. But I know you can do it. And you are so worth it. You deserve to be healthy, happy, and free from ED.
If you have specific concerns, I’d highly recommend talking to your dietician. They know the “numbers” and can better answer those questions than any of us here. That said, I know that I’ve been doing a lot of research lately on what makes a “healthy” diet or “healthy” weight, and all the research points to that what we’ve learned about numbers, BMI, etc over the years is completely wrong. BMI wasn’t even made by a doctor. It was a eugenicist mathematician and has absolutely NOTHING to do with health. Also, everyone’s diet looks different because every single body has different needs! I know I need more of certain nutrients than others and others need different ones more than me.  I know it feels wrong to be eating “normal” meals after restricting for so long, but try to trust your dietician has your best interests in heart. They are just trying to give your body the energy and nutrients it needs to not just survive, but heal and thrive.",ariel0115,"Wed,02/03/2021-4:27pm","Thank you for the support and for the advice. I have spoken to my dietician although she says she has no idea how long it will take.

I'm new around here so please excuse me if I make any mistakes or if this topic has been talked about already.
But I have recently started to actively recover so this is all still very new to me. I also do it on my own, so I get overwhelmed quite easily. For example, today, one of my co-workers pointed out I had gained weight. I'm not sure if he meant it as a joke but I do know I have obviously gained weight since starting recovery and this comment really triggered me.
How do you react to such comments, especially when they come from people who don't know about your ED history?
I'm really scared of those comments now so every help would be greatly appreciated.",Annet,"Mon,01/25/2021-10:47pm","Welcome to the forums!

In my opinion, it is not appropriate to comment on anyone’s body, especially in the work environment! Maybe establishing some boundaries with this individual may be helpful? For example, you could say something like “I don’t appreciate people commenting about my body. There are far more interesting aspects about me that I’d rather talk about” or “I find it very rude to comment on someone’s body, even if your intent isn’t negative. I will not be objectified by you in this way. If you are trying to start a conversation, perhaps pick something more interesting like weekend plans or what TV shows I’m watching”.
Just some ideas. I think setting boundaries around comments about people’s bodies is extremely important, and not just for people with EDs.

I have gotten so far with my recovery, I feel much better, I can focus on my life, my weight and what I eat doesn't bother me anymore. A little background on my eating disorder, I was an anorexic when it started, but after two years, as I was losing weight, I got hungrier and hungrier, and so I became a binger, I would binge on a few different foods and in that period I became a bulimic, and things got out of control. I was stuck in that cycle for so long, and I decided to finally seek recovery. I was on antidepressants and all  that things, and so I feel much better. I have one thing that still reminds me of that part of my life, which is why I'm writing. Since my recovery, I don't control myself over what I eat, but once a week since I started recovery, I overeat. It used to be really big quantities of food, but now I'd say it's just the size of one extra meal. The eating itself doesn't bother me, but what bothers me is that I'm tying this habit to my past bingeing and purging, like a leftover of that habit. The thing is I can even recall of this habit even before my eating disorder, it is what brought me to my eating disorder, because I was aware of this behaviour but I didn't know hot change it, I was around 13 when I remember it first started happening.

Additionally, it may take a little while for regular hunger cues to return. Know that that is normal and part of recovery as well. When we begin recovery, our bodies try to get in a lot of nutrition both because of the repair work and also because our bodies are afraid we’re going to starve them again. The more you nourish yourself and give your body what it wants and needs, the more it will begin to trust you again.

Because of that, her team dropped her. Her insurance is awful and she's having trouble advocating for herself by herself. Her family is uninvolved and not many of her friends understand eating disorders. I can tell she is starting to give up and give into dying. I am terrified for her.Would involuntary commitment be an option here? Would it get her to treatment quickly enough (she could literally die any minute)? How does that work with insurance?

I've been begging her to go the hospital, call treatment centers, scrap together a new team, and I trust her to do those things, I just don't know if it'll happen in time because her ED is minimizing the situation.Obviously this is not an ideal solution and I'd hate to do it to her, but she is about to die. I feel so helpless.",recoveryj,"Thu,01/21/2021-10:25pm","I’m so sorry to hear about your friend. It is truly heartbreaking to see someone we love struggling like that.
It sounds like the best option for your friend right now would be to go to the medical hospital. Even though they often don’t address eating disorders, they could at least get her medically stable so she has time to find a good treatment program. That’s what happened to me in a way. I was lucky enough though that the hospital I went to had a unit for patients with EDs, so they could help me in that way too. Maybe see if there’s a hospital around that has a dual treatment like that? If not, it is most important to address the physical so she can get to a point where she is able to pursue treatment and recovery.
NEDA may be able to help you find hospitals, programs, and providers in your area if you give them a call.
I hope you’re able to take care of yourself during this difficult time. Remember, you matter so, so much. I hope both you and your friend are able to find help and healing

145,01/09/2021,Triggeredbylosingweightwithoutintendingto?,louise21,"Hi everyone, A bit of background: I'm in my mid-20s. I've never been diagnosed with an ED but I severely struggled with eating and body image for many years and finally came to a point where I couldn't do it anymore. I realised things had to change because I had been so anxious, obsessed, miserable and preoccupied about controlling my food and weight, and it just felt like a never-ending, toxic cycle. So, around 8 years ago I decided to do recovery on my own. I stopped dieting (with one ""relapse"" a few years in, when I thought it was ""different this time"" and... well it really wasn't), I pushed myself to accept that weightloss is in most cases not something to aspire to, and I stopped weighing myself for the most part (except for dr appointments, and every few months when I was curious tbh. Not necessarily a good decision). My weight fluctuated and got to an all time high then over the years went back down and stabilised. In that time I've put great emphasis on surrounding myself with images of people of all sizes and looks and found great beauty in it. I've spent a long time thinking and recalibrating why I ate a certain way, why I exercised or not... it's been hard but, long story short, I think for the past year and half I've found that things have gotten so much easier and I'm not preoccupied with what I eat at all. I eat how I want, and I've figured out how to exercise in a way that doesn't feel triggering. I let my body guide my decisions so much more and I've found this natural balance that feels very similar to my easy relationship with food and body when I was a child. Anyway, in the meantime, without trying, I also lost weight. For some weeks, I was feeling my clothes getting too baggy and wondered if it's because I need to throw all my jeans in the wash, so a couple of days ago I stepped on a scale out of curiosity and found out (not with little excitement) that my weight dropped to a number it hadn't reached since my early teens. And now I feel very ambivalent about this. In my head, I've learned to celebrate bodies of all sizes, and truly find them beautiful. And I liked my body when it was heavier. In my head I know that I'm ok with gaining weight again and I do expect it, too. But seeing that number on a scale just has made me a bit anxious and kinda triggered me for the past couple of days. I keep talking myself through it, ""Am I ok with getting back to the weight I last knew I had? Yes. I have plenty of clothes I want to wear at that heavier weight. I like my body then. I like it now. It really doesn't matter."" But it's kind of an intrusive thought: ""are we gonna keep going down? the exercise you've been doing regularly, we're gonna really have to keep sticking to it now"" etc. It's getting me ""in my head"" about things that had become very intuitive to me. I think I'll be fine, and I have to remember to stay close to my body and my intuition - and stay away from the d*mn scale - and it'll pass, hopefully sooner than later. I guess my question is... Has anyone else experienced this? Losing weight without intending to and struggling with it?Best,
Lou",jess64,"Sat,01/16/2021-11:31am","Hi Lou, Hope you are doing well. Just wanted to comment in some support. I definitely relate to what you are saying, I think it’s really hard to overcome the satisfaction of weight loss even if you are comfortable at any size and you love your body at any weight. We are all constantly told that weight loss = good and it definitely becomes internalized! You seem to have a wonderful view on your thoughts though and it is so great that you are able to separate that thought and acknowledge it is not a good one. But, I think it is also super normal for you to have it stuck in your head as well. I have that too when I notice clothes fitting differently and just have to remind myself of all the things you mentioned – that it doesn’t matter, that I have clothes that look great on me, and that I like my body. I am glad you posted and am here to support and relate! Sending love and hugs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
146,01/09/2021,Relapsing,zofia,"Hello, I'm new to the forum. I'm sorry for how long this post is going to be... I'm 19 and I've considered myself to be recovered for about a year. My eating disorder didn't last very long, because I quickly received help (therapy and small dose antidepressant medication), but it was still quite intense and very damaging for me. I started to starve myself when I was 16/17, which was partly a coping mechanism for my feelings of horrible loneliness and self-hatred, partly a suicide attempt, and it quickly became an eating disorder. My life turned around completely after I started going to therapy and taking meds and after I managed to make friends. I gained A LOT of weight over the summer last year, compensating for all the kilograms that I've lost, but I dealt with it quite well,though I still took my medication and went to therapy for another year. I stopped doing both of these things around September this year, because, despite the covid situation, I was feeling well. I was also excited because of the start of my first year at university. Unfortunately, lately things have seemed to be going downhill. I've been struggling to find any motivation that I need to actually study - because of that I feel as if I hadn't learned anything and continuing to try seems pointless sometimes. I don't even know why I chose this particular major anymore, all I have to learn seems worthless to me now. On some days I feel overwhelmed by feelings of hopelessness and then I might struggle to get out of bed, take care of myself, let alone study. And obviously, with the pandemic and usual lack of time, I rarely see any of my friends. I chat with some of them and try to keep in touch, but lately I've become growingly disgusted with myself, which makes me feel like I should stop bothering other people and cut ties with them. I've already had a time latelt when I deleted my social media for around a week and did not contact with anyone, but, obviously it just makes me feel worse. That's obviously when the ed comes in. I've been feeling worse and worse about myself for a few months now, but I think it became even worse around a month ago and some of my old habits seem to be coming back. As it was two years ago, it started with several days of fasting and these were the days when I didn't feel motivated enough for anything. From time to time there were days when I had sudden surge of energy or motivation, but most of the time everything seems to be painfully chaotic, unorganized, it seems like I'm not doing anything to change it and I know that I'm just so awfully pathetic and disgusting. I've started to restrict again, though I wasn't as successful in it as I wanted to be. Eight after Christmas I was left alone at home after my family went away for a week or two and once again I was using restriction and fasting as a way of punishing myself, creating order  in my life or something. I'm starting to feel like I'm not able to keep going without heavily restricting, though i think it's different from what it used to be. I only wanted to do this for a day or two, maybe more, and then it would be over, but I'm not any less angry at myself. I've binged multiple times over these days and it makes me even more angry at myself. It makes me want to restrict even more, even though I am aware, that hunger is the reason for binging. But I started to feel discomfort after eating anything, like something is not right, and something is telling me that maybe this is the only way to make things right and to make life livable. I'm so angry at myself most of the days, but this seems like compensating for everything that I do incorrectly and all the ways in which I am incorrect. I don't want to relapse though. I don't want to lose as much weight as I did two years ago - I feel worse about my weight than I did a few months ago, but I don't want to destroy my body like this again and most of all I don't want anyone to worry about me. This is the main reason why I'm concerned about this, really, that I don't want to upset other people. I not that my grandparents would be horrified if this happened. I'm also worried about my sister. She has been the first person to notice anything two years ago and yesterday she accidently saw my notebook with all my meals and calories written down. She didn't tell anyone else, but she got very angry at me. I obviously told her that it only happened for a few days,but I'm okay. I don't know though. After I talked to her I felt like I really need to start eating normally and regularly again, but right after that all the thoughts that I had had before came right back to. I don't know if I'm going to bear all of this without having some form of restriction. I don't know why, but it's hard for me to convince myself otherwise. Nothing happens z really, but that just makes it seem worse. Days just pass and I don't even notice. Everything seems so chaotic and I can't make anything right. My friend has recently suggested that I could go back to therapy, but I don't think it's a good idea. I don't think it is going to help me in any way right now, my parents will have to pay for it again (I don't have a job yet, I intended to get one, but I'm already not able to deal with my upcoming exams and probably too dumb even for my worthless major). And as I said, I haven't even lost weight and I keep eating too much in the end. Whenever I try to talk to someone, I realize that everyone is struggling,especially now, during the pandemic. It makes me feel like I don't need any more help than others do. I might feel better tomorrow or several days from now. Sometimes I end up convincing myself that I only do everything for attention and I deserve to beat myself up for it. Again, I'm sorry for making this overly long. I guess I just needed to get some things of my chest, but maybe I should've kept it shorter.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,01/10/2021-11:58pm","Hi zofia, welcome to the forums.

What matters is how we confront those times. It’s okay to ask for help. In fact, you DESERVE help. You deserve to live a life that’s more than this. Maybe it is time to get back into therapy. I know a lot of people who have been struggling this year, but that does not make your pain and your struggles any less valid. You MATTER. If finances are a problem, NEDA can help you find low-fee therapy in your area. You are deserving of love and care. You don’t have to “hit rock bottom” to seek help. You are always worthy. I would highly encourage you to reach out. I find that EDs can take over so much of our lives; it can even talk us out of getting therapy! But that’s its way of keeping us in its grasp. I know your family and friends care about you so much and would want you to get the help you need. You matter. And you are worth it. You are not alone",clarabd,"Wed,01/13/2021-9:17pm","I’m so sorry you’ve been struggling. I went through pretty much exactly the same thing about a year ago and I know how hard it is to get better again. I think it’s a good sign though that you don’t want to relapse because it means you’re fighting against your ed and it shows how strong you are. I know you don’t want anyone to worry about you, but the truth is they probably already know you’re not okay and telling them will actually make them feel relieved that you’re working to get better again. And you need your support system to help you heal. You don’t have to fight this alone. Your sister was probably only angry because she loves you and hates seeing you in pain and hurting yourself.I really think you should consider going back to therapy. You said you don’t think it will help you but remember that you can always try a different therapist or approach to therapy if your first one didn’t quite work for you. Sometimes you just need to find somebody who understands you better.  Your disrupted eating patterns could also be part of the reason why your mood is so all over the place so getting better will help that too. Just because you’re not losing weight doesn’t mean you’re not sick and I can tell you that you aren’t making a huge deal out of nothing or just doing it for attention. You’re absolutely not pathetic or disgusting either. Please don’t make your ed seem small. Just because other people are struggling doesn’t mean you don’t matter. You’re worth so much. And you deserve to be happy. Look after yourself, get help and get better :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
147,01/11/2021,I'mRelapsing,YouAreWhatYouIs,"Hi, i'm 18 years old and I have been out of any inpatient care for around 4 years now, though recently (over the past month or so) my restrictive eating has been getting a lot worse. My parents don't know about it but they seem to have realised that i'm not ok, though I think they think it's linked to general stress around school and the pandemic. I'm not sure how I should go about getting help, and given that i'm 18, i'm not sure how the transition from child to adult mental health services works.
I'd really appreciate any advice.",weouthere,"Mon,01/11/2021-10:59am","Hi!! Thanks for reaching out to the forums, you’ve already taken a huge step towards getting yourself help, so congrats on that. I would say in your situation, the best thing to do is let your parents know that you’re struggling again, as they can be a great resource to get you some professional help. If they have insurance, they can help pay for things as well. Everyone’s situation is different of course, so if you are not planning on telling your parents, being 18 has it’s benefits. You can seek out a therapist or dietitian through NEDA or another website and tell them that your parents are not involved and you do not have insurance (that is essentially what I did). In this case, if you do this without your parent’s help, it gets a lot more expensive and difficult to manage on your own. My advice is to do some research and figure out what type of help you think would be best for you (adulthood is all about trusting your intuition!), whether that is inpatient, outpatient, or an outside therapist. Then, when you’re ready, confide in your parents and show them the resources you have found so they can help you figure out what you can afford and what is the most manageable for your family. I wish you all the best of luck in your recovery and beyond!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
148,01/05/2021,Needabitofhelp,jennahugs,"Although my weight has been safe for a long time, I’ve gradually let things slip a bit through the pandemic. If I’m honest with myself, I need to eat better in order to live the life I want to. I’m able to function and carry out all the essentials, but not have a very fulfilling or enjoyable life.
My job is not especially strenuous and I do it well, yet on my days off I’m completely exhausted, I get nothing done that I plan and I feel miserable/irritated/useless.
Much as it can feel so normal and right, I’m tired from this way of life. I know I need to do something about it, but I’m just so scared of:1. Clothes becoming too small

149,12/19/2020,homefortheholidays,horseshoecrab,"I'm a freshman in college, just moved out this fall and I'm back home now for the holidays.Change is hard -- I'm struggling to get readjusted and I'm binging as a way to deal with that. I think. I've gained some weight. I do body-weight exercises and I'm a very serious athlete, so I'm also not as strong as I used to be. Plus I'm taking a little time off for the holidays, or not pushing as hard, or something. Which is good... but yeah :(I've had anorexia, I went to the hospital, my parents know about that. Now I've been trying to not eat, because I'm not hungry or to purge after binging, and they say stuff like, ""Should we be worried this is the anorexia again? No, wait, you're clearly not underweight so it's not a problem.""Needless to say this is not a helpful statement. I know EDs happen in all bodies, I know. I miss being anorexic, though, because it was a)obvious to other people that there was a problem and b)felt better -- that was control, this is just fat and out of control and stuff like that. I haven't actually purged, like thrown up yet. But I really want to, sometimes -- it would make some things easier. I get close, and then I don't because I know how bad that is for you medically.But I think binging and having too many calories is bad too. I can't restrict anymore, I don't know why. My body won't let me go back to having bad anorexia, which I guess is a good thing but maybe not. I can't even really overexercise right now, so it feels like purging is the only way out. I want to have good holidays, I don't want to be worried about all this crap right now. I weighed myself for the first time today in seven (?) months...

150,12/30/2020,severeanemia5yearsintorecovery,MeowMeow,"Hey everyone,I'm new here.  I struggled with anorexia all through my teenage years.  For the past 5 years I have been weight-restored and behavior free.  I have never received professional help.Due to some complications, I went 3 years without seeing a doctor.  But just last year I got a physical and was due for blood work.  They found that I was severely anemic and sent me to the emergency room, where they decided I was stable enough not to require a blood transfusion and instead prescribed me iron supplements.  Within a week after I started taking the pills, I noticed a HUGE energy difference.  And after a couple months, I noticed that my hair was growing in much darker, thicker, and curlier (the old hair looked almost blond and the new hair was brown).My doctor ordered a bunch of tests to try to figure out the cause of the anemia (looking for various sources of internal bleeding) and all came back negative.  After describing my periods to her, she said they didn't seem heavy enough to explain such severe anemia.I am wondering if the anemia was caused by my ED history.  It just feels strange that such a severe mineral defficiency could still happen after eating normally for several years.

I have struggled with eating issues on and off since the age of 14... I am now 27. Before covid existed and we were put into lockdown my issues with food was stable since the age of 20. Lockdown happened... I felt I put alot of weight and lost control of my freedom and life. Summer began and I needed to take back that control so my bulimia started again, excessive calorie counting and over exercising. Recently, I had an accident and when at the hospital I realised what effects I was doing to my body on the inside.... So I knew I needed to make a change. Since the accident I have really been trying and am currently 23 days of not purging and only excercising once or twice a day and trying to be slightly more relaxed with what I eat. However, after being told we are now in teir 4, I can feel that control going from me again... I am trying so hard to not let it affect my progress but its so hard particularly this time of year when food and drink is a huge part of everything more so than ever really when you can't go out. I don't really know the purpose of writing on here I just thought I would give it a try. I always feel a burden to my friends if I open up about my feelings and my family just don't understand.",jennahugs,"Wed,12/30/2020-3:04pm","Hello Hjsg123 - well done for reaching out, it can be daunting the first time. You’re story sounds so similar to mine! I’m 28. I’m sure there are more people who can relate to at least some of what you’re going through. It can be hard when family don’t understand and for me it’s hard to know what to say without upsetting them/causing arguments.
I was also thrown off guard by being put into tier 4. One of my first thoughts was, “all my structured exercise has stopped, I’m going to get so fat” or “I’m going to be stuck at home with my ED thoughts and getting fatter and fatter...”
Christmas can be a struggle for me because of the food obligations/pressure; I don’t have the answer for how to stop that entirely, but knowing that ED likes to blow things out of proportion helps me; eating differently at a certain time of year is not going to make a lot of difference, so many people do it. Having the fears/anxiety in the first place often produce “feeling fat” and poor body image. I hold onto that.
What I’ve been working on is finding ways to take back that sense of control, in order to prove the ED thoughts wrong and give myself an alternative to destructive behaviours. I’m using tier 4 guidelines as an opportunity to practise enjoying my own company at home and changing my perspective on myself. Taking up new peaceful hobbies/skills, sticking to an enjoyable but moderated exercise plan, having phone calls with a friend about silly non-ED things, keeping my house clean and tidy, reading, journaling, guided relaxation/meditation... they’re all things that ED behaviours will get in the way of and I don’t want that. And they get in the way of ED thoughts, especially over time, which is what I want.
It sounds like you’ve been through such a lot. Maybe this is an ideal time for you to really make time for yourself to feel more peaceful. I try not to view what I’m going through as “ED recovery”, more like “Lifestyle change and self-love development”
Keep reaching out if you need it. Loads of love :-)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
152,12/26/2020,DelayedphysicaleffectsofEDwhileinrecovery,morgs1191,"Looking for insight into a particular issue that has come up for me recently. I have been in recovery from anorexia for about 5 years. I have settled into a decent relationship with food & have not restricted in quite some time. This fall has been particularly stressful and triggering for me for a lot of reasons, & I’ve noticed thoughts of restricting becoming more frequent. While I’m not actively engaging in that behavior, I am experiencing a LOT of nausea. I’m struggling to eat normal meals or eat on a regular schedule. I’ve talked with my doctor and there doesn’t seem to be any obvious physical indication for the nausea, so my mind immediately goes to my ED. I haven’t found much information on this, so I’m wondering if anyone has experienced this? It’s a weird experience where I am not consciously relapsing, but it feels as if my body doesn’t want me to eat. Am I going crazy?",recoveryj,"Mon,12/28/2020-9:11am","You are definitely not alone. A lot of times, stress and high anxiety can cause physical issues like nausea. It show a lot of self-awareness that you’ve been trying to get on top of this as soon as possible. You truly do have so much strength.
Does your doctor know your ED history? It may be helpful to bring that up. It could lead them in the direction to help give you the support you need and deserve. Sometimes, they can help you can on an as-needed anxiety medication or into therapy to help you navigate the stressors and triggers. I would definitely recommend seeking out a therapist if you don’t already have one. Often times, there are underlying issues behind ED feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. A therapist can help you process all that’s going on without resorting to maladaptive coping mechanisms. You deserve to heal <3",MeowMeow,"Wed,12/30/2020-1:42pm","I have been 5 years behavior free from anorexia, and I totally understand what you mean.  Something similar happened to me last year, when I had a really bad bout of anxiety/OCD that made me so nauseous I could barely eat for a few days.  At least for me, the anxiety causing the nausea wasn't directly ED-related, but it was indirectly related in that it was caused by a feeling of losing control.  What I try to do in times like these is meditate, do deep breathing, and drink hot beverages like tea because it calms me.  Then I try to make myself eat at least a little bit even I'm still feeling somewhat nauseous, because (a) I know my anxiety will only get worse if my body/brain is deprived of nutrients and (b) I don't want to let myself slip back into restrictive behavior.  When I feel like a full meal will upset my stomach, I try to stick to small, frequent snacks.  I also try to eat slowly so I can pay attention to how the food is feeling in my body.Hope you start feeling better.  Good luck <3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
153,12/22/2020,CanIhandlethisonmyown?,This.is.life,"Hello,
I had an eating disorder as a teen and was in treatment and recovering since I was 18. I would say I was in a very good spot when I met my now husband. We had our first child when I was 21 and after ended treatment. He never really saw me struggle outwardly with my eating. I did have small lapses every once and a while. But I was always able to get back on track on my own.Fast forward to now (42) I have put on some weight. I had full
Intentions of losing a little weight and becoming more healthy the right way. But my mind reverted back to eating disordered thinking.
In 3 months I have dropped a noticeable amount of weight but am not yet at a “normal” Weight for someone my height. I am trying to be healthier with my eating habits and lose the last bit “the right way” but I can’t get  my head to stop telling me the faster ways to get there. And unfortunately I have not been able to stop doing the eating disorder behaviors.I really don’t want to discuss this with my family I would rather deal with this myself. It’s only been a few months I should be able to turn this around myself, right? I think the reason it’s so hard right now is because I am not yet at  a normal healthy weight. Once I get there I think it will be a lot easier to stop. Does that  make sense? I mean I don’t want to be underweight. I remember how I felt then and I would never want to go back.

Was in a similar spot a few years ago, and it was really stressful going alone (for MONTHS I tried to knock it off by myself- even after I reached my ‘goal weight’ the patterns were entrenched), and when I FINALLY reached out to a therapist I was like “WHY did I not do this sooner?!?!” If you’re close with family it might work to be open with them, but they are likely no substitute for professional help. Therapists can be great partners too if you’re trying to lose weight in a ‘healthy’ way for the first time in awhile. They can help you stay accountable to your true goal: health.

Mostly, I’m just exhausted. I’m able to keep most behaviors at bay, but I haven’t been able to really make progress for a while. I’m not getting worse, which I guess is good, but it’s frustrating and discouraging to feel so stuck too. I’m still trying though. And making it through each day as best as I can. Which is what I guess we’re all kind of doing at this point...I don’t know. It’s hard to be hopeful sometimes. But I know I have to keep going, so I guess for now, that’s how it’s going to be.

I struggled with bulimia too, and its so hard to get out of the constant thought about food, especially when you don't have anyone to talk to about it, and if you that conversation seems impossible. Some things that helped be were meditating before binging. It really helped when I felt like I had no control. Also, when I was going through this, I only had my sister to talk to, but I didn't want to give every detail or have a long conversation about it. Advice from my therapist was to have a code word when I felt a binge coming on and telling my sister. Or just simply saying ""I feel really overwhelmed and can't stop thinking about food."" But even having the code word, my sister was able to know what was going on and distract me. Even when sometimes I'd get angry or annoyed at her, or it would be really hard to talk about or put into words, I reminded myself that it was my eating disorder getting mad, and not me.

156,12/19/2020,"Anxietyovermealplanning,causingfamilyarguments",taupelle,"Hey all! So I struggle with finding recipes and making meal plans. I’ve had my eating disorder for so long that I honestly have no idea what foods I enjoy and have a hard time figuring out if I don’t like a food or if it’s my eating disorder that doesn’t like it. This causes a lot of trouble in finding recipes because I have absolutely no idea what to look for. My dietician suggested making meal plans with my mother, since I live at home and we cook dinners together. I was a little worried about the idea because my mom and me used to get into huge arguments over what I wanted to eat and it’d usually result in her storming out of the room telling me to just not eat anything. Today I finally worked up the courage to ask my mom if she’d make a meal plan with me. She got a little annoyed but said fine. While we were looking for recipes she was clearly annoyed and sighing a lot. Every time I told her that a recipe didn’t sound good she’d roll her eyes and get loud. It was obvious I was annoying her and I was starting to panic a little. Finding recipes is already hard as it is and she was making it even harder. After me declining a couple of recipes she got annoyed and slammed the recipe book closed. She told me she would just find the recipes on her own. I explained to her that I needed to be apart of finding the recipes for my recovery; plus we have very different tastes in what we like to eat so I knew I probably wouldn’t enjoy her recipes. She continued to get annoyed and it led to an argument. Instead of arguing back I started to have a panic attack and cry, I was going to walk away and go to my room. But she got mad and started yelling at me to come back. I explained to her that this was already something that’s super hard for me to do and I asked her for help in hopes that it would be easier. She said fine and we continued to find recipes together. We just finished our meal plan a little bit ago. I could tell my mom was upset with me so I apologized for having a panic attack, she said it’s fine and went outside to smoke. I’m kind of annoyed because I really don’t feel like I was in the wrong here. I tried my best to remain calm with her and not raise my voice despite having a panic attack, but she continued to push me. She couldn’t even be bothered to apologize to me for yelling and acting like a child. I’m sorry if that sounds rude but I’m just super annoyed right now. I don’t have a lot of support in my recovery and my mom is really the only person I can rely on right now. From now on I’ll probably just make the meal plans on my own, because it’s honestly less stressful that way. If anyone has any advice on how they manage to find recipes they like I’d really appreciate it!! It’s probably one of the top things I’m struggling with right now.",recoveryj,"Sun,12/20/2020-9:02am","I’m so sorry for how your mother is treating you. You were definitely not the one who needed to apologize in this situation! Her behavior was incredibly rude, uncaring, inappropriate, immature, and disrespectful. You are incredible for how you handled the situation and your persistance moving forward in recovery.
I definitely understand being overwhelmed with meal plans and food choices. That is a big struggle of mine as well. Are you currently working with a dietician? I would highly recommend finding one that specializes in eating disorders. The NEDA helpline can help you find resources in your area! One of the first things my dietician did for me was create a flexible meal plan and give me a list of foods/recipes I could try to fill in the spaces! It provided so much structure and just got the ground under my feet while still allowing me to explore the foods I actually do enjoy.

158,12/17/2020,Smallvictories,mflo520,"Recovering from an eating disorder feels like such long path. But, each milestone is important to recognize. Being faced with having to eat every single day makes it that much harder. Does an alcoholic go to a bar and have the willpower to not have a drink when they’re in the process of being sober? No. They wouldn’t go. Because that willpower is something maybe superman could only have. But with us, we’re faced with food everyday of our lives, as something we can’t survive without. When you’re addicted to food, or counting calories, exercise, restricting, etc., every day in recovery feels like a constant battle.That’s why it’s so important to count the milestones no matter how small. I’m talking about having breakfast when you’re hungry. And eating that snack, even though you’re in between meals and you’re scared of having to “burn it off.” Or eating a slice of pizza because you want to! As I type this, I wonder what its like to have freedom with food, and hope to get there one day. But, this morning, I woke up and just ate breakfast. No workout, no need to earn it. It was great, and I had a fantastic day at work. I don’t know if this sounds relatable to anyone, but I appreciate these accomplishments every day because in the worst of my eating disorder, they didn’t ever seem possible. I never even believed I could watch a show on Netflix in its entirety without having intense anxiety about binging/purging. Now, I binge watch shows without a problem! Not sure if that’s the healthiest alternative, but hey, it’s a start! It’s so important to get help and talk about this stuff, because a life controlled by your eating disorder is no life at all. Its mean to you, and doesn’t allow you to see the beauty in life or yourself.  Food freedom leads to so much more freedom in life. The two are interchangeable in my opinion. That being said, it’s tough and definitely not linear, but these small accomplishments make it worth it. I hope to be completely recovered one day, but for now, I’ll continue to celebrate these small victories.",horseshoecrab,"Sat,12/19/2020-9:40pm","It's beautiful.

159,12/18/2020,Whenyourweightbecomesalegitimatehealthconcern,healthyaspirations,"This is my first time posting here. I've never been officially diagnosed and honestly never sought treatment because I was too ashamed. I have a history of restricting and over-exercise when I was younger and since then, binge eating periodically. I've had an unhealthy preoccupation with food since childhood.I'm middle-aged and recently have started having heart and blood pressure problems. (I'm still young for that). I've mostly avoided dieting for about 10 years. I attempted about a year ago and had to stop because I started immediately back with the obsessive behaviors. However, I am medically obese and I know my weight is a genuine risk factor for my heart. I feel like I'm in a difficult situation trying to choose which aspect of my health I should focus on and really wanting to be able to both get to a healthier weight because I genuinely need to, and not getting into that viscous eating then compensating cycle.I've started looking into dieticians who specialize in eating disorders, but I don't know that I currently qualify for an ED diagnosis, and it seems like most programs require an assessment and intensive treatment, which I'm not sure that's what I even want.I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and how they approached it. Thanks so much.",recoveryj,"Sat,12/19/2020-8:58am","First of all, congratulations for all the hard work you’ve put into recovery. It can be so difficult, especially when it feels like society is fighting against us.
Maybe see if you could disclose having issues with ED in your past to the dietician? If they are trained in eating disorders, they should know that seeking help with food is difficult and be open to working with you.
There are also many other things you can do to support your health without focusing on food/weight. I am not a doctor, but I know that there are steps you can take to help you stay healthy. I would highly recommend finding a doctor that specializes in HAES (health at every size). That would definitely be a good place to start.
Best of luck. I’m rooting for you <3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I frequently have intrusive thoughts about overall heart health, specifically about getting clots in my arteries/having a heart attack if don't exercise enough/eat less of X or Y. For example, I will feel guilty for spending too long sitting, and I will think about how sitting for long periods of time could be impacting my cardiovascular health. I also have intrusive thoughts about my muscles atrophying when I'm sitting or resting. I still have intrusive thoughts about weight gain after eating, but generally they are more centered around ""health"" (cardiovascular function, muscle function, et cetera).

In terms of coping, I wish I had a perfect answer for you. I would say a big thing to remind yourself when you feel the intrusive voice starting to get loud, is that eating disorders drastically exaggerate the effect of any nutritional behaviors. You will not become completely unhealthy or physically compromised by any one meal, missed exercise, or ""treat"" food.
I know the anxiousness of not moving around can be especially rough when we have dealt with compulsive exercise for a long time.

163,12/03/2020,TrustingMyBody.,silverstars,"Hello,All.So i have been in recovery for about 5 months now and i am finally at the bottom end of a healthy weight.Just like my period returning,i should be celebrating this,as it just proves what hard work i have been doing,but all it makes me feel is panic.
Yesterday i was telling my dietician that i am so afraid that eating the way i have been eating will cause my weight to spike far past my goal weight.That i cannot trust my body,even when i try to reassure myself about my body likely eventually settling at a weight it feels right at.My dietician asked me how i would feel to reach a weight that would be higher than our original goal weight we set at the beginning of my recovery process.i told her how much the number scared me.She wants to know my weight so i do have to keep weighing myself for now,and the number going up makes me feel so frantic inside.i know i am much more than a number,but try telling that to the eating disorder.i have been doing a lot better,eating on a schedule,challenging myself to new foods,using positive self talk,but i do miss meals and snacks and sometimes i hear and listen to the ED voice telling me to skip a meal or snack.Other times i just utterly lose my appetite to anxiety or fatigue (I have terrible insomnia) and it is so hard to force myself to eat.Anyway,my dietician sent me a summary of our appointment and she wants me to think about what would help me to come to trust my body but i am at a loss because i don't trust it at all.i was completely controlling it for so long that i now sort of feel like it is rebelling against me,especially when i get ravenous or end up bingeing.So,just wondering if any of you have any insight into this,as to what exactly would help me to come to trust my body.Maybe i am not well enough connected to it or something.After all i was not caring for it,nurturing it for a long time.Most of the time i have no love for my body,and this weight gain certainly scares me.i am so confused.i just don't kn ow how to answer my dietician's question,so if any of you can  relate or help me with this i would greatly appreciate it.",recoveryj,"Thu,12/03/2020-9:17am","I think a lot of us can relate to this, myself included. Know that no matter what, you are so not alone.
I do just want to congratulate you on how hard you’ve been working and how much progress you’ve made! It takes an incredible amount of courage to get up every day and face those fears. Keep fighting ED. You are worth so much more
As far as body trust goes, I definitely still struggle with that. It’s so hard to let go of something we’ve been controlling for so long. One of the oddest things I’ve found is that the more I loosen my grip on control, the more things seem to work out. It feels counter-intuitive, but our bodies are a lot stronger and smarter than we give them credit for. They are just trying to protect us and reach a point where we’re functioning as well as we can be. Every time I try to exert my own control over than, things just get worse and my body becomes more unpredictable again.
Know that you are not a number. Think of it like height; if you woke up one day 2 inches taller, would that cause you to hate your body? Would that make you think any less of yourself?
We are often our own harshest critics. People don’t see you through the same judgmental lens you view yourself. If you do pass that weight, it is more than likely no one but you will notice. And if it is in the pursuit of attaining the ability to focus on your passions, feel GOOD in your body, and live your life, I’d say it’s more than worth it.",silverstars,"Sat,12/05/2020-3:11am","Thank you so much for your wise words and your encouragement,i so appreciate it.",kaygonzo,"Sat,12/05/2020-3:03pm","Hey!

164,11/30/2020,ANRecoveryTurningintoPurgingandotherUpdate,yoyokay,"I have been getting my weight back to normal after being dangerously low due to my anorexia. Now, I am at a normal weight but still really mentally messed up. One issue I am noticing is that because I still feel inclined to restrict to lose weight, my brain is feeling like I need to ""stock up"" and really eat now before I restrict again. Like my mind is arguing between eating a bunch and starving, ""You better enjoy eating now, then you'll go back to undereating again to get skinner"" Anyway, because of this I have over eaten on unhealthy foods lately (not sure if enough to be a ""binge"" but, definitely consistently overeating) and because I am already at a normal weight, I feel really badly about it afterwards and think about how my body will change from eating so poorly and not restricting like I used to. Because of this, I have been making myself throw up. I was alone on Thanksgiving because I couldn't see my family. I binged and purged a couple of times that day. Bingeing was never an issue for me throughout my anorexia but now it is like because I am trying to give myself permission to eat normally, my brain is overly excited and wanting to eat everything that sounds tasty because it's afraid I am going to be really strict and eat tiny amounts of food again. I feel like I am emotionally eating a lot as well, eating for comfort because other things are so bad right now. I have had a rocky relationship that negatively impacted my mental health but we are doing okay right now. My bf recently moved into an apartment with someone he did not know beforehand. He seemed like an okay guy and we were all hanging out this weekend. Well, my bf went to the store and his roommate and I stayed behind because he was sketching a tattoo design for my leg. While my bf was gone, he sexually assaulted me. I don't know what to do or if I should tell my boyfriend. My bf used to call me bad names and be paranoid and jealous last year and earlier this year, so I am not sure if telling him would be good or not. I got blood drawn for an STD check and plan B today because I am really nervous he could have given me a disease. I have been distracted all day and sick feeling. I couldn't sleep and stop thinking about what he did. I am so overwhelmed and it feels like my life is just one terrible event or situation after another.

I am not sure if anything beneficial would come of reporting because I have no proof and it could be dangerous if he had people try to hurt me or my bf. I don't know. I know that I would encourage anyone else to come forward and seek justice but, in my case I feel like it would be more disruptive than good.

Or who knows if he could hurt your boyfriend.I hope your labs are fine and that you did not get any disease. Please try to talk to someone about this. Eating disorders can get exacerbated by abuse. We know we are not at the best place so better to try to act in a proactive way. If you do not want to report the guy, at least talk to a trained professional about the situation. Also, please be kind to yourself. Your body wants to eat because it knows you are an specialist in restricting (I am the same!). But eventually, it will stop acting as is.

I just want to be done thinking about this. I am so exhausted and I want to give up trying. I am out of hope that things will get better for me. Every time that I think the worst has happened to me, something manages to be even more terrible. I am not sure if I will go to the police.

I was assaulted earlier this year by a neighbor at a party while I was drunk. I couldn’t remember anything the next day, but there were no drugs in my system and he had no priors so the police weren’t able to do anything. If you don’t do it for yourself, report him for the next girl he assaults. He will do it again if he doesn’t learn. He is on parole so the police are much much more likely to believe you over him. You deserve that justice.Please take care of yourself and reach out to loved ones or the resources in your area. My county gave me an advocate to talk to on the phone to help me through my assault.

165,12/01/2020,Doinggreat...whilehoarding...X?,kaygonzo,"Hey all!
Wondering if anyone has struggled with hoarding random food while in recovery, and perhaps can share how they manage this mental pattern.
I’ve had an eating disorder in the background of my life for a long time, but manage symptoms and have ‘healthy’ diet and exercise habits as a general rule. One thing that I have not really been able to face is my food hoarding,
 This isn’t pandemic stockpiling. This is what I do. I buy boxes upon boxes of X (I don’t even really eat them) and X, In my apartment, I have  maybe 10 Costco sized boxes of X, 10 boxes of X, 10 boxes of X. The x I eat, but everything else is a rare indulgence.
What the heck.
Why am I doing this? Does anyone else do this? I feel like a crazy person surrounded by X for no reason.",yoyokay,"Tue,12/01/2020-5:33pm","Yes, I found myself buying way too much food at the grocery store every time I would go. Mostly nonperishable things like frozen foods, canned things, or boxed dry goods. These are things I wasn't even allowing myself at all because I felt they were too unhealthy. My brain, however, really wanted them so it was like trying to at least comfort my cravings by having those foods accessible or trying to convince myself to finally let myself eat some of the foods that I had restricted. Like, ""You've already spent money on this stuff, might as well eat it"". I had a lot of foods lingering in my freezer and cabinet because I kept buying but not eating stuff.",recoveryj,"Tue,12/01/2020-6:54pm","This is definitely a “normal” part of recovery. The brain is still operating from a scarcity mindset due to restriction. When we go out and buy food, the survival instinct takes over and we get way more than we need. The brain doesn’t know the difference between a food shortage and ED restriction; it just knows it’s starving. So when it sees the opportunity for food, it just wants to make sure you’ll always have enough. It’s actually your brain’s way of protecting you and trying to save you!!
That said, I can understand why it feels so out of control. One of the ways I’ve found that helps is to keep feeding yourself regularly; your body will slowly regain trust that it will be fed. Even more; try to work in those foods you’ve been avoiding. Then the brain will understand that it will get what it wants, not only enough, but certain cravings too. I know that’s a terrifying process, but it really, really helps. Cravings are usually the body’s way of telling us we need a certain nutrient; it’s completely okay to listen to that! It can be so hard to trust our bodies, but I promise it does get easier. Try challenging the ED mindset and allow yourself those foods. Eat at regular intervals, and you’ll see that the hoarding will start to ease as both your brain and your body trust you again",kaygonzo,"Wed,12/02/2020-10:46am",Thanks everyone. Good to hear I am not alone in this and I think working these foods into my diet is a good idea. I realized that the foods I have been hoarding are foods I used to binge on when my ED was really taking over my life. So I guess this is my recovery challenge! Will try eating a meal with a single serving of the hoarded ‘used to binge’ food that my body is craving. I can do this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
166,10/30/2020,MissbeingtheAnorexicGirl?,yoyokay,"I have been doing better physically, been getting myself to eat a higher and safer calorie amount and gain a little bit of weight. I feel like a fraud for doing better. I am no longer the dangerously thin girl and I have gotten myself to let go of or manage a lot of ED behaviors in my daily life. Idk, it is like I was almost proud of being ""good at having an eating disorder"", I let it become my identity. Reading over ED behavioral questionaires and seeing that I have successfully lessened a lot of my compulsions makes me feel kind of bad.",jess64,"Sat,10/31/2020-10:46am","Hi yoyokay,
I think what you are experiencing is pretty common in recovery. It is hard to switch your mindset, even when your behaviors improve and let your brain know that everything you are doing is good for you! EDs are such powerful voices, so don’t be ashamed that you are struggling to match your feelings to your actions. Just remember you are helping your body and your mind heal, even when it isn’t easy. You are so much more than your ED! I hope things get easier with time, sending hugs!",Annet,"Sat,10/31/2020-9:37pm","I am there with you. Although I am doing the right things, sometimes I feel bad due to it.
I am grieving my eating disorder. But eventually, I am sure we will let it go.
Keep going!Annet",yoyokay,"Sun,11/01/2020-2:06pm","I’m having such I hard time I feel like a failure when I can’t follow my own food rules, can’t ignore my hunger or I go over my calorie limit. I want to not care and just live my life but I already hate the weight that I have gained!",jennahugs,"Thu,11/12/2020-3:53pm","This can be so difficult - I used to (and still can now and then) see myself as a fraud, claiming that I have an eating disorder (it’s the mindset) yet I don’t indulge in the behaviours anywhere near to how I once did, and my weight is normal. I admit also I’ve sometimes been jealous of anybody I saw going down that path, as if an ED was supposed to be MY thing.
It takes so much willpower but I do everything I can to remember the consequences of being consumed by the ED, and remind myself that when it was that bad, even if numbers were lower I never saw myself as underweight, was never going to and still believed I was eating too much. But I get it, it becomes your identity for a reason so to be parted from it is tough - for me it was often so much easier to remember what I perceived to be the “advantages” of it rather than the damage, so I have to make that choice to remember and hate the damage.
Something that really helped me was being told that an ED sees to all the RIGHT needs (such as the need for a sense of purpose/achievement/safety) initially, but the WRONG way; a way that will ultimately steal your entire identity and life. Believing you’re a failure for not following it’s rules is exactly what it wants. I can’t ignore my hunger either so I’ve had to work on refusing to feel guilty for that! You’re not a failure, you’re a fighter",yoyokay,"Fri,11/13/2020-2:45pm","Now that I no longer look dangerously skinny its like there is nothing unique about me. I know that weight is not the most important thing about me or anyone, but this disorder really had consumed my entire life, so really it did take me away from other interests and activities and feel like my only traits were ""skinny"", ""sick"" or ""anorexic"".",Annet,"Fri,11/13/2020-8:41pm","I know what you mean. We have lived with an eating disorder for so many years that it is not easy to just let it go. We need to grieve it. We need to pass through a process where we accept our new life, let go our ED and find out new things to replace it.
All of this is not easy. Sometimes I find myself with ""a lot of time in my hands"" and I just hate not to have an ED to keep me busy.
I am not completely recovered but I do not have any behaviours. At the moment, I am fighting against my mind and my false beliefs.
So, I understand how this is. I also miss to be the lady who used to workout a lot and who was very thin. But now, I understand that was ""not a life"" or a ""nice way of living"". I am sure you understand it, too.Hugs

That is where I am! I am trying to discover the new person I am becoming, the new me!
About my body, I have been gaining pretty slowly. So, I have been able to adapt easily to my new weight. However, in the last 2 months, the process has started to be faster. I eat freely and with no issues. But my regrets happen when I realize my body is changing. I know I should be happy. But my mind needs to get adapted, too. I am working on it with my therapist. Also, covid is not helping a lot with practicing eating with people, going out to restaurants or getting new hobbies.Although I am discovering the new me, I am sure, I would also like to discover the new person I would be if life were normal... before covid...",yoyokay,"Thu,11/19/2020-11:23am","I completely agree about Covid. Before C-19, I did have many things to look forward to, but then it was complete isolation and the only things to fill my time were running and meal planning to try and make sure I ate as little as possible. Now, I am eating less restrictively, but spend a lot of time just home alone, which is really weighing on my mental health. I think if the world were in a better place, it would make it easier for us to individually be in a healthier place and be better off emotionally. I miss hanging out with my friends, going on little day trips just for fun, and going to ""non essential"" places like art museums and music shows.",silverstars,"Sat,11/21/2020-9:33am","Hi,
i just wanted to let you know that i can relate to your inner struggle with this.i am gaining weight now and i have had nothing really to replace my eating disorder with.i am having a lot of trouble with my OCD and anxiety and the ED helped with that,as destructive as i know it was.i just don't feel...""special"" anymore,which i know is such twisted thinking.
i hope we all can get to a place where we can derive meaning from a recovered life.",yoyokay,"Tue,12/01/2020-12:38pm","Thank you for your reply. I think it is one of those little things that are a part of our eating disorder that people who have never experienced it don't understand. How could you ""miss"" your ED? Well, it is hard not to miss something that seemed to take over our entire lives, even if it is harmful. Maybe it is kind of like an abusive partner or just like any addiction. I know my bf who used to be an addict has said that he doesn't know what to do all of the time because he used to just get high as well as drink anytime he was awake. Hopefully things will normalize and we can find beneficial parts of life to immerse ourselves in.",kaygonzo,"Tue,12/01/2020-11:16am","Hey there y’all.
Wow this is familiar. I remember when I was in treatment and started gaining weight. I felt like I was “bad at having an eating disorder”... which then made me feel very alone and crazy. I knew I had to give it up, but losing my ED was losing the thing that had become the biggest thing about me as a person.
I have not been hospitalized since 2004, and while the struggle still continues it is in the background of so many other things that I am, and is a small part of me.
We will likely always have symptoms of an ED, but as that identity fades we can build an identity that is vibrant and joyful and changes the world for the better.
If I can get through it, you can! Today is a new day and you can be something amazing.",yoyokay,"Tue,12/01/2020-12:43pm","It is really encouraging to hear from you. I am sure you have had a whole lot of pain from ED but, it sounds like you are getting along okay. I want to get through the day okay too. I got a tattoo to remind myself that ""I am not my body"". My identity is not my weight and the most valuable trait of mine was not that I was ""skinny"". Thank you for writing in response to my post.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am eating well and taking care of my body. But somehow, I get frustrated to see that my body does not seem to heal/repair itself fast.Is this something normal in recovery or after having had an eating disorder for many years?
My doctors have told me that it took me 21 years to get to the place where I am. Hence, I can not expect my body to heal overnight. This makes sense BUT I feel so frustrated. I expected to be back to ""normal"" once my normal eating was reinstated.

However, you will likely heal someday. For me, it’s more of a mental and emotional healing and for others, it’s physical. I struggled with over exercising too. Honestly, if your body never gets to the same super fit point again, I would call that a victory. You will need to learn to love and accept your body and all of the strength it already has. Surviving an ED takes enormous strength, as it is the most deadly mental illness there is. You are strong and worthy of healing. Something I have been enjoying is yoga and stretching. It does great things for your body and strengthens the mind-body connection the more you do it. Of course, always consult your doctor first. Best of luck",Annet,"Tue,11/17/2020-10:14pm","I am sorry to hear about your balance issues. In my case, I used to be a competitive runner and a fitness instructor in my 20's. I am now 40 and unable to run or even to walk long distances.
I think so much training and eating disorders are not compatible. My body got too much damaged and now, I am having to accept to live with the consequences.
I have several health issues but the one that bothers me the most is to not being able to workout normally. I also would love to run but my knees and my lower back just do not want to.
Sometimes I wonder WHY I can not accept this as my other health issues. Both were caused by my ED but I am not sure if it is that I still need to grieve my running and retirement from athletic competitions or if it is my eating disorder the one wanting me to run.
I really do not know...I suffer a lot. I do miss running. It used to be my life. On the other hand, I know running is not a healthy thing for my joints.
Sometimes I wonder if I will ever be healthy, again... I wish I will. But only God knows...Hugs

It is true for me. Since I am unable to train at a certain level, I know I will never be able to have the body I want. However, I am working on accepting my body and loving all that it allows me to do.
I like yoga but I so hyperactive that I need a bit more of physical activity. However, my body would be happy just with yoga, some stretching or pilates.

Before that I need to get ready and go to a friends house with all the ingredients to make stuffing, and then make it.I’m a professional athlete (pretty much), yesterday was the first day I didn’t exercise in almost a month. It’s been a long time since I’ve skipped more than one day. I’m not supposed to go back to work until Monday. I know rest is good for me, but it feels so viscerally uncomfortable, like I’m going stir crazy. Last night I showered but I wasn’t sweaty like usual and it really bothers me. I want to break, scream, cry, get it out of me. I don’t know.I thought I had all this more or less under control, I’ve been recovered from anorexia and the binge/bulimia stuff comes and goes. But yesterday I agonized over ice cream for like 20 minutes, I also talked myself out of breakfast and lunch this morning. When I woke up I ate anyway, which feels like both success and failure, but now I’m full and I’m scared I’ll keep eating, scared I won’t be hungry for thanksgiving dinner. I’m scared I don’t have the focus or control to stop anymore, that I’ve lost that anorexic determination.I love my body the way it is, but I don’t want to be unhealthy or gain too much weight — but mostly I’m worried and scared and sick and tired of these behaviors and not being able to enjoy thanksgiving like a normal person.

I was able to find a therapist I see remotely that has been really helpful to me especially during COVID. I think stopping and remembering things that worked for you in the past could be helpful, too. Even if it's not a therapist, maybe the friend you mentioned, maybe it would feel good to have someone to talk to about this stuff.

173,11/24/2020,"Youhavetochoose:it'sme,ortheeatingdisorder",bundtie,"Some disordered thoughts are so normal to me and were so normalized around me growing up, that I don't even realize they're part of my mental illness. I first started with disordered eating at age 13 and I am 25 now.I have been pushing myself to be more active in seeking fully recovery over the last 2 years, and my partner is a big source of support but also anxiety and stress from pushing me towards full recovery. In August, we moved to a new city and my partner encouraged me to get rid of my scale in the move. I have weighed myself every day for the last 7 years, with breaks here and there when it wasn't possible. I also decided that I was going to try to eat a little more, because I was feeling weak and fatigued.It has been a lot of change for me. Living in a new city with no family or friends around. Switching to a new job in a different industry. Different schedules for me and my partner. COVID OBVIOUSLY. Quitting the routine of weighing myself and maintaining at the weight I decided was the right weight. Trying to listen to my body and refocus on health and strength.It's good, but it's stressful. I had a small freak-out over realizing that I have gained weight since getting rid of my scale, and I blamed my partner for it. Somehow I didn't realize that being extremely stressed about gaining a small amount of weight and turning my stress on someone else, is a form of disordered thinking? I lost all perspective for a bit. My partner helped me get it back but I also hurt her feelings in the process, which I feel bad about.Yesterday she told me, you have to choose, it's me or the eating disorder. I had to think for a long bit because of the cravings that I've been feeling towards disordered behavior. I've been having thoughts like, ""if I were single, I could do xyz."" I feel like there are two paths forward for me. In one, I'm alone and I'm doing whatever ED stuff I want; it's thrilling but it's also empty and exhausting and I have a lot of regrets. In the other, I'm with her and there is actually meaning in my life, even though it's hard at times.I told her, I choose you. It's hard. I'm trying to push myself and find support.",recoveryj,"Fri,11/27/2020-10:06pm","You have so much incredible strength. I can definitely relate to the temptation of isolating and just going back to behaviors. Being able to make those huge changes and direct yourself toward recovery is so amazing. I’m so glad you have such an understanding and supportive partner. Sometimes we need a little tough love too. Breaking up with the scale was such a big step for me, and it sounds like it was for you as well. You have so much courage for all you have done especially with all that’s going on right now. I’m so glad to hear you’re choosing your partner; you’re choosing life. We are so much more than our EDs, even when it can be difficult to see sometimes. I hope you’re able to continue moving forward. Know that you’re always welcome here as well. Thank you for your inspiring post <3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

176,11/08/2020,It'sBack.,silverstars,"Hello Everyone,So i have been in recovery for a few months and it has been a difficult road.
i have made a lot of progress according to my dietician,but i need her perspective because all i see is consistent failure.
i have been having a lot of trouble with my meals when my appetite is absolutely stolen by paralyzing anxiety,but i have been doing my best.So.
i have gained some weight,my body is changing,becoming softer,and i must admit i miss all my old sharp angles.i felt much safer,smaller,sharper.
i have often been saying to my pyschiatrist that i so want to go back to my old life.He keeps reminding me of how unhappy i was then.i have not found contentment in recovery yet,but maybe that is because it is so early yet,and i am still struggling.Anyway.
i had lost my period to anorexia for over two years and the other day it showed up.i did not know how to feel.i know how i should feel.
Pride,relief.
Happiness that my body is restoring itself back to a healthy place.But,to be honest,i only felt disgust.i felt frantic.i don't know how to turn my mind around so that i can see this as only a positive thing...",Annet,"Sun,11/08/2020-10:27pm","Congratulations on getting your period back! That means you are doing a great job with regards to recovery. I understand you may feel bad with regards to weight gain and because you still do not see the ""real benefits"" of a happy recovered life.
I still remember myself asking my phychiastrist for a signal: a signal that told me that all the pain and effort I was going through was really worth it.
Recovering from an eating disorder is not just a physical thing. It is common that our bodies recover first than our minds. So, give recovery some time.
You will eventually feel happy and positive about recovery.",silverstars,"Mon,11/09/2020-5:36am","Thank you so much for your support,Annet.",yoyokay,"Mon,11/09/2020-1:13pm","I feel exactly the same way regarding my body and where you are in recovery.

Even though I am still technically underweight, I hate where my body is and want to go back ""just a few pounds at least"". But I know this thinking could lead me down a very dangerous path if I start restricting more again and if I start basing my food needs based on the amount I exercise.

177,11/17/2020,FeelingLostinRecovery,goblinsnail,"This is my first post ever on a forum like this so forgive me if I don't quite know how to phrase things. My ED was pretty bad a few years back in middle school. It stayed that way for two years before I entered a better headspace and began to recover somewhat. I think my bigger issue was the fact that I never admitted to having an ED and am only now recognizing that I ever did have one. Because of this, I never looked for a proper recovery process and instead I have bouts of being healthy and then relapses that I don't really realize are relapses. I recover and have a good relationship with food and then the next few months, I'm back to feeling disgusted and embarrassed when I eat. I think a big chunk of why I still struggle is because how messed up my poor metabolism is. I complain about a slow metabolism when I'm the one to blame in the first place. I'm constantly undereating even when I'm relatively healthy. I feel so lost.But when I eat a normal amount of food, what I'm supposed to eat, I gain weight. It makes me feel even worse because I'm already clinically overweight. I just don't know how to balance it. I've been doing fine, but I was recently quarantined as a precautionary measure because of exposure to COVID. It just messed me up, both that and school. I was pretty proud of my recovery for a while, I felt healthy, but I'm relapsing again. I get intrusive thoughts and it takes so much willpower to shake them away but I still fail sometimes.",Julianna.milazzo,"Tue,11/17/2020-5:04pm","I can hear your frustration. I was dealing with the same issues. I was seeing a therapist and she suggested for months that I’d get treatment for the eating disorder but I didn’t believe I had one since I was a normal weight and everyone applauded me for over exercising and restricting my food. So I though everything was normal. Until I finally had up with the vicious cycle (just like you’re dealing with) and went to a treatment center. And thank the lord I did because they saved my life. It was the best decision I’ve ever made. I think that it would help you too. I know it’s hard to believe you have ED but that’s not you thinking that, it your eating disorder, it doesn’t want you to get help so it’s doing everything in its power to change your mind. I can tell how strong you are, don’t give up and don’t give in. You are stronger than your eating disorder. Hugs and loves",yoyokay,"Thu,11/19/2020-11:11am","The cycle that you are stuck in seems like a miserable place to be, I am sorry that the negative thoughts have been getting to you. Staying on top of body acceptance and practicing healthy behaviors can be a daily task for us, and I hope it gets easier. I do not think that weight should be our greatest concern, but if you are concerned about issues you may be having with your metabolism, it may be helpful to reach out to your general practitioner. I would mention your history of ED, so that your doctor does not give you misguided information. In terms of your emotional well being, surrounding yourself with positive people who make you feel valued for what you are beyond your body can help you feel happy and get you to be less often hung up on you body. I know ED is exhausting and painful to deal with. You deserve to live life without weight being your biggest concern. Living in fear and stress about calories and weight has really taken away my ability to have enjoyable moments, and I am sure it has affected many chunks of your life as well. I am also in a semi-recovered state, but was so stubborn for so long that I never let myself get the level of treatment that I really needed. So now my body is at a normal weight, but I have not managed the mental aspects of my ED, because I insisted on doing recovery on my own. I really wish that I had let go of my ED and accepted the treatment that I needed. I think seeing a therapist could help you work through what you are feeling. I hope things get better.

181,11/07/2020,AmIbeingoversensitive?,taupelle,"So today I decided to step out of my comfort zone and wear something I typically wouldn’t wear. It was a skirt and a bralette. I felt crazy insecure in it but knew I should come out of my comfort zone and try to wear it anyways. It’s an outfit I think is really cute but my eating disorder is just extremely loud when I wear it. Well in my moments of insecurity I decided to go to my mom and ask her if looked okay. I was hoping she’d just be nice and tell me I look great but instead the minute I walked into the room she made a face at me. So I asked what was wrong and then asked if I looked okay. Her response was “I guess”. So I asked what she means and then she proceeded to tell me I looked like a square in my skirt.Honestly I should have expected this because my mom is extremely insensitive to people’s feelings and never cares if she hurts someone. But I got upset and told her that was rude to say and then she got mad at me. I decided to just walk away from the situation because I knew it would lead to an argument. Needless to say I changed my outfit immediately and I have no intentions on ever wearing a skirt again. Right now I’m just wearing sweatpants and a shirt and I don’t even wanna go anywhere anymore. I sought out advice from my aunt, another big mistake because she’s also incredibly insensitive and always takes my moms side. She went on to tell me I was being immature and overly sensitive. Am I being over sensitive?? I feel like it’s not crazy for me to be offended over this and it’s not like I even reacted harshly or mean towards her. I literally just walked away to stop an argument.

182,11/05/2020,LackofConcentration+HavingNoControl,grace7879,"Hi :)
This is my 6th week in my Anorexia recovery. The first week was obviously hard, but it gradually got better until around the 4th-week mark. I lost weight in one of my clinic's check-ups, but this was purely due to the fact my body was ready for an increase in energy consumption. But thanks to this, it almost gave my brain the opportunity to convince me that I NEEDED to then lose more weight. Due to this, it led to me compensating for weight gain by X and lying to family about what I was eating.
Now I'm in a really bad position and being told that hospitalization is on the table if I don't get my act up. I do, all I really want to do is just get better, I want to be normal again and get Anorexia out of my life for good. But I now feel like I have a ""permanent reflex"" when it comes to X. I just don't feel I have any control over it at all. Whenever there's a split second I'm alone with food, literally 10 seconds, I have gotten up and X without even thinking about it. And if I don't get to X I feel incredibly guilty.Another thing is I cannot concentrate to save my life. I know when your malnourished you do struggle to concentrate but it's not like I'm not eating anything. I still have my 3 meals and 1-2 snacks a day so I'm defiantly fueled but I just cannot get myself to focus on anything other than food and mealtimes. It leads me to get even more stress out as I'm lacking on my school work, which then adds ANOTHER layer of stress as I'm currently not in school due to my ED.

183,10/31/2020,Relapsing?Newfearoftextures?,taupelle,"Hey everyone! I’ve been in recovery for only about three months. I spent two months in residential, and the last month in php in a different state, now I’m currently doing php 7 days a week at home through telehealth. I’ve realized that I haven’t worked on a lot in regards to my eating disorder. The residential program I was in was a terrible fit for me and barely did any actual work, I made progress in separating myself from my eating disorder and working on my social anxiety but that was about it. I switched to a php program about 6 hours away, a few states away. It’s an amazing program and I’ve made a lot of progress since I’ve been there. But now I’m doing the program from home and I’m noticing myself slipping back into old habits. I’m able to look in the mirror and feel confident at times and even like the way I look in pictures, but there’s still a lot of comparing and body checking going on. I’m also noticing eating disorder behaviors popping up. Such as being extremely picky about food, lying about being hungry and saying I feel nauseous so I don’t have to eat as much, I had a panic attack over a drink from Starbucks the other day as well. Tonight really freaked me out though. My mom cooked me dinner and for some reason the texture was making me physically ill. This is a problem I had 4 years ago when I was at my sickest point, I actually ended up cutting meat out completely because of it. It’s really starting to freak me out because I had no control over the feeling. I felt physically ill, like I was going to be sick to my stomach. I have no idea how to control this and deal with it.I’ll more than likely see my dietician on Monday and I plan on bringing it up to her. I’ll also bring it up to my therapist next week as well. But in the meantime does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this?? I have no idea what to do if I physically can’t eat a food even if it’s just my eating disorder. I don’t want to cut meat out completely again but I don’t know how to fight this. I just feel really out of control right now.",recoveryj,"Sun,11/01/2020-7:48am","First of all, please know that you’re not alone. I have had my fair share of panics over fear foods, even in recovery! It shows just how strong you are and how far you’ve come that you’re able to recognize this and that you plan on bringing it up with your dietician! EDs thrive on secrecy, so being open about it is a huge step in the right direction. Sometimes, our bodies can manifest our anxieties physically. That happens to me a lot. I often feel nauseated if I’m anxious, and it took me a while to realize that feeling was coming from my anxiety and not an external source. Have you been feeling extra worried or stressed about things lately? Maybe it would be helpful if this happens again to take a moment to breathe, maybe excuse yourself for a minute and just close your eyes and really connect with your feelings. I find journaling helps me out a lot. Maybe journal about what comes up. Your feelings are valid. And you deserve to feel and express them. Just know they won’t last forever. And maybe you’ll find you feel better after just focusing on breathing for a little while, and then the meal becomes easier.
I hope you find something that help, take care!",pjordner,"Wed,11/04/2020-9:12pm","I want you to know that I’m truly at this same spot with you. It’s been getting worse again because I’ve realized what little dent I made in my recovery the first time around. I’m so glad you’re going to your dietician about it and actually taking the courageous steps to seek help, which is nearly as difficult as the actual healing part. I’ve been becoming more picky with food (similar to my symptoms before recovery) and will actually eat a meal before becoming so disgusted that I can’t return to that food for weeks/months. Same thing is happening to me with meat. What makes it so hard is that the food our EDs “let” us have is already limited, so when I’m getting grossed out it feels SO frustrating because I’m running out of ideas for what to eat. I don’t want to only eat one thing and get sick of that too! When it comes to your mom’s food that she made, I truly think you don’t have to worry it will last forever. One day you’ll be like, “hmm, that actually sounds super good to me right now!” But no doubt it’s hard right now, easy to feel at a loss. Keep going. Keep advocating for yourself. Just knowing that you reached out for help and are posting about it on here, I know I believe in you. We will both get through this. Baby steps.",taupelle,"Sat,11/07/2020-3:27pm",Thank you guys for the responses. It’s a huge relief to know I’m not the only one going through this.

I've proud to say that I haven't experienced a binge episode in weeks (if not over a month). However, I've noticed I've been eating more than I need to on a daily basis.

191,10/27/2020,Strugglingevennow,jennahugs,"I’m about to turn 28, was diagnosed with anorexia at 14 (although it started at 12). It’s been such a journey over the years to say the least...
I couldn’t say I’m “fully recovered” but I’ve been in a decent place for a while, maintaining a safe weight and on the whole able to live a full and enjoyable life. Although certain food/body-related worries are usually in the background, they don’t dominate anywhere near to the level they have done in the past.
But even now I still have those days (today) where I just feel so fat, ugly and I can’t identify any of the deeper roots/anxieties. The self-disgust becomes my reality, no matter how much therapy I’ve had recently or over the years.
It doesn’t impact my behaviour, but the low mood is pretty dark and lonely. Talking about it with family/friends usually results in an argument; they’ve heard it all before and have run out of things to tell me. Therefore I tend to keep it to myself these days.

Another thing, I have a weight that is healthy and I feel comfortable at, and i'm always trying hard to keep myself there. But I have went a little over my number. I tried laxatives and now I'm going to diet. I feel so sad and fat,",recoveryj,"Sun,10/25/2020-12:05pm","Please try to understand that if you’re having to fight your body to maintain a weight, that weight isn’t healthy for you. I know it’s hard to watch the numbers go up, but know that it’s a natural process of your body trying to protect you and get you to a weight that actually is healthy. When you say “fat”, what do you mean? Because it is healthy to have some fat, and fat is not a feeling. Are you feeling uncomfortable? Anxious? Sad? Why are these emotions coming up? Maybe that would be a good thing to explore in therapy.
Know that we will never weigh the same thing every day. That is impossible. And bodies are changing and growing all the time; your body is fighting for you. It wants to get you to a place where you don’t have to fight it anymore. And I hope you can find that too. In the meantime, know that you are not alone. Losing weight and dieting is never the answer.

I know it’s probably not what you want to hear, but the harder you cling to a specific number weight-wise, the more anxious you will feel when it comes to events such as family visiting when food is likely to be different to what you’re comfortable with, especially when you’re experiencing this illness alone which it sounds like you are. I appreciate though if you really can’t tell your family about it.
Whenever I’ve dreaded upcoming social gatherings because of the food anxiety, it’s eased it a little to focus on enjoying the company of the people, and realising I can connect with them much more easily when I’m not analysing my intake or avoiding eating altogether.
Really, a couple of days of “different” eating is not going to cause an extreme transformation, people do this all the time. And remember that it’s so so typical of an ED to convince you that any normal upward weight fluctuation is something huge, horrific and unacceptable.
THAT IS A LIE
Whilst it will feel like the right thing to do, dieting/laxatives will only reinforce the destructive way of thinking plus be so physically damaging. You possibly know a lot of this already, but unfortunately there’s no logic in the ED mindset.Look after yourself, sending love",yoyokay,"Fri,10/30/2020-11:06am",How are you doing now?

I've been ""in the clear"" of my ed (or so i thought) for the last two years. i'm in my mid 20s and had one for almost 10 years. i never sought professional help, mainly because i never told anyone close to me. but now that i am in a long term relationship and living w my partner, he knows about it and i tell him if i have slip ups. i recently started therapy and my therapist suggested i join a message board for support. one thing i'm struggling with is identifying triggers. since i never sought professional help and thought i recovered on my own, it's difficult to identify them. anyone have tips? i'd appreciate them :)",weouthere,"Fri,10/30/2020-10:07am","Congrats on starting therapy!! That’s amazing that you were able to realize you needed help and get yourself that help. I know that can be a really tiring process but it’s definitely worth it. I’m also in my 20s and have had my ed since I was a kid and thought I could figure it all out myself. I didn’t get help until college when I started relapsing.Identifying triggers is hard for people like us because they’re so deep and engrained into how we grew up that it’s hard to tell where they’re coming from. I figured out my triggers by observing how I felt when I was upset and thinking about how I got there. For example, when one of my roommates mentions they forgot to eat lunch or talks about a new diet they’re going on, I noticed I get really defensive and angry at them. So that’s one of mine.Definitely bring that up with your new therapist as something you’d like to work on. The more you are honest with them and talk about your goals, the more they can help you.

I bet that’s even more enhanced right now during COVID. You say you know you’ll fast before hand, but is that true? It hasn’t happened yet, and you have both the strength and the power to instead nourish your body throughout the day. You can take control and say “no” to ED. You deserve to be nourished and even enjoy the food! That may not yet be where you’re at, but you are worthy of every step of the journey it takes to get there. You have the power of choice. Maybe try out that power and choose to feed yourself instead of listening to ED. See what comes up. What emotions and feelings and fears you may experience. Allow them to sit with you, realizing that no feeling lasts forever. Thank them for alerting you but tell them there is no danger, that you are okay now and you don’t need ED to protect you anymore. That you know your worth and you can allow that to manifest and be present in the moment. Notice how you’re able to connect with others better without the thoughts of analyzing the food constantly nagging. I know it’s easier said than done, but it takes practice.

197,10/24/2020,AlittleintroductionandupdateonmeIsuppose,Justme,"Hi! You can call me derv. I'm thirteen and I was diagnosed with anorexia when I was 12 I have been in recovery for almost two years, although I've had an ed much longer. My sister also has an ed, she is 15 and was diagnosed when she was 13. She had to go to hospital because of how deep she was in it. My parents were able to catch mine earlier than hers though, as they knew the signs, but I was in denial for so very long. Even when is was diagnosed I didn't believe it. I remember when my dad told me I would be staying home from school for a week because of it. I remember thinking ""wow I didn't think it was that serious"" well aha I ended up staying off for about 6 months while in recovery. It's wierd and hard and it's so hard especially when my ed and rational brain seem so intertwined that I don't know what to believe. Anyways I am quite far along my journey, or at least I am a lot better than I was then, like a lot. And I guess I kinda thought I was recovered a bit, I mean I knew I wasn't but I thought, if I live the rest of my life how I am with my disorder right now it's okay because it is manageable. But it's not okay. I stumbled upon a Pinterest board of inspirational things to keep me going I made when I had first started to recover and it hit pretty hard, it made me remember my hatred for the disorder, what it had done to me and how much it has ruined parts if my life. Although, I'm scared. once I read all that I thought ""I need to keep challenging it, I need to keep recovering, infact I will go downstairs and make myself a small glass of warm milk before bed"" but I can already feel that determination and rationality fading, I am so afraid tomorrow I will wake up in the same mindset I had before like ""i already feel terrible I don't need to do things like challenging my ed that will make my mood worse."" I'm scared for myself, sometimes it feels like I am trapped inside the ed, the anxiety and depression. So yeah Its nice to meet you, I know that's a lot of info sorry.",jennahugs,"Mon,10/26/2020-10:22am","Hello derv. You’ve written a really open and inspiring post there, which I’m sure will be valuable for loads of people. “I can already feel that determination and rationality fading” - many many people go through this so you’re not alone; it can be so scary.
But the positive side is that you’re identifying your anxieties, and it shows that you do have that determination in you, even if you can’t always feel it. Recovery can be such an up and down process, so if you do feel trapped in the ED, anxiety and depression, try to remember that it hasn’t always been that all-consuming and it won’t always be. But you’re right, you do need to keep challenging it even if it feels wrong to do so. I could have misunderstood, but when you say you’re scared for yourself, it sounds like you’re scared of experiencing certain feelings/thoughts.
Feelings/thoughts can and do change, especially if challenged. But I understand that when they’re so strong it can be hard to imagine they will, which is why it’s important to express and challenge them. That sounds like a great board you found, so hold onto whatever it is you need to keep you motivated! Keep going and keep expressing yourself. You have too much to lose to such a destructive illness",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Curious to know your thoughts and experiences!",weouthere,"Fri,10/23/2020-9:13am","In my experience, new relationships and early recovery don’t mix well. I actually went into recovery while dating someone who didn’t quite understand how to handle it and it ended up causing a lot of fights between us when I would relapse. My opinion is that recovery comes first, no matter what. Until you feel comfortable in your skin and can truly love yourself, you won’t be able to give a new relationship the attention it needs. Then again, if you meet someone and it just feels right, go for it. Everyone’s experiences are different. My recovery damaged my relationships but being single has given me the change to work on loving myself first. For others, having that support from someone they’re intimate with can be really healing. It all depends on the person.

I have a new therapist that I actually like (for once) and I feel like we’ve made progress in just a few short weeks. I’ve been trying to eat intuitively and give myself affirmations every day and drink enough water and overall take better care of myself. I’m more confident when I do these things, and I feel like it’s making a real difference.But then I remember I’ve gained weight and my body looks different. I remember my roommates are skinny and brag about eating very little all day. And I remember the number the doctor told me even when I asked her not to and wonder if it’s gone up since then. And suddenly all the confidence and glow of recovery is gone and I’m back in my ED. I’m back to skipping lunch and writing it off as “just listening to my body” when it’s really my anxiety suppressing my appetite. I’m back to body checking constantly and wondering why I look different than I did a minute ago. I’m back to anxiously trying to figure out how I can sneak in a workout in between work and hanging out with my roommates tomorrow. We’re supposed to do a fire in the backyard and have dinner and drinks but I’m sitting here worrying about the calories in a beverage that I haven’t even drank yet.How do I get out of this awful cycle?? I want to have fun tomorrow but I feel like restricting all day to make up for it. I just want to know that this will stop happening at some point.

However, at some point, they might have to make healthier choices. Maybe, this is not their moment, yet. But it is YOURS. This is your time to work on recovery. I would say ignore what they do for the sake of your wellness. Ask yourself objectively if what they are doing is really healthy.
Also, whenever you have to meet with friends, think of the things that you enjoy. For example, talking to them, sharing your experiences, joking, etc. Food will be there but do not make it the center of that gathering.Hugs",jess64,"Sat,10/17/2020-11:53am","Hi weoutthere, I am sorry to hear you are in a slump.

203,10/19/2020,I’mtryingbutit’ssooohardtodo,cls1994,"Hi! This is my first time posting. I’m speaking for myself and I hope you all understand. I’m trying but it’s difficult. I don’t tell the truth about when things get bad. I stretch the truth about what I feel. I sneak into my moms room to weigh myself at night and during the day. I emotional eat. I purge and restrict myself because I want to feel control and I feel like I have to be PERFECT! Others have told me for years they think I have really close to the perfect body. I have been told how perfect I am. I feel like I always have to even if I don’t agree with it. I abuse laxatives and diet pills. I isolate myself in my room when I need a break from the world because I’m an introvert. I also do that while I’m eating. I don’t like people watching me eat. Because sometimes people say things and do that trigger me. I have a hard time setting boundaries with people. I tend to let everyone walk all over me. I love the feeling of hunger in my stomach and it goes away after awhile. I’ve never been the one to count calories but sometimes I take it off my things so I don’t start that. It takes me an hour or more to shop because I like the control it gives me over my eating disorder and when things go bad they say things to trick me. They give me compliments and encouragement when they speak to me then they turn on me when I say we got to stop. I feel like they will try to blackmail me into. By saying things to make continue the eating disorder. Which I give in too. I just accepted the fact last year in 2019 I have an eating disorder. I don’t know what I am. Doctors say I’m anorexic,some say bulimic and some say ednos. All I knows is I got an eating disorder. I’m trying I really am but just like the sun going down and the moon comes up, to show just how fast the night changes. I don’t have many friends because I push them away or they leave me. My own family has done that. In program, nobody really talked to me. Then they would gossip about me and it made me feel worse about myself. The second time was better because it was Covid and everything was online but I saw the one girl who made me feel bad about myself. Then she left program but I hope one day we become friends or at least be nice to one another. But I feel like that will never happen. Because that never happens to me. I’m easily triggered by my eating disorder. Sometimes I don’t even know it till I feel it coming on me. But I’m trying to get better. It’s just so hard to give up one of the biggest coping skills I have( I know it’s bad). I see the medical doctor Thursday and I’m terrified to see her. Recovery is such a roller coaster.",recoveryj,"Tue,10/20/2020-8:37am","I’m sorry to hear you’re struggling right now. There is definitely a lot going on that is stressful and triggering. I definitely understand wanting to be in control.
One of the things that I noticed is that making connections, friends only comes at the sacrifice of ED. Not to say there won’t be people to support you during the struggle, but in order for you to feel truly connected, ED has to go. It takes us out of the moment and instead focuses on the constant worries and thoughts about body/food. In order to become present and really form friendships that you can feel, that has to go.
I’m not saying it will be easy; I’ve been in this for almost 8 years. But it does get better. I’m also sorry about all the inappropriate comments people have made about your body. Your body does not exist for their pleasure or judgement!! It is YOURS!!! You should feel free to present yourself however you feel comfortable! There is NO SUCH THING as the “perfect” body. With the immense diversity we see in the world, that idea in itself is ridiculous. Do we judge flowers for looking different? Do we say “oh that is the perfect flower”? Or are we able to appreciate nature in its fullness and beauty through the diversity in the plants and the changing of the seasons?
That is where true beauty lives; in uniqueness. And you, just by existing and being you, are truly individual and unique. There will never be another you. No one could even try. So don’t listen to those voices telling you to “control” your body. Instead, try to tune in. What does your body say it needs? How can tou validate yourself and your being in this moment? Think of all the things that make you, you. Take care of your amazing body; it has gotten you through a lot. And nourish yourself so you can be in your body again, be in the present, and make those connections you truly desire and deserve",cls1994,"Tue,10/20/2020-3:47pm",Thank you for saying that!!

204,10/12/2020,FeelingStuck(OSFED),BeeTrying,"At around November 2019 I made the decision to try for recovery. My initial reasoning behind that decision was not the healthiest,but overall I was tired of the disordered cycle. I fought to receive help and in January (?) I got a therapist who specializes in eating disorders, and then in March I fought for a dietician. I say fought because my family hardly understands my issues, but I am not going into that today.The first four months of recovery was slow but very progressive. I was using an ED app that connects with your dietician, striving for x balanced meals, and really focusing on my mental health and hunger cues. But slowly I became more overwhelmed and drifted away from my recovery. I did not relapse, but I was in no way really progressing or even trying. This obviously affected many aspects of my life, including my eating patterns. So, it is going on four months of this limbo and I have become very frustrated. In the beginning, the pause in my recovery was beneficial as I was dealing with other factors of my mental health, but now they are in the works I feel the desire to continue with recovery but,,, I do not feel as motivated. I need intensive treatment but I am only seeing my therapist and dietician (alternating weeks) for one hour each week. One hour of support. I am grateful for them but at the same time that feeling of support vanishes quickly through the next 6-9 days. I feel lost. I feel like I am doing this completely myself. It is so hard to do this all my own while tackling other responsibilities: my job, school work, college applications, other aspects of my mental health, and more. I discussed this with my therapist and she recommended a treatment center and I quickly applied. They gave me a call and with that I got a feeling the center is mainly catered to those just starting recovery or trying to. I'm almost 8 months into recovery and my mindset has changed drastically. So, even if they try to provide me a treatment plan it may not be beneficial (plus the place is an hour away and they mentioned me having to do 9 hours of group a week). Physical affects of my limbo has been the decrease in meals. I am not intentionally skipping meals, however, I believe the stress, frustration, and my chaotic eating patterns have a big part of my appetite. I worry how I may be harming my body but I also feel very hopeless in my recovery. This led to lots of stomach pains, especially when I eat after a long time, but even with that I cannot find the strength to help myself. I type this all out simply because I feel very alone in this. I have very little support and I feel like I am never going to recover.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,10/12/2020-10:14pm","Hi, thank you for posting.

205,10/11/2020,AmIreadytotrain?,panwan,"Hello, I have been experiencing disordered eating for about ten years, since the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. With diabetes, I always need to count carbs to adjust insulin doses, so I must always be aware of what I eat.I was seeing a psychologist focused on type diabetes for about 6 months and she really helped me a lot with perfectionism, doing some kind of CBT and exposure type therapy to certain foods I wouldn´t allow myself to eat and then I had a bit of a setback (no details bc of triggers) and stopped going to her basically because I wanted to continue with disordered eating and didn´t want to listen to her. Luckily, her voice stayed in my head for months and I have been eating much better and healthily these last two months. The biggest hurdle was the stop of all record keeping of blood sugar, exercise and food consumption. As a diabetic, this record keeping, especially when problems with blood sugar crop up, is kind of helpful. You can see trends and change insulin dosage, etc.I am much more relaxed about everything over the last couple of months, but this has always come and gone over the years, and I am afraid I am going to fall back into old habits, as those same intrusive thought keep popping into my head. I would love to start training for a virtual half-marathon, but that means I would have to start keeping track of kms run and a lot of my food intake before and during runs, as knowing how food affects my blood sugar is imperative for my safety, especially for long runs. I am trying not to include any kind of triggering information so I dont really know if this is well explained enough, but after dealing with this disordered eating, will I be able to be take up training to do this again for races? I really miss running races and having fitness goals. For now, I dont use any fitness apps, I save nothing in my Garmin, I dont know how many km I run, I keep no Excel spreadsheets. These are all things I did quite compulsively when I was very into my disordered eating.Should I wait longer to try doing this? I have been ""normal"" since mid-August.",recoveryj,"Mon,10/12/2020-11:16am","I can definitely relate with the compulsivity when it comes to counting, keeping track, etc. That’s one of the biggest hurdles of my ED since it overlaps with my OCD. I also relate to wanting to move again! I was a swimmer before ED, and there are definitely days I miss that.
Are you still seeing a therapist? This would definitely be something to bring up. If not, I’d highly recommend seeking someone out who specializes in EDs. I know that going back to certain behaviors can be incredibly triggering, especially so early in recovery. I’d also recommend seeking out a dietician who specializes in eating disorders. Not only can they help you make sure you don’t “over-do” it if you do end up training, but they can also help you come up with a meal plan that meets your needs in regards to ED recovery, diabetes, and even training! If you don’t know where to find someone, I’d look at some of the resources NEDA provides. They can help you find specialists in your area.
Congratulations on your recovery. Keep on staying strong <3",panwan,"Mon,10/12/2020-12:28pm","Jules, Thank you so much for your advice. I stopped seeing my psychologist, was considering seeing her again, but then thinking, well maybe I should just try to do it myself. I am just in the last couple of weeks getting these intrusive thoughts and I recognize them this time, as how things start back up again.
I know when I am not having these thoughts and then following through with restricting and tracking behaviours, I feel free and I am a much nicer person to be around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
206,09/28/2020,Notsickenough...,hermione3,I feel so invalidated because my blood work came back normal. It has not been the past few weeks I also now feel invincible. I was supposed to fast before and I had a drink not water so could have played a role on some things it just makes me feel not sick enough. I also don’t feel thin enough. I know labs change day to day but I just feel not sick enough..,Annet,"Mon,09/28/2020-11:07pm","Do you know that it is common that when people have eating disorders they labs are ""normal""?

As ED patients we never feel ""sick enough"". But ""sick enough"" is another lie that our eating disorder tells to us. So, keep fighting against it.

Please stay safe and take care.",Annet,"Wed,10/07/2020-11:20pm","I think you are in a moment of dispair and it would be good if you could talk to your therapist/doctor in person.
I want you to know that we all have a healthy self and an eating disorder self. I am sure you sometimes feel like there are 2 people inside you: one that wants to recover and another one that wants to continue using behaviors. Well, I have always been ambivalent about recovery BUT the trick is to strengthen your healthy-self. Give more power to the actions that lead to recovery. Start ignoring your eating disorder urges. Little by little, you will become used to have a healthier life style.Remember, we do not get rid of our ED overnight. It took us several years to develop it and it may take us several years to get rid of it. BUT we need to keep trying. I am sure you are strong and brave. Keep trying. You deserve a better life.Hugs
Annet",hermione3,"Fri,10/09/2020-5:40pm",Thank you for the support yes some days I want to recover others I just don’t care and use behaviors. I am exhausted today but going to try to at least eat something and not purge as hard as that is.,Annet,"Sun,10/11/2020-12:02am","The more you practice healthy behaviors, the easier they will become. Start with something small and simple you can commit to. Once you have dominated that little or big thing, set another objective that is recovery focused.Ambivalence will always be there. But always question what your mind is telling you and give yourself an objective answer. You will notice our ED mind is pretty distorted and it lies to us A LOT.Hugs

207,10/05/2020,StartingtoNoticeWeightGain,yoyokay,"I have finally started to gain some weight and though I am still very underweight, I really want to stop adding any more. Everyone is telling me that I am still unhealthy and need to gain weight, but now that I do not look as “near-death” skinny as I did, I feel so anxious. I feel like I am not being restrictive enough and need to start exercising daily again. I feel at a constant battle within myself of wanting to let myself enjoy food that I crave vs. thinking I am just being slobbish for even enjoying any foods, and that I need self-disclipline through controlling my calorie intake and limiting less healthy foods. I just feel like I am okay to maintain this weight and not keep gaining, because I do feel a bit better, but Idk if I really believe that or if it is just the ED trying to stop me from letting go of ED behaviors. I want to be healthy but I also want to be content in my body, which I never was before I lost weight. I don’t want to gain everything back after I worked so hard to lose it.",recoveryj,"Mon,10/05/2020-12:35pm","I can tell you from experience that it is 100% ED trying to creep back into your life with those anxieties. Don’t let it win. You deserve so much more. One of the most impactful things I’ve heard is that if you’re having to restrict, deny yourself, or over exert yourself; you will never find happiness in your body because you are actively fighting it. If you are restricting in order to “maintain”, that is a sign that it is not the set point for you. That can be so difficult to feel in a society that capitalizes on our insecurities and telling us we aren’t enough. But the truth is, we are; everyone is. Without body diversity, there would be no beauty. Without body diversity, there would be less to love about humanity. We all have our own unique qualities, and those are what give us beauty. Weight has absolutely nothing to do with it. You don’t have to fight your body to be beautiful; you already are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
208,09/30/2020,breakfast,Miggi,"School has just started for me, and now my schedule is compacted. I will eat breakfast at 6:30 and lunch at 11:30, and I was able to keep up with this in recovery. But lately I feel fat and self conscious because all my friends don't eat breakfast. I feel so fat and bloated all the time, and I feel tired if i don't eat breakfast, but i'm sure i'd get used to it. I just can't stop thinking that if I skipped breakfast I could exercise instead of eat in that time during the morning. I have a kind of early lunch and am not that hungry come lunch time, but if I skip I know I will be hungry by 1, but I can't eat then at school. I feel so torn, should I eat breakfast?",Annet,"Wed,09/30/2020-10:53pm","I know the feeling!!!! Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. So, YES! You should eat it.
However, if you feel it is too early to have it, maybe you can have something lighter.
With regards to your comment of not feeling hungry enough at lunch time and having to eat when not hungry,  I will tell you what my therapist told to me once that I mentioned something similar to her.
She said: ""So, you think you should not eat when you are not hungry, right? What happens to patients that are in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) in comma if they do not eat? They do not feel hungry...""
You know the answer, don't you? If those patients are not artificially fed, they die... So, even when we do not move at all (do not exercise) and even when we are not hungry, our body needs to eat.Your new timetable will not last forever.

It also sounds like your friends may be dealing with their own issues with EDs. Breakfast helps our bodies get a jump start on the day - there’s a reason you feel so much more tired if you skip! It’s your body’s way of telling you that it needs energy, it needs nourishment to keep going! I can relate to schedule changes being stressful though. I know I am thrown way out of whack if my usual times shift! Are you working with a dietician who specializes in EDs? If not, please, please try to find someone in your network. They can be so helpful for navigating these types of changes and making sure you’re getting your body what you need! You deserve it; you are worthy of healing. And like Annet said, everyone needs food. You done have to “earn” a single bite. You’ve done enough just by being here. You are enough <3",weouthere,"Thu,10/01/2020-9:50am","I’ll save you the experimentation time: skipping breakfast won’t make you lose weight. I skipped breakfast for most of middle school and high school thinking it would do something. All it did was worsen my ed and self image, and not do what I wanted it to do. Eat a breakfast that makes you feel good every day. It’s so important, especially when you’re in school. I’m a senior in college and now I know that skipping breakfast makes it so much harder to concentrate and do my work the rest of the day. Not only that, but food will be on your mind all day even further keeping you from the important things you have to do like get an education. It’s hard at first, but it DOES get easier. You got this!!!",only_human,"Sun,10/04/2020-1:43pm","I also vote for breakfast. I know that if I don't eat breakfast I can't stop thinking about the fact that I haven't had breakfast for the rest of the day. My ED thoughts around food and exercise intensify, making life so much more stressful. It is far easier to eat a decent breakfast, even if it's mentally difficult in the moment, than have ED thoughts raging all day. If you stick to your routine of breakfast, lunch, snacks and so on then it will become less of a big deal. You won't think to question eating these meals and snacks and you'll be able to get on with school and everything else in life.
Keep going! You're doing great :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It just scares me.,only_human,"Sun,10/04/2020-1:32pm","It may not feel like it, but that is an achievement! Going against what your eating disorder is telling you to do (or not do) is really hard and feels awful. However, if things feel really difficult and uncomfortable, it's a sign you're doing the right thing. It means you are moving towards recovery and taking control over your eating disorder.Eating and sitting with the food takes practice. The more you do it, the easier it gets over time. That's easy to say though, but harder to accept. When I am dealing with having eating and experiencing ED thoughts I find that writing about these thoughts helps. It's like ranting, getting it all off my chest and then I can challenge them with healthy, recovery-based thoughts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m sorry to hear about the departure of your dietician, but I’m glad that you won’t be without support. Alterations in a treatment team can feel jarring, especially when they’ve become such a constant presence in your life. I think it’s helpful to remember that the recovery process isn’t a straight line and that it entails many different twists and changes over time—this switch might be one of them. It’s painful not having someone you’ve trusted for a while to support you and it might take time to lessen that pain. It might help to think back on what you’ve gained from working with your previous dietician and what you could hope to gain from your new professional’s perspective.

Maybe it would be helpful to write down some thoughts about that fear: What is being attached to those foods that make you fearful? Is it ED? Where are those thoughts coming from?
Often, fear exists to protect us. But when it comes to EDs and anxiety, that protective mechanism goes haywire and causes us to fear things that can actually be beneficial and nourishing. Maybe exploring and breaking down some of those fears will help you on your recovery path",recoveryj,"Fri,09/25/2020-7:39am","Maybe it’s time to explore why you are having such mixed and complex feelings about a gift that was sent with love. There are “good” or “bad” foods. So where is the fear coming from? Does it have something to do with a past experience? Or is it coming from the toxic diet culture that pervades so much of society?
I’m sorry you’re feeling gross. You deserve so much more. You deserve to be able to accept this gift and nourish yourself! Not only is ED depriving you of something you like, it is taking away being able to accept loving gifts. Eating is not bad. There is nothing morally wrong with any food. Everything has its place.

With people that do know, I try to be comforted by the fact that maybe they'll understand and be forgiving. Plus I know it feels weird to apologize for something like that but still I think it's worthwile.Brief random thought -- I think the interpersonal significance of food in mainstream culture is fascinating, even across cultures. In general, we try to feed each other almost past what's appropriate (you know, the traditional grandmotherly figure who always wants you to eat one more bite), and we're offended when people rebuff those attempts -- it's like refusing a hug, or something.

Food represents community and survival. It represents comfort and strength. It represents care and love. That is what I see in both these situations with grandparents - extensions of love and care at the most basic level. One of the most insidious factors of EDs is that they strip us of that culture, that connection. EDs not only take away the pleasure of food and the good feelings of a strong, nourished body, but they strip away our culture. In the place of care, connection, safety, comfort, and love, we are left with fear, self-doubt, guilt, and shame. There is no comfort in the “culture” ED tries to provide. It leaves it disconnected and alone. And yet, it is so strong and draws us in so easily. What keeps us going back? Why is the fear of allowing ourselves to réengage in our true culture so strong? Those are questions we may never have answers to, but that is why we fight. That is why we fight those ED thoughts, fears, and behaviors. That is why we fight the toxic messages of “diet culture” in the media. That is why we fight for recovery. To regain our culture. To regain our identity. To regain our connections, care, and love. To regain ourselves. I wish you both strength to keep fighting against the ED fears. Maybe next time something like this happens, take a deep breath before responding.

Secrets are where EDs fester and grow. In fact, it is your ED trying to keep this secret right now. Your best bet at being able to recover without residential is actually being open and telling your dietician about what’s been going on. The longer the secret it kept, the worse it grows. Also, it could even be preventing you from experiencing the effects of the new treatment. I know that may sound odd, but our bodies don’t react the way we expect them to when we aren’t taking care of and nourishing them. I urge you to be open with your team.

217,09/21/2020,Wanttogiveupsobadly,weouthere,I had my yearly appointment with my pediatrician today and things didn’t go well. I politely asked the nurse not to tell me my weight and she complied but when the doctor came in she immediately mentioned that I’ve gained weight since March (when I started trying to eat intuitively) and told me the number. I’m really upset and I don’t know what to do. I knew I gained weight but I was doing better not knowing the number. The pediatrician doesn’t know about my ed because I am self treating. I want so badly to stop eating again. I thought intuitive eating was supposed to be good for you and help your body image but all I’ve done is gain since I started even though I was already above a normal weight. I just want to give up.,recoveryj,"Mon,09/21/2020-10:33am","I’m so sorry your doctor was so inappropriate and invasive. That is absolutely uncalled for. It makes me so upset when doctors don’t listen to what their patients say! Because I am very much the same way - I do much better without knowing my weight. The way I think about it, no matter what the number is, I won’t be happy. So why torture myself with looking at is and obsessing? When we are able to eat intuitively, as you say you’ve been working on, our bodies will find the weight that allows us to function to the best of our ability and stay well and safe. Just like height, our bodies have a number in mind for weight. Sometimes that number can fluctuate if we need to heal from damage that’s been done, and that’s okay too. What your doctor did was not okay. I’m so sorry. I wish I could go back in time and erase that number! Just remember you are so, so much more. And you owe it to yourself to keep fighting and keep nourishing. Because you are worthy. You deserve to be free
Stay strong <3
Julesthefox",weouthere,"Mon,09/21/2020-1:13pm","You’re right, no matter what the number is I will never be satisfied. It’s just hard to hear it said out loud. The doctor asked me if I was eating enough fruits and vegetables so that definitely didn’t help either. I’m going grocery shopping and I’m going to try to pick up more. It’s hard to shop for myself rather than my ED after hearing that, but I will do my best. Thank you for hearing me out and giving advice without judgement.",Purple65,"Mon,09/21/2020-10:37pm","Your story really hit home. When I was a young teen (pre-teen), my pediatrician did almost exactly the same thing as what you experienced. The difference was that my mother told them please make no comment on my weight, yet he came in and said I was slightly overweight. I went through several ED episodes. Just last year, my PCP forced me to get weighed. Again, I was slightly overweight. Now I am not because I frantically 'corrected' that, but 10 months later (at 55 years old) I have an ED again",weouthere,"Tue,09/22/2020-7:51am","Wow, I didn’t realize that this was such a common thing. I’m so sorry that happened to you too. Doctors don’t realize how damaging those comments can be for someone with an ed. It really can send someone who’s been recovered for years into a relapse. I’m barely hanging on by a thread at this point. It makes me not want to go back to a doctor lol. Anyway I really hope things get better for both of us.

218,08/01/2020,PossiblehealthissuesbcofED,citrusfriend,"(Tw: mention of previous suicide attempt via starvation, covid, physical problems caused by ED, relapsing, and police brutality) So I've been dealing with disordered eating since I was 8 and sporadically restricted enough for it to be an actual disorder. Two years ago, though, it got bad. Like, lose-a-lot-of-weight-going-bald-sleeping-too-much kind of bad. The Bad Period lasted about 8 months, but I've had small relapses (lasted a couple weeks at most) since then. I see a therapist every week, but I rarely talk to him about my ED. I've never been to a dietitian or doctor or anything for it. But ever since I started my recovery after those Bad 8 Months, I've been having issues with my digestive system. At the very beginning, I would puke and get diarrhea often. That petered off after 3 months or so, but I still have issues with my digestive system and bouts of extreme pain. I feel like the pain has been getting worse, and want to go to the doctor, but bc my last doctor was an awful person, I need to get a new one. And now, with the pandemic and impending American civil war, I'm stressed and the urge to restrict is getting worse and worse. Any time I accidentally miss a meal time, I find myself not eating for the rest of the day. I still feel hunger, which is good, but nothing looks or tastes good anymore. How do I even explain this to a doctor so she'll understand? I don't want a dietitian; I feel like it would be counterproductive for me. The Bad Period was caused by someone briefly trying to control my diet and me reacting disproportionately to it. I think I would have a similar reaction to a dietitian. But maybe that's the ED talking, idk. I just want the doctor to fix the fucking pain. I just want the doctor to tell me that I didn't destroy myself. I'm so afraid of everything constantly bc of the pandemic, bc of the political climate. Tanks rolled down the street next to my work today. I'm so terrified and I'm tired of being terrified that I'm dying bc of what I've done to my body, but I'm also terrified that I'll go through my trauma-induced fear of doctors, only to be told that I can't be trusted with my diet either. I think I'm afraid a doctor will take away my choice and right now I feel like a lot of my choices have been stolen already. I don't trust doctors, I can't. Idk. I'm so tired and I'm so scared. When my eating disorder was bad two years ago, it only got so bad bc it quickly became a way to hurt myself. It was just an 8 long month suicide attempt. And now that I've finally learned to want to live, everything is trying to kill me. Covid could kill me. Cops could kill me. Feds could kill me. My partner goes to the protests and if she dies there, that would kill me. And I'm so terrified that I've killed me too, that my desperate attempt two years ago is a time-delayed success. I don't want the doctor to give me a dietitian to fix me, but I think I'm more terrified that they wont be able to fix me at all. I know I'm probably overreacting. I don't actually think this will kill me, which is why I haven't gone to the doctor before now. But now, I'm so goddamn scared of everything that I can't stop catastrophizing bc with covid and the police, my worst fears turned out to be underestimations of what our reality would become. And even if this doesn't kill me, what if there's still permanent damage? I'm schrodinger's ailment and I'm afraid of finding out what's there. I can't take being told this pain will last forever. I can't take being told I'm going to die. I'm not strong enough for that, not anymore, but I'm not strong enough for this limbo to last forever either.",recoveryj,"Sat,08/01/2020-7:44am","I can relate to so much of what you’re saying. It feels like the world is trying to strip away what little “control” and choice we have. But the reality is, we are not in control. And I think you’re not giving yourself enough credit for how amazing and strong you are. You have been through so much, and now the world seems to be falling apart.
If there is one thing I know for sure, it’s that you are worthy. And you are enough. You are deserving of the care you need, whatever that may be. I understand the fear and trauma around doctors - once when I was inpatient, doctors were actively starving me. But know that there are so many more out there that understand and can help you. Maybe try by opening up to your therapist about ED and your fears. They can help direct you to places and people who understand and can get you what you need. So many just don’t get EDs; it’s important to find the professionals that do.
On that note, the NEDA website also has a directory of resources and can connect you with people in your area.
I know it feels terrifying to give up control. But if your fear around your behaviors is this great, is it really you controlling your diet, or the ED controlling you?
I think I’m everyone’s recovery, giving up that control is the most difficult step and process. Just know that as you allow yourself to relax more around that, you’ll find that you’ll be able to trust your body again to signal you about its needs. Rediscovering your relationship with your body will help you better understand not only what you need, but maybe why you are experiencing pain.
One of my biggest issues was denial - I’ve had a few health problems in the past related to ED, but I’d deny that they had anything to do with it. I was so desperate to find another answer so I didn’t have to give up that control. Only when I finally allowed myself to admit to my behaviors and open myself up to change was I able to heal.
Do I still struggle? Absolutely. Especially now. Please know you are so not alone in your fears. COVID and the fight against systemic oppression is taking its toll on everyone. One hope I try to hold is that this may finally lead to change. I hope this is a revolution, and I will continue to fight until it is.
This fight needs you too. Just to be. You are enough, no matter what. Taking care of yourself and getting the help you need is an act of revolution. And an act you are worthy of. You deserve love, care, and healing. Please try to reach out; find someone who specializes in EDs so you can continue to fight the good fight. You are a warrior. And you are so much stronger than you know.Julesthefox",citrusfriend,"Thu,09/24/2020-2:12am",I don't know how to tell you how much this response means to me. Just... thank you for this.

221,09/18/2020,mymomisstoppingmyrecovery,marierecovers44,"guys please help me this is really bringing me down. I'm 14, female btw.
I suffered from a very restrictive mindset when it came to food (obsessive calorie counting, weighing X a day, losing too much weight..) I developed this ED in quarantine and a few months ago I started my recovery journey. I'm still in the middle of it but I stopped counting, weighing myself and forcing myself to work out. no, I have not gotten rid of all the bad thoughts and no, I'm still not perfectly happy with myself and no, I cannot always eat everything and not feel bad. But I'm not done yet and I have worse days and better days which is perfectly normal. The thing is, my mom really contributes to the disordered thoughts because she has them herself but she doesn't admit it.
Her daily calorie intake is probably about X a day which is not enough.
when I want to cook for her, there's always some comment like ""is it full fat?"" ""how much X did you use?"" ""could we have less of that and rather have a X on the side?""
or when I wanted to make breakfast for us in the morning: ""I don't like having so many X for breakfast""
also, typical phrases:
""I feel like a whale"" (then she eats even less)
""oopsie, might have not eaten enough today""
""I'm not a sweets, baked goods person"" (I know she likes them)
and she orders X at restaurants, rarely has desserts or shares them, only eats tiny portions at events and the list goes on. she also doesn't want me to bake anything because she ""can't restrain herself it it's there"".
a few days ago we were in the car for a 5h ride, she'd eaten X. says she's hungry, eats X. like, how am I supposed to feel good about my eating habits when she eats half of what I eat and constantly complains about how much she overeats or her weight.
and yes, I've talked to her about it many times but she just says that she needs less and that it's none of my business.
The thing is, she always tells me EXACTLY what and how much she's had that day (kind of disordered) even if I tell her to stop and she gets super annoyed and mad when I tell her to eat more.

222,09/12/2020,DoIhaveanEd??,Lilyj,I want to start by saying that I didn’t know what category to put this in. I don’t want to trigger anyone so please don’t read this if you are not comfortable with it. I don’t know if I have an eating disorder or not and I don’t know who else to ask. Here is my story: it started off with just wanting to lose some weight and be healthier even tho I was already at a healthy weight. I started restricting and trying to measure and count all my calories as much as I could. In the beginning there were nights when I would fall asleep thinking about what I was going to eat the next day. I would also exercise frequently but not excessively. Then it moved to puking up my food when I ate too much( small binges) but it was hard so I stopped. Lately I’ve been in a cycle where I eat healthy(sorta restrict but not really) for a couple days and then binge. I’ve binged the last 3 nights and tonight I puked up a small amount. I eat with my family because I really do love food so I can never go long with super healthy eating. I’ve been binging a lot lately but i want so badly to be skinny. It’s not obsessive but once I start binging it’s like I can’t stop. Then the next day I  restrict  and then binge. I’ve read about Ed’s online and it’s like I have a small amount of every disorder. But I also feel like I don’t have one and I’m just being unhealthy. Please give me advice.,_admin_moderator,"Sat,09/12/2020-12:24pm","Hi LilyJ,We are glad to see you reaching out to the forums, we hope you find all the support you are looking for here.

Stay safe, take care and remember that recovery is possible!",horseshoecrab,"Mon,09/21/2020-1:31am","Eating disorders look all kinds of ways. I remember when I was little I had this really specific idea of what an eating disorder must be, and I could never understand how they could ever happen. Like why do healthy people want to lose weight? Why do thin people feel the need to get even thinner? And then I was the healthy person, and the thin person, and it's still odd and mystifying but very very real. Your brain is complicated.We cannot diagnose on the forums, but it sounds to me like what you're describing falls under an ED category. Although it's true that there's some normalized binge/purging in the world (read: Christmas, followed by gym New Year's resolutions), but not really puking, and you seem to have hit all the ED marks. Your story is familiar... also it's much, much, better to think you have an ED when you don't than to pretend like nothing is wrong.I wouldn't worry too much about ""which"" eating disorder you have. For me they have always kind of gone together, and I think that's true for a lot of people. Disordered eating habits are slippery.There's so much advice about this in the world, and you'll probably hear all of it over and over again. One important thing, though, is that binging and purging is a cycle, and it's your body trying to protect you. You force yourself not to eat, so you're starving, and then when you do allow yourself food your body is literally trying to get as much energy as it can because it knows that tomorrow there might not be any. The best way not to binge is not to restrict, but that's a hard thing. I've been there so many days, still am a lot of the time.Man there's so much I want to say. Having a thin body isn't all it's cracked up to be, sometimes healthy is just being able to let go. I don't know the ins and outs of your situation, but I feel for you.NEDA is right, it would probably be wise to talk to a professional about this. Best of luck, and the forums are here if you ever need anything (or, you know, just to scream into the void).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
223,09/19/2020,Relapseafterbeingsick?,Stampo,"Hello everyone, I'm new here just didn't know where to turn..
I have recovered from anorexia about a year ago. I have been maintaining my weight and my mental health was better than ever.
The thing is, I was very sick (got the flu) this month and couldn't stomach food for a couple of days. Since then I feel a lot more worried about my weight, i feel more anxiety and have thoughts that i didn't have for quite a while.. at the same time i'm extremely hungry and so to not restrict I'm responding to it and eating alot more than usual which of course makes me worried about eating too much.
Does it sound like a relapse? How do i stop this? I'm scared..
Thank you:(",march26,"Sun,09/20/2020-10:52pm","I've heard it said that with problems like ours, we are always in recovery. That being said, we will probably continue to struggle with ED thoughts, albeit with less frequency.
Perhaps this is just a weak moment for you. Make sure you keep honoring what your body needs. food is fuel to live, remember.
Also remember, this is just a weak moment, and it will get better. But it will get worse if you fall now. You can do this, in whatever way possible. hugs and i believe in u :)) you got this XD >.<",horseshoecrab,"Mon,09/21/2020-1:08am","If you didn't eat food for a few days because you couldn't stomach it, your body is probably craving nutrition. That doesn't mean you're overeating -- it's natural and it's just your body taking good care of you. Also it's hard to think straight when you're either sick or hungry or both -- if you've restricted before then you probably know that. Being sick is also really stressful, or at least it is for me, and sometimes you can retreat into ED thoughts because they feel safe when you're nervous. I've had this exact thing happen to me (Not being able to eat can feel familiar To which I have to remind myself that I don't actually *want* to be restricting) but it passed for me fairly easily when my body/health/routine was back to normal.Be patient with yourself. Let your body get its feet back under it and everything should feel a little easier. Even if it is a relapse, if you do get back into a cycle of thoughts/behaviors, you will get through it -- you know what recovery feels like and I can almost promise it will work itself out.Be well <3",recoveryj,"Mon,09/21/2020-7:41am","I would agree that sometimes situations like that can be very triggering for ED thoughts. But you have what it takes to fight them! And right now, I wouldn’t worry too much about “over-eating”. If it’s been difficult to keep things down, that sounds more like your body’s response to get the nutrition it needs to heal. Sickness can be traumatic on the body, whether we see it or not. If you are anxious and concerned, I would highly recommend reaching out to a therapist or dietician who specializes in EDs just to make sure tou stay on the right track. Having the awareness you have is a huge step. You are doing amazing. Try to be gentle with yourself during this hard time and allow yourself to meet your body’s needs.

I've had an (undiagnosed) eating disorder 2 years ago, when I was 14/15 and a lot of weight due to not eating enough (I was nevee undeeweight tho) . I also lost my period wich I had since I was 13.

I don't really remember when exactly I lost my period, because cycle got messed up in the proces, but I was whitout it for 12-15 months. Somewhre in that period of time I startwd to eat more again and gained some of my weight back. Period retuened with it and I was soooo happy. I got 2 normal periods before it went missing again... Now is going to be fifth month since my lass period ans I'm verey scared. Nothing has changed since the las one what can I be possibly doing wrong..?

I hate to say this but the break I had to take, due to Covid, was a saving grace for me. I had been suffering from from my carpel in left hand from a long term assignment where the students would leave a mess of books on the floor by the end of every 6th period class. The other 2nd job in retail made my carpel even worse in having to re-hang, collect clothing repeatedly from the store floors, and also dressing room duty just made my carpel even worse. Then from exhaustion b4 CV-19 break I kind of missed the wall and fell on my buttocks instead w/ my bad left hand saving my back. All these combined led to my near work exhaustion. The last few months i had worked i had also earned the most money and also had felt the most exhausted ever. So with the CV-19 break and in finding a new 2nd job and not teaching onsite just yet; in this spare time i have been able to breath in, and breath out, and take the time to thank God that I am still standing strong. In spite of my ""Shortfalls"" I am still a CV free person... My new job has me taking breaks every 2.5 hrs and so I am eating more regularly, have time to walk in between work shifts, on my days off. I also have improved my home ec skills for stove top cooking. I am more aware of the types of food which i put into my shopping cart as i walk home w/ 2 arms of groceries 2x a week. I can only carry so much w/ my lame left hand, and my neck and back issues as well. for the pain I'm in.

Recovery is hard and we do not always have the money for treatment. In my early 20's, all ED professionals that saw me recommended my family to send me inpatient. However, my parents could not do it. Then, when I started working, they sent me again to hospital but my salary was not enough to afford it.

236,09/05/2020,wanttogiveupsobadly,fightingbee,i can't gain any more weight. I just don't want this anymore. I can't take the thought of having a larger body again and feel so bad already. Hate enjoying eating so much and feeling so greedy. is recovery even worth it? why would I want a bigger body and a life free of control and compulsions if there's nothing to really look forward to?,recoveryj,"Sat,09/05/2020-7:34am","I’m sorry you’re feeling so down. To answer your question; YES. Yes recovery is worth it. And even more, YOU are worth it. Whose idea was it that a larger body is “less attractive”? In my experience, beauty has absolutely nothing to do with size. Unfortunately, society has pushed the narrative that we need to be small, to take up the least amount of space. Do you know why? So they can control us. So they can make money. Literally the entire diet industry designs its “products” to fail so that people will feel like they have to keep coming back, keep buying more. Society has told us that we are worthless, and yet if we were to rebel and accept and embrace the wholeness of ourselves, the industry would crumble. They oppress us because they are scared of the power we have. Because the truth is, we don’t need any diet or product to be worthy or beautiful. We don’t need to be smaller. In fact, we deserve to take up space. We deserve to have our needs met. We deserve to have our feelings felt and our voices heard. You deserve that. I know it’s hard to see, especially right now. But maybe take this time to unpack the feelings around what it means to you to have a “bigger body”. What makes that so scary? What feels most uncomfortable? And where is that fear and discomfort really coming from? The authentic you is underneath all that fear and pain. The you that knows you have so much potential and so much to live for. The you that’s free from the bonds of ED. The you that knows you’re beautiful.
Sending love. You are never alone

The thing is - i think I am very fatphobic (unfortunately.I wish I weren't :( ) And I just really don't like the way I looked in a healthy body.

Here's the thing though: people with active anorexia are very, very afraid of being any bigger, no matter how much danger they're in. And you can still be active in your eating disorder, and still in grave danger, even after you've restored weight.That's because the part of the brain that perceives your body is the last thing to recover after you've regained some of your health. It's a cruel trick, but your brain changes when you lose enough weight. It takes a while to get it back. But it does come. I'm 71 years old. I have relapsed, and relapsed, and relapsed, and relapsed. My last relapse was this past spring because of COVID. I didn't even recognize what was happening, I just knew I wanted to be in control of the world around me and I couldn't be. So I decided, not realizing it, I would control the only thing I could.When I realized this time around is that when I am in relapse, I look funny. I think I look fantastic, I think I'm in complete control of everything that is burdening me. This time wasn't like that. I caught myself in the mirror and I could honestly see that I looked scary.I didn't want to gain weight either. I never do. I know I will get to the point where you are where I will be screaming at myself, my shrink, my nutritionist, and my doctor that I can't do it anymore. That I can't stand feeling this way, I can't stand looking this way, I want to just stop eating all this damn food.My eating disorder will always have plenty of blah-blah-blah to say, and it will always be trying to get me to listen. So will yours. And I know how your recovering body feels. It's uncomfortable. I remember that so well, and I'm dreading it this time around. Really dreading it.If you can, for just a moment, move away from feelings related to your size. Think about the things you love doing and are good at. Think about the things that make your life wonderful that you can only enjoy when you're healthy. I bet you had these things once. I bet your eating disorder took them from you. You can have them back.If you are young, you have so much life ahead of you. If you aren't young, you still have beautiful surprises ahead. You can't know what they are, but they're coming as long as you're strong enough to open your arms and meet them. I wish someone had said these things to me decades ago. I hope you can hear them a little bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
237,09/07/2020,Weightrestorationandsevereemotionalstress,grievingpianist,"Hi everyone,I guess you could say I'm an anomaly. I'm 71 years old, and I've suffered with anorexia for about six decades. I relapsed because I was so triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. I simply felt too out of control, and I didn't realize that I was losing weight.Now, at the order of my medical team, I am tasked with the really difficult work of weight restoration. I remember it being very, very hard (11 years ago I spent six weeks in an eating disorder residential program, and many years ago I was hospitalized numerous times.)This time, I'm doing it solo with a lot of medical guidance. This being a holiday weekend, I'm completely by myself. I'm so frightened. I can't stop shaking, can't control my thoughts, and when my stomach hurts from constipation I really, really can't make myself eat — although I'm supposed to do that no matter what.I'm in a program somewhat like AA, but it's not a place where I can really talk about this (the focus is entirely different, and it wouldn't be appropriate). I'm going to an eating disorders anonymous meeting on Zoom later today. I'm praying that it is still in existence.Too many people, especially my boyfriend and some of the meeting folks I talk with by phone -- respond by wanting to ""fix"" this — suggesting foods I might try, suggestions like ""just eat more"". They mean well. But as most of you probably know it's not something you go out and fix by tinkering with the way you would a car that isn't running right. It's so much more spiritual. It's so much more all-encompassing and vague.I'm so grateful that this form is here. I never thought I would need it again (I really believed I was done with relapses). Then we all got hit by a pandemic. The monster is out again.I would love to hear from you, regardless of your age.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,09/08/2020-6:47am","Hi grievingpianist - you mentioned some symptoms that are concerning.

I'm relieved, but that doesn't mean these days alone with all this fear don't feel absolutely terrible sometimes. The good news is that (yay!) I've restored a little bit of weight. The feeling I have about this is that my irrational reactions (YOU'RE GOING TO GET FAT!) may be overwhelming, but they don't have a vote in all this. The doctors do. My healthy self does. My eating disorder needs to go sit somewhere and shut up. Weight restoration and weight gain are two different things.I'm grateful for your concern, which I completely understand. I don't like how this feels. I never have. It's super-scary, it was super-scary when I was in a residential treatment program, it was super-scary when I was a teenager, and throughout all of my relapses during my life.If the tremors continue, I will be seeing my neurologist.

I think I am medically stable my labs are five I am just chronically dehydrated and well have been slipping a little eating disorder wise.

I function I go to work I still am social I am like a functional depressed person which makes me feel invalid. I am also very self destructive and have urges that are not good. I know I need a medication change but di I need to do it in a hospital...that seems extreme I am not that sick...,Blue44,"Wed,09/09/2020-7:46am",I suggest that you follow the recommendations of your team of doctors.

Take care,hermione3,"Wed,09/09/2020-6:29pm",Thanks for the support. I am hoping to have a conference with my medical doctor and psychiatrist Friday to discuss it. My therapist also feels I need a medication change so everyone wants it. If I really need ru go in the hospital to do it I guess I would it wouldn’t be a long stay I hope if it’s just medication. But hopefully I can do it outpatient but we will see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mostly just posting to this to have some level of accountability out in the world and make sure I am not retreating into secretive behaviors.

247,08/31/2020,BulimiaRecovery,radar2324,"I was bulimic for about two years. It took me about 3 months of struggling to stop before I have finally quit without going back. My weight is normal and I have completely stopped purging. Now that I am in recovery, I am noticing some symptoms that are both unexpected and unpleasant. Most importantly, I feel dizzy after some meals and when moving around a lot. I know that this is both orthostatic hypotension and related to the reaction of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) (which is over-active in bulimics). I have been in complete recover for between 3 and 4 weeks now, but still feel dizzy at least once every single day. It is agonizing. Does anyone know whether this dizziness will go away on its own? I know that sometimes hospitals treat this symptom through intravenous solutions that contain potassium. I am trying to up my potassium intake naturally through food and supplementation, but I'm not completely ""cured"" yet from this symptom. I would really like to know whether recovery from this physical symptom is just a matter of time or is real medical intervention needed.

249,08/29/2020,buzzwordsandsupport,horseshoecrab,"This is really dumb, but right now the buzzwords are oddly comforting. I had a bad night and I came on this forum, and I guess it just feels good to hear people use the ED words. Even the bad ones. I have been relapsing this past two weeks and it sucks to go back to struggling after kind of having everything under control, but I think it's also kind of freeing to be back in the support of this world. Like I can say that I'm having a relapse and everyone knows what that is, or that I'm struggling right now with binging.Sometimes my parents ask me ""How are you"" with this huge elephant in the room, but it feels so awkward talking to them sometimes because they have such a different perspective. I guess I'm just grateful that this community exists and that there's so much support.This is super off topic but my boyfriend used to do this thing where he'd ask me out of the blue for a virtual hug, and for some reason it always seemed like he asked when I was having the hardest time. I gave him some love and compliments and stuff every time, but I always used to feel like it took a chunk out of me to push my own problems aside and give him support for his. Maybe it was wrong of me to feel that way.That's like 100% what we do here, isn't it? I have never felt like that responding on this forum -- it always just feels like we're all in this together and we stick it out as best we can. I feel bad now, though.I kind of need a virtual hug right now, I think, but I don't know how to ask without calling up that memory. Maybe it shouldn't have been so hard for me to help him, I guess maybe this is what he used to feel like. But I'm lonely or something right now, I guess. I just moved to college and I'm eating all on my own and it's not going so well.",recoveryj,"Sun,08/30/2020-7:45am","I’m sorry to hear you’re struggling again. Remember that this forum is open to all - even people who are strong in recovery. In fact, it’s inspirational to hear from people who’ve been able to keep up recovery even when times get tough. Know that you can always return here for support. If you feel like resorting to ED behaviors, restricting, etc., come here first. Because we are here for you. We do understand. And you matter and deserve recovery.
I’m sorry things are getting you down right now. It’s amazing that your boyfriend feels so comfortable with you to be vulnerable like that. Have you ever thought of asking the same of him? I would imagine he would be more than glad to give you the same space to express how you’re feeling and give you that virtual hug.
Also, it sounds like you’re looking for people who understand. I know that there are actually a lot of virtual groups for ED recovery support right now, especially amidst the stress of COVID. I would highly recommend seeking them out. I’ve also found that finding people who understand and saying the words out loud helps strip ED of its power and makes recovery feel better and resisting behaviors easier. If you don’t know where to start, NEDA has a lot of resources and can help you find the support you need.
Are you seeing a therapist right now? I’d definitely recommend that too. Someone who specializes in EDs - we need that understanding. Especially with the stress of going back to college, a lot of things can pop up. You deserve space for your feelings to be expressed and heard. You deserve recovery from ED.
You can do this. You can resist the behaviors. And you belong here. We are here for you, sending you a virtual hug

I'm not seeing a therapist right now -- I had been doing so well for so long back home that when I went off to college my therapist ""released"" me. I really don't think I can get a new therapist right now because of health insurance and stuff but I can try online support groups -- I hadn't thought of that so thank you for the heads up.I always feel bad talking to people who aren't in the ED community. My dad did a really good job supporting me with the physical things/re-feeding, but the mental stuff was just so far outside his understanding that we would just talk past each other. My boyfriend was the second person I told about losing weight, but whenever I reach out to him the conversation is really abortive, like he doesn't know what to do or say and I'm trying really hard not to go too far or say anything that he doesn't want or isn't ready to hear. I guess friends/family are for general support and communities like this are for talking with, I dunno.Thanks again for the hug and for listening to my ramble :P",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yesterday I was out for a bit but haven't exercised at all and in general, I don't really exercise anymore and just go for a walk every day.. but I'm so exhausted!",recoveryj,"Sun,08/30/2020-7:54am","Are you getting enough nutrition? Sometimes in recovery, it can be difficult to tell if we’re actually meeting our bodies’ needs, since we’re so used to suppressing and ignoring them. I have a friend who’s in recovery that made a funny poem -
“If you’re tired and you know it, eat a snack!
If you’re tired and you know it eat a snack!
when hunger pulls you under, fatigue may attack!
so if you're tired and you know it, eat a snack!”I thought it was pretty funny and also relatable. I often find myself fatigued, unable to focus, or having random headaches. I try to blame literally anything else, but if I really think about it and focus on recovery, I know I’m probably hungry. It can be so hard and even scary to listen to and meet our bodies’ needs. But the more you honor your body, the easier it becomes.
Also, something I noticed in my recovery was at the beginning (and for a WHILE to be honest) I was constantly exhausted, even though I was following my meal plan. Through research, I have learned that it is because of the damage we’ve done to our bodies through ED. There is so much hurt below the surface. When we finally start nourishing ourselves again, the body can finally start healing. And that takes A TON of energy! Think of how exhausting it is when you get sick - it’s kind of the same thing. You need rest because you need to heal. Allow yourself that time. You are deserving of healing and recovery. I’m sorry it can be frustrating and scary sometimes. I definitely relate to that. Just know you are so, so worth it.
If it really gets to you, I’d highly recommend seeking out a therapist and a dietician who specialize in EDs so you can make sure you’re giving your body the nourishment it needs, and you can learn coping mechanisms for when ED urges get strong.
I hope you’re able to find healing

I think I am or should be getting enough nutrition, as I'm steadily (sometimes rapidly) gaining weight. So it should be enough. My belly is always full, even though mentally I'm always still hungry for sweets.
Your friend's poem is great! I'll remember it the next time I feel hungry. Unfortunately I can't get any snacks anyway, as I'm in treatment and have strict rules to adhere to (no food in between meal times).
I doubt my body really needs the rest.. so i'm kind of pushing myself to do more even when i'm yearning for rest... well. what you gonna do about it...

So I have a problem. I entered recovery about a year ago and I am now back at a ""healthy""weight but I have never gotten back up to my pre-ed weight that I had held for years and am still below and I am not sure whether this might be a new set-weight for my body (even though I still am active to maintain that weight). Lately I have been noticing that I am hungry a lot more (almost feels like when I went through extreme hunger). Could it still be extreme hunger even though my weight technically puts me into the ""normal"" bmi range and my body wants me to gain back to pre-ed weight (kinda scary) or could I be imagining things?",recoveryj,"Mon,08/24/2020-7:37am","It can be so difficult to trust out bodies when EDs are screaming in our heads. Congratulations on your recovery! You have come so far. It takes a lot of strength to be able to recognize and notice the signals our bodies are giving us. Remember that every body is different, and every body has a different “set point”. Try not to judge yourself based on BMI too much - it is a highly flawed and problematic system.
I have researched this a lot in my own recovery, as I tend to get myself stuck in the numbers. I learned that BMI was created by a mathematician, not a doctor. And it is not based on health, but instead on the average that was found in a very select few group of people chosen by the mathematician. It was not diverse at all. I also learned that it is arbitrary - the United States narrowed the “healthy range so people could charge more for insurance. While there are certain points that are detrimental to health, those points are different for every single body. It could be that your body is trying to tell you it needs a little more right now. And that’s okay (even though it can be terrifying). It helps to be able to talk about the feelings coming up around this with a therapist. Are you currently seeing someone? I know I wouldn’t be where I am today without mine.
You are doing amazing. And congratulations on your steps in recovery",marty2020,"Sat,08/29/2020-1:27am","Hi smllr, glad to see you reaching out to the forums for support.

It’s even more difficult too being constantly bombarded by society telling us we’re not good enough. The truth is, society will keep telling us that as long as we buy into it and give them money. Don’t let them scam you. You are so much better than that. You deserve freedom from the oppression; freedom from ED. You deserve recovery. Maybe “not being able to” is a sign of healing. Maybe it’s a sign that you’re finally fighting for you. The media doesn’t care about you. All they want is money. You are worth infinitely more than anything money could ever buy. You are beautiful. Now and always. Society has warped everyone into believing they are not enough - even those we view as “meeting the standards”. Models struggle with body image issues. It’s not a problem with you or your body. You do not need to take it out on yourself. Don’t buy into the myth. You are so much stronger.
I hope you’re able to find peace and that you’re able to see your beauty as others do, because I guarantee that people view you as beautiful.

I've been struggling for the past few days, and this guy I talk to was talking to me about a diet he recommended trying. Apparently he's doing some X ""lifestyle"". It made me feel like he recommended it because of the way my body looks. I'm still a little below a normal weight, but I've recently gained a bit due to eating every day. I feel heartbroken right now. It just happened a little while ago. I wonder what the point is of trying. Nothing is ever enough. I don't try, and people are upset. I do try and I gain a little weight as a result, and I'm given diet recommendations and exercise advice. I'm at a loss.

Try not to be too hard on yourself for mistakes. They happen in recovery. Focus on what you have to do to get back on track, like plan your meals for the next few days ahead of time. Try to treat yourself kindly. It's going to be okay. Recovery is full of mistakes, I promise. Everyone makes them. What matters is how you respond to them. Stay close to anything that makes you feel motivated or brings you joy, and just push yourself through the difficult moments. Even if you have to zone out while you eat your food and distract yourself afterwards to avoid purging. Only an example. What matters is giving your brain consistent nutrition to help repair your mental state. The lack of nutrients affects our minds and mental health, no matter how much it sucks to admit. This makes it harder to recover.

I'm now startin to not only feel but also see the changes, especially in my legs and face. I'm really struggling to accept this, as I have always loved having a thin face and smaller legs. Looking in the mirror scares me and I'm ashamed to look people in the face. How can I work on self acceptance and be less scared of my healthy, natural face? After all, I can't fight my biology forever and I'm really scared that being so unhappy with my face and my body will make me relapse once I return home. Every bit of advice is highly appreciated! Love and keep fighting, all.",jess64,"Wed,08/26/2020-7:58pm","Hi fightingbee, That is so amazing that you are in treatment and are working hard on yourself and your recovery. You deserve it! It is always hard to deal with the body changes that come with it though. I think the biggest thing is reminding yourself that your body is changing in order to help you live a long and healthy life. This way, you can be active, be healthy, boost your mood and enjoy everything your body has to offer.

255,08/25/2020,collegemealplansandoldfears,horseshoecrab,"I just moved onto the college campus as a fresham (which is exciting!) but the meal plam situation is messing me up. It's only open certain hours and I have to order meals off the menu, so I went grocery shopping instead so I could have some things in my room. Problem is now there's food all the time, and somehow it's worse than when I was at home with everyone else there and my own food-free room and everything. I've been binging and gaining weight, and I thought I was just settling in, but it's been a week now and nothing has changed so I'm scared it's going to be more permanant.I'm scared that binging is killing me. I'm not as overfull as I used to be but it's still bad, plus I know this kind of food is bad for you in the long run. I had an arrythmia associated with low weight/stress that has been persistent -- I checked it with the doctor last year and he says it's probably still just stress. Still it's worse when I've been binging, and I know it's probably just that that's when I'm stressed out, but regardless I hate that correlation. I have a single room, and I'm afraid that if something went wrong with my heart no one would be there to notice or help me.I know I'll probably get over the binging when classes really get going and that the heart arrythmia is normal, but I'm still in a kind of adjusting limbo and it's scary. I'm afraid of never losing the weight (frehsman 15!) and I'm afraid of dying. I'm such a slob when I'm binging, and I hate hate hate the image of me all alone in my messy dorm room stuffing myself overfull of crap.I just wanted somewhere to write this, I guess. Thanks for your virtual listening :)",recoveryj,"Wed,08/26/2020-7:46am","Good for you for taking steps to make sure you have food available when you need it! That’s a big step in recovery. I’m sorry you’re finding that your stress is driving you to binge right now. I imagine you’re right in that it will help once classes get started, but maybe it would be helpful to seek out a therapist who specializes in EDs right now. That way, you can get on top of things before anything worse happens. Additionally, I would try to find an ED dietician to help you. They can even help you navigate the school’s meal plan in a way that isn’t so overwhelming. You mentioned that you had heart issues due to low weight, was that caused by an ED? It may be helpful to find the dietician to make sure you are getting what you need in order to maintain a healthy weight. Additionally, sometimes when we are restricting, the body takes over and causes us to binge. Maybe really looking into whether or not you are meeting your body’s needs will help you figure out why these binges are occurring.
Finally, don’t fall for the “freshman 15” myth. The truth is, our bodies are growing and changing constantly. I know it’s hard, especially when EDs make us feel like we have to be in control, but try to allow your body to exist as it is. There’s nothing wrong with fluctuations. It could be your body is still trying to find a good set point since ED. Allow yourself to be curious and explore your body’s needs and abilities. You are deserving of nourishment. Always.

256,08/21/2020,Isitwrong?,Miggi,Every week I like to reward myself with one 'cheat' or 'bad' food. This week a did a whole pint of ice cream. Or a big tub of a certain creamy dessert. Now i'm wondering if that's bad. Is eating a whole pint bad? Do people normally do this?,girlwhenquiet,"Sat,08/22/2020-2:12am","Personally, I feel like it depends on the motivation. Since you're calling it a cheat day, it kind of concerns me because it feels like you might be really restricting other days/at least have that mindset towards other days? However, we all know that eating a whole pint of ice cream every day in most cases would be unhealthy, so don't get me wrong. I think that only doing it once a week or so is probably smart. In general, I think there are a lot of non-disordered people who do occasionally eat a whole pint of ice cream as a comfort after a hard week or in joy after a successful event or even as a mindful treat. However, if you're eating past fullness (such as a compulsion) or only allowing yourself to indulge in desserts like this after you have been sticking to a certain eating pattern the rest of the weak, I think that might be something to bring up with your doctor/team. Inherently food isn't wrong to eat and neither is a certain amount of it (unless you're harming yourself in either direction). ""Normal""/non-disordered people don't set ""food rules"" about when and what they can eat, unless they are a proper dietary restriction such as with a diabetic or celiac patient. The good news is that you're able to recognize your behaviors might be slightly hindering you're recovery, and you have the opportunity to reach out to your support system. Sending you love and strength.",marty2020,"Sat,08/22/2020-8:51am","I’m sorry to hear that you’re concerned about your food choices, but I’m glad that you’re reaching out to the forums for support. It’s easy to stress over eating food that we’ve personally moralized as “good” or “bad,” and it can be really distressing sometimes. When ruminating over eating specific types of foods, I try to remember that what’s “normal” for someone else may not exactly be “normal” for me; everyone is different and nutritional needs differ amongst every individual. Seeking out the help of a nutritionist could also help find an optimal plan for your exact dietary requirements.

257,08/20/2020,Toexerciseornottoexercise?,fightingbee,"I  started eating enough and regularly again about 1,5 months ago, but have never really stopped exercising. I'm still on relatively small portions and a supplemental drink but despite the exercise, I'm gaining weight quite rapidly as my metabolism is (probably) still suppressed. For anyone who knows a thing or two about metabolism when underweight: Will exercise aid in speeding it up or should I stop all exercise besides walking? Will my body keep saving everything it gets as long as I'm exercising out of fear it might not be enough food coming in to compensate for the exercise? Can anyone help me? I'm really trying to speed up my metabolism, so that I won't gain forever on the small portions and so that my treatment team will one day allow me to have snacks in between meals, as I'm really craving sweets right now but we only get them once the weight gain plateaus :(Also, I feel like whenever I stop exercising for a day or two, I retain more water in my ankles than on days when I exercise or move a lot. It really confuses me what to do and I don't know if some of the weight gain can be water weight, even when the edema is not visible in my legs or face?Edit: and how long does it take until metabolism starts speeding up again? I mean, I have already gained quite a bit, shouldn't it have sped up already?",recoveryj,"Thu,08/20/2020-10:32am","First off, I want to congratulate you on the steps you’ve taken in recovery. You have come such a long way from what it sounds like!
I definitely understand the issues around exercise. Compulsive exercise has been one of my behaviors. It’s such a double-edged sword because there are benefits; like you with the edema and me with my chronic pain. It can be so difficult to find a balance. I would highly encourage you to talk to your team about your concerns. I know for me, it took a total reset of the system (i.e. meal plan with little to no exercise) for my body to regulate. And even then it took a while. Not only is it in panic because of the fear of not getting enough again, but there is so much healing to be done from the damage caused by restriction. That takes a ton of energy that we don’t account for since it’s all below the surface. It could be that right now, your body just needs to rest and heal. I get that uncomfortableness of not exercising (not to mention water retention!) but doing what your body needs to heal will help you get through this part of recovery and onto a place where you feel strong and your body is able to accommodate more movement again.
I’m sorry this has been difficult; I definitely understand. Know that you are not alone, and that nothing lasts forever. Ask your team their thoughts about exercise. Maybe they’ll be able to help you find some movement such as yoga or something that can help with the edema without overloading your body. They are here to help you through this and support you. And we are here too.
Take care,

258,08/18/2020,Cannotstopcomparingtoothers,shaoyxx,"Hello, I need some advice on how to stop comparing myself to people around me and stop feeling guilty. So I want to do a brief background context. I moved to America when I was 13 and I have been living with my aunt and uncle for almost 4 years now. My aunt is a very strict person so she actually helped me restore my weight. However, my aunt naturally has a very slim body and she does not eat much every day. She eats very little for her breakfast and only eats some food groups for lunch. And our family usually has a bigger dinner. She does yoga for a while every day and exercises with me and my uncle for a little longer. I would say I eat way more than her and definitely do not exercise as much as she does. She always tells me I should not compare to her because she is much older (She is 50) and her body does not need that much food. But still, I could not stop feeling guilty and wanting to compare with her because she is so skinny and she eats so little. Especially now under quarantine, I have to stay with her all the time and I just feel so bad and guilty every day. Can anyone give me some advice on what I should do? Many thanks!",Tryingtoheal,"Wed,08/19/2020-1:36pm",she struggles with an eating disorder or disordered eating or doesn't want to worry you.   I can relate to comparing my body to others in the past.

Please keep us posted.,yoyokay,"Thu,08/20/2020-12:44pm","I guess my advice is just to remind yourself that we do not have to be at the same place as anyone else. We are allowed to be different sizes, eat different amounts, and do different levels of physical activity. There will always be people on both sides of you for all of these things. I know it doesn't help much, but I think you just need to practice retraining your mindset, which takes some time and effort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
259,08/15/2020,Mentalhungeroremotionaleating,annewwww,"Dear friends, I hope everyone is well. I have been suffering form exercise bulimia for five years now. Throughout the years, to fix my problem, I always tried to mentally control my urge to binge -- and actually became really good at it. Little did I know that the root cause of my problem was my obsession with exercise, poor body image, and fear for food. I entered the recovery process about 1 month ago, and I feel a lot of freedom from food already. However, I definitely still have a lot of anxieties and questions. One of which is I don't know if I experience ""mental hunger"" or if I'm just eating due to boredom. I would really love to hear people's thoughts on mental hunger. Thanks!",SmashThePatriarchy,"Mon,08/17/2020-8:56pm","Hi Annewwww! I think it's a process to relearn how to really listen to your body for hunger cues. For me, just being mindful about eating without any judgement whatsoever was the key. It just takes time for everything to click together - listening to your body, learning what your hunger cues are, learning what different hungers ""feel"" like... for me, it was a lot of trial and error, and being gentle with myself. People eat for all kinds of reasons, and for me actually now that I think about it, it was the combination of listening to my body and TRUSTING MYSELF to listen to my body that was the key. Does that make sense? Congrats on entering recovery! Freedom from food is a beautiful feeling!! <3, STP",recoveryj,"Tue,08/18/2020-7:26am","Just to add to that, it sometimes takes a while for hunger cues to regulate in eating disorders. Know that this is normal and you are not alone. The most important aspect is making sure you’re honoring your body and getting the nutrition you need. Even cravings can tell us something that we may need or be lacking.
Also, know that emotional/mental hunger is real too, ED or not. To some, food is a comfort. And that is okay. Allow yourself to honor your needs. I know it’s terrifying, but the more you nourish yourself and the more you tune in and listen, the easier it gets. And once your body trusts you to attend to its needs, the hunger cues will regulate too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m working with a dietician and a therapist as well as have a support system of friends and family by my side, but something I can’t seem to get a diagnosis on yet are all of my digestive issues.
I’m constantly uncomfortable, all the time. Every food I eat makes me gassy, bloated, uncomfortable, and usually get acid reflux.

I have been successfully eating three meals and two snacks a day to try and stop losing weight, but a big challenge for me is still in the discomfort I feel when I have to eat. I hate eating at work because I don't like feeling like people can see me eat, I just feel like a slob and feel like I want to hide. Another issue is the physical sensation of fullness. I never eat very large meals for lunch, but I still get very uncomfortable feeling the pressure of food being in my stomach. Tips or coping strategies to deal with being more comfortable with the process of eating?",weouthere,"Tue,08/04/2020-7:21pm","I’ve felt the same way for years, you’re not alone. I don’t have much to offer in advice, just to hang in there and keep eating as normally as possible. It does get easier eventually, you just have to keep going. Normalcy will come with persistence. Best of luck! I believe in you!!!",yoyokay,"Mon,08/10/2020-12:20pm","I appreciate your reply to my post, and I am going to try to stick with regular eating, though I am nervous because I think I still need to raise my calorie intake.",jess64,"Wed,08/05/2020-7:55pm","Hi yoyokay,
Sorry you have been struggling with this for so long – but you definitely are not alone. I think it is a super common anxiety for people even without an ED. There is so much judgment around food and eating so I definitely understand how you feel. I think the best advice is what weouthere said, to just try and keep eating normally! Hopefully, it will soon be so natural you forget that people are there. It definitely also helps to remember; people often are not truly looking. As much as it seems like they are, they are too wrapped up in their own stuff. Sending love.",Miggi,"Thu,08/06/2020-11:27pm","I understand, i still have a big issue with people seeing me eating. I'm not sure what to tell you, I put in earbuds and listen to music or watch something so that I can distract myself and other people won't bother you because your watching something.

270,08/02/2020,Excuseforexcercising,Miggi,"I have been doing exercise videos in my room, but my family doesn't know. I am a healthy weight now, but my family still urges me to eat more and exercise less. My older brother loves to come into my room and talk to me often, but usually when i'm exercising. I can't tell him what i'm doing because he would tell my family and I wouldn't be able to exercise anymore. But he is feeling neglected when he knocks on the door and I don't let him in because i'm exercising, he thinks i'm avoiding him. What do I say i'm doing so that he feels better?",Blue44,"Mon,08/03/2020-7:47am",I can relate to what you are saying about the exercise. I don’t really have any advice for you. I exercise when my family doesn’t know. My family would probably be upset if they knew that I am exercising. I don’t like keeping the exercise a secret. I hope that you can find some support by knowing that you aren’t alone.,recoveryj,"Mon,08/03/2020-10:13am","Have you ever thought that maybe your family doesn’t want you exercising for a reason? I know that one of the key aspects of EDs is exercising in secrecy. Your family cares about you so much. They just want you to be well and to be able to spend time with you as you truly are.
Maybe this would be a good time to really give some thought to your motivation to exercise. It is often a very triggering thing for EDs. Right now, it sounds like ED is telling you to exercise and isolate yourself from those who love you. Exercise shouldn’t be compulsive; it also shouldn’t be a way of controlling or punishing your body. Exercise is best when it is a way of getting in touch with your body and expressing yourself through healthy movement. That paired with nourishing your needs and honoring your body are the keys to recovery.
I would highly recommend talking to your therapist about this. I know I struggle a lot with compulsive exercise, and it makes maintaining recovery really difficult sometimes. It’s important to explore the reasons you feel you “need” to exercise and tease out what’s really behind those motivations.
I wish you all the best in breaking this habit. And I hope you can spend more time with your brother
Julesthefox",yoyokay,"Mon,08/03/2020-7:04pm","Completely agree with julesthefox. I would like to add that I know the compulsive drive to exercise and desire to move to burn off calories is really hard to fight, but as julesthefox suggested, your family has your best interests at heart. One thing I would suggest is to first, tell your family how hard it has been for you to fight these urges, and then ask them to participate in low-impact movement activities with you. This could be a good middle ground to keeping any compulsive desires in check and moving your body in a healthy way, instead of pushing it to the extremes. Examples might be going on walks or mild hikes with family, doing yoga or stretches, swimming, dancing, or anything enjoyable that your doctor has medically cleared you for. (Talk to a doctor for their advice!).",_admin_moderator,"Mon,08/03/2020-8:49pm",Hi yoyokay - your post had to be edited to comply with our Community Guidelines.

I’m trying to find another job in the state I live in, but it looks like I may need to move out of state again. I just bought a custom built home a month ago here, and only moved in 3 weeks ago. I am beside myself again tonight. I have been without ED behaviors for 5 years and have only rarely had ED thoughts during that time. But in the past few days I have been inching closer and closer to behaviors and am having thoughts almost constantly because my anxiety is so high. I’ve been out of therapy for 4 years.

If anxiety is triggering your ED thoughts, why not to schedule a few sessions with your therapist to work on it? In that way, you could feel better and avoid any type of ED slip.In my personal case, mindfulness helps a lot. There are a lot of 15-20 minutes mindfulness-guided sessions in the web that you can take.When I am too anxious, sometimes I cry because I can not stand still and focus. But little by little, I start letting my anxiety go. Cheers

277,07/25/2020,"Recovery,Relationships,dishonesty",Jascat0409,"I feel like this post could go under either ‘maintaining’ or ‘working toward’ recovery, but nonetheless I need some insight. I’m sure most of you here have had a problem with lying in your relationships- mostly because ED can make you feel ashamed, unloveable, etc.. Even after going to res and maintaining recovery, I have this problem with being honest about how I’m REALLY doing, or being honest about throwing up. I mean, the only person I’m really lying to is myself. I’ve come to the conclusion that I lie because it tricks my mind into believing that I’m okay- that I’m normal...you know, all of those things that people without eating disorders can do. My boyfriend has basically given me the easiest ultimatum, even though we’re both against ultimatums, and it is simply to stop lying. Honest is so important and it’s something I haven’t given him regarding my ED. After 2 1/2 years, I still feel so scared to tell him that I’ve thrown up. Of all the things- I just can’t be honest about it- and I want to SO BAD. I have this conditioned response to deny, deny, deny. It’s obviously a result of my eating disorder, but I’m so done with it. Why can’t I just own up to it? Agh. I don’t want to end things, but I also know that it’s not fair to him to keep lying. He’s told me he’s not going to ever leave me because of ED, but that my dishonesty is hurting him and he can’t keep going on like this.",sadieelizabeth7,"Wed,07/29/2020-1:27pm","Hi Jascat0409, I’m sorry you’re struggling with this, I know exactly what you mean when you say you have this “conditioned response to deny, deny, deny”, that was my strategy for the longest time. While I was mostly lying to my friends at the time of my ED, I know how it hurts to know someone you care about doesn’t feel like they can fully trust you anymore. It really seems like you care about your boyfriend, and you’re right, it is the ED telling you that you should hide and be ashamed of this. So I mean an important thing also is to not be too hard on yourself, you’re going through a lot, and maybe a good start to telling him would be to talk to him about how hard it is to talk about this stuff (if you haven’t already), because shame is a HUGE part of ED, and existing in this world in general pretty much. And given the way you’ve described him, I think he’ll get it, he seems like a really supportive and understanding person. I wish I had more specific tips, but maybe if you have some kind of support like a therapist or counselor they could help too?

I have to do this because my next step was residential and my parents said no way so I could not do that. I have done well for a week now. It’s hard but I have to do it whether I like it or not which I don’t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
282,07/13/2020,Howtodealwithweightgain,racastro98,I've been in recovery for five months and I've started to notice weight gain. I've realized that this makes me very anxious and I'm starting to lose focus on why I want to recover. Do you guys have any tips on how to deal with this. I've started to revert back to some old ED behaviors and I'm scared I might relapse.,_admin_moderator,"Mon,07/13/2020-9:43pm","Hi racastro98! Welcome to the forums - we’re glad you’re here. Your post had to be edited to comply with our Community Guidelines, as details about specific disordered eating behaviors can be triggering to others. Please take a moment to review our guidelines, and please continue posting!",weouthere,"Fri,07/17/2020-8:36pm","I'd just like to say that weight gain is a normal and essential part of recovery and it happens to everyone. Gaining weight is also a normal part of life. No one stays the same weight their entire life. You are still deserving of food and worthy of love. Remind yourself that every day, and seriously, stop weighing yourself. Ditching the scale was the best thing for my recovery, period.",sadieelizabeth7,"Sat,07/18/2020-1:36pm","I totally agree with weouthere on this one! Ditching the scale was soo important for my recovery (I even ask not to see it at the doctor's office) because thinking about my body in that context never made me feel good (ever). Nevertheless, I know weight gain can still be noticeable even when you don't weigh yourself, and that is especially tricky I think. The most important thing that worked for me is every time I'd notice myself being critical about my own size/shape I'd challenge those negative thoughts and try to address the way my body looks as a neutral fact. Even if I still don't feel very good about it, I know *attempting* to change it is only going to hurt me, mentally and physically. Accepting this is something I'm even still working on. Wishing you the best in your recovery, we're here for you.",Flo:positivityf...,"Sat,07/25/2020-6:04am","Hi racastro9, I just wanna say well done on opening up about your anxiety on weight gain because I know it can be hard to be honest about our feeling sometimes so its amazing that you are being honest and seeking support for your feelings (congratulate yourself on that!) also remember that a key part of EDs is distortion of reality and so you will need to challenge ideas that you have held in order to fully recover, part of that is realising that weight gain is a positive step in recovery and not something you should feel anxious about. Part of your brain is still fearing gaining weight but remember that those thoughts are just aspects of an ED and will try to hold back your recovery, try to remind yourself that gaining weight is a really positive step in your recovery and restoring health to your body. At first it might feel like you are trying to tell yourself things that deep down you do not believe, but your brain will eventually adapt to your new way of thinking and you will feel really good about what you have achieved.  Seeing your body change can cause worry but you need to focus of the ultimate aim of having a healthy body, gaining weight means that your body is getting increased minerals and vitamins that will lead to increased energy, better mind ability, healthier skin and hair and lots of other health benefits. Once you notice the increase in energy and other things it will reaffirm your positive steps but you also need to combat the anxiety to do with adding weight by reminding yourself that it is essential for your recovery. Once you are a healthy weight, the increased energy levels from added nutrition can help you focus on new activities and achieve other goals in your life which is really exciting, so praise your progress and look forward to the positive benefits that will follow, you are doing really well but often we forget to acknowledge and give ourself praise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
283,07/20/2020,ShouldItelltheworldaboutmyED?,barewithme,"Hi All,Just hoping someone could help me with this decision.I had an ED which led me to restrict my food for 10 years. 2 years ago when I started eating meals I told a friend of mine, she was nice about it but then she's not mentioned it ever again, I also told my sister and she's never spoken to me about it since also. It feels like people act weirdly around the subject.I have recently been writing a blog which I am thinking of including my story of my ED in, but I am apprehensive of telling everyone and wondering whether or not to disclose my identity.A part of me wants to put it out there as I know I shouldn't care what people think, but I don't want others to treat me differently or say if I met a guy and they knew I had an eating disorder and read the details of my journey, whether that would put them off?Has anyone has the experience of telling all their friends? and how did things change for you?I'd love to hear all your thoughts?Thank you!
x",Annet,"Tue,07/21/2020-4:24pm","I am in a similar situation. However, I have not taken any action, yet.
On the one hand, I would like to tell the world how living with an ED looks like.
On the other one, I would not like my family and friends to ""discover"" it.
If helping others is our call, I think we should go ahead. If our relatives and friends are not experiencing an ED themselves or within their family members, it is unlikely they will run into our blog, book or whatever we publish.
If they find it out, most likely they will be compassionate and will have already benefit from what we wrote.
Just some thoughts. Do what your heart ask you to do.Cheers
Annet",2Healthy4me,"Tue,07/21/2020-9:43pm","Some people only heard of others having an ED. They justified their understanding of this problem with, ""Well it will never happen 2 me because I'm not mentally ill."" ED's do come in shades of grey, as well as extreme emaciation and bulimia. I am not sure how your health was during the time that u shared this personal secret w/ your friends or family but some people drop the subject when dealing with a topic involving the listener being responsible to pass the info on to an adult in charge or a someone else. In the case of 1 revealing their ED, this can be a difficult secret to understand and pursue as non trained people who know you as an image of something else. Everyone deals w/ being flooded with a new piece of personal info in different ways.
 Good luck in your continuing recovery here on NEDA.",sadieelizabeth7,"Wed,07/22/2020-1:34pm","Hey, I think as long as you're comfortable, sharing your story is a great idea. I've only told a few people outside of my immediate family about the ED I struggled with, including 1 close friend and my girlfriend, and they've both been really understanding and supportive. Taking control of your story can be so so empowering and I think sharing it in a written, put together way gives you a great opportunity to vent and tell your story the way you want it to be known. This as opposed to it slipping out in some kind of off-handed way where it might get misconstrued or misinterpreted by someone you care about, which is not ideal. On the other hand, you still might get some ignorant or somewhat triggering questions (I know I have, even from well-intentioned people) so as long as you're prepared for that I think it could be a good chance to provide some more perspective onto these things that are so misunderstood by the general public :) Best of luck! -Elizabeth",yoyokay,"Fri,07/24/2020-12:06pm","I have always tried to be pretty open about my mental health struggles, and I often include themes of my mental health in a lot of my artwork. People can surprise you with their understanding and may even feel relieved enough to share their own story. Someone just revealed to me that they also had a history of ed and were so compassionate and kind in wishing me support. I think if everyone made an effort to talk about these things a little more often, there would be a lot less shame surrounding these topics. I hope you all are doing well and encourage you to at least ask for support from a loved one, if not making a more public statement (of course you are still 100% entitled to your privacy and comfort!)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

287,07/19/2020,Feelingquitedissapointed,Annet,"Hi everyone, I recently had an appointment with my therapist and at the end of the session she said: ""When should I see you again? Within 3 weeks? Should we take a break? I felt like if she was trying to say ""I am done with you. This is the best I can help you be"". After the session, I felt pretty dissapointed like if full remediation for me was not possible. I am really reluctant to be just functional and still have an eating disorder. I have lived like that for years and it has been torturing. I want to achieve full recovery. I know I have improved a lot since I started to work with her (2 years ago). She was a good fit for me and I have progressed as ever. But now, her comment made me feel like I have gone a long way and I am at the best I could be. What should I do? I often doubt about ""full recovery"" being possible. I often dream of it but feel it as an impossible thing for me. However, I still want it. On the other hand, I feel quite ashamed of discussing the reaction I had to my therapist's comment with her.

289,07/17/2020,Feelingguilty,Annet,"Hi All,I had a healthy breakfast but I feel too bad with myself. Somehow, I had to start with my work meetings earlier and when I ate, I was not hungry.Eating when not hungry causes me A LOT of distress. I do not want to feel full all day or to continue feeling guilty just for fueling my body.Any ideas as of how to deal with a situation like this?
How can I tolerate to eat when I am not hungry if I know I will not have time to do it later?Annet",weouthere,"Fri,07/17/2020-8:31pm","Sometimes with EDs, our hunger cues take a while to come back fully. This can make it really hard to tell if we're hungry, thirsty, tired, sad, or bored. Something that helped me in the beginning was setting a goal that is realistic and achievable for each day/week. Something like ""I am going to eat 3 meals today"", or ""I am going to eat lunch no matter what this week"". Eating gets easier over time, and hunger cues will start to come back once you eat regularly.Hope that helps! Good luck!!",Annet,"Sun,07/19/2020-2:30pm","Thanks a lot for sharing your experience. Actually, I can eat my 3 meals with no issues but I am kind of a disaster with regards to snacks. Sometimes I have them, sometimes I don't.

I have been trying but they are still not there. But of course, I have not been 100% consistent...Hugs
Annet",weouthere,"Sun,07/19/2020-10:08pm","Hi Annet! In my experience, it took time, consistency, and patience to be able to tell when my body needs nourishment. Snacks are tricky and still confuse me sometimes too. Focus on really trying to listen to your body. If you think you may be ready for a snack, take a deep breath and really think about what you’re in the mood for. Do you want something lighter or are you ready for a full meal? It takes practice but I know you can do it. Keep going and trust the process!!",recoveryj,"Sat,07/18/2020-7:37am","I definitely resonate with this. For me, my hunger cues were thrown way off by ED. I made a really strict schedule for myself to make sure I stay on track with meals. It nearly sent me into panic attacks if I had to adjust that for any reason - I even scheduled therapy appointments around it!
I think it’s absolute incredible that you were able to nourish yourself even if you didn’t feel like it. That shows amazing recovery work. You knew you’d need it, so you stood up to ED and got what you needed. I’m still struggling with that.
One of the things I try to do is remind myself that every day is different. Each day isn’t going to look the same as the last. What matters is that I’m able to get what I need and accomplish what I want to do, even if it’s not on a strict schedule.
The one constant in life is that it’s always changing. You showed amazing adaptability and responsibility. I hope you’re feeling better, because you truly are amazing.",Annet,"Sat,07/18/2020-7:25pm","I am feeling better. At least, I do not feel guilty about that breakfast, anymore.
However, today, I had a late breakfast and had to have lunch with my family when not completely hungry. I am challenging my ED constantly but to be honest, sometimes I feel I just can not tolerate my own challenges!I am so unflexible! I wished I was a little bit more flexible...especially around food, food times and work out sessions.It is an interesting thing that you were able to schedule therapy appointments close to your meal times. I would love to be able to have something like that when I have to eat and I am not hungry. The thoughts that invade me when that happens is vomiting...skipping the next meal...feeling full forever... Unfortunately, my therapist is not available around my meal times.Maybe I can just try to eat a snack in front of her... when for sure I will not be hungry and see what happens...Cheers with your recovery.

I understand the complexity of all of this and I also understand where they are coming from. In several cases, the first thing doctors want to do is to hospitalize you.
But being honest to yourself, do you think you really need residential at this moment or do you think you are strong enough to commit to an outpatient recovery?
Whatever the answer is please fight for it. Do it for you and not to please anyone else.
If as of now, you can not afford any more intense treatment, that is okay. Later, you will have the opportunity to pay for your bills and also afford the treatment you need/deserve.If the current decision is to have dinner with your parents, be 100% compliant with it. Put all your effort to eat and make things happen. Take one day at a time and listen to your treatment team. I am sure they will support you with your decision but will also give you more outpatient challenges. Take them. Keep doing your best.At some point, my treatment team said I needed to be inpatient because I was very bad. I really wanted it but my parents could not afford it. They got me the best outpatient help they could and eventually I got out of the risk zone. But I had to do my best with the resources that were available to me at the moment.Do your best. Hugs
Annet",hermione3,"Fri,07/17/2020-7:57am",I have to get out of the risk zone myself I probably do need residential it just is not possible at this point.

I have a good outpatient team I just have to utilize them.,alwaysthinking,"Fri,07/17/2020-3:09am","Hi Hermione. If I remember correctly, don't you kind of have a difficult relationship with your parents in the first place? Like, aren't they kind of emotionally abusive? It sounds like they're almost using their financial status to have yet another hold over you. If you feel that you truly need residential and your team truly feels you need residential, there has got to be a way to do it. Especially if it ends up being medically necessary. I understand the quandary with needing to be able to pay bills, especially the rent for your apartment, because that is essential. I know it is a long shot, and it still might be a viable option, but have you tried to  apply for financial aid ahead of time? I know that there are programs where are some places will even give you grants where are you are able to go there at no cost or very little. It's just a matter of looking into every angle and seeing what truly is possible. I personally don't know how you go about doing this I have just simply heard it from others. But I am sure your team would know more. I really do feel for you, because I know what it's like to have parents who act like you are helpless and under their control and at the same time expect you to take control. It doesn't make sense, and it makes it even harder to get better. I wish you the best.",hermione3,"Fri,07/17/2020-7:53am",Thanks for the support it’s  not the cost of the program it’s outside bills and yes I do have a complicated relationship with my parents.

I did well yesterday I have to just keep it up which won’t be easy but I just need to residential is like not an option with my parents and unfortunately I need them involved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
292,07/16/2020,Hiagain.Couldusesomesupport.,alwaysthinking,"So for those who remember me, it's obviously been a while. I've actually been doing pretty well with maintaining recovery now. Except I've had a gigantic slam in my life that I can't get into detail on this site because it would be way too triggering. Let's just say it is majorly traumatic beyond belief. And it is really affecting my eating and my life. Some days I just don't feel like eating anything at all. Some days I just eat whatever sounds good. I never binge, but I might have a day where I only eat sweets or no fruits and vegetables or something like that because I just don't care. Basically, I'm in survival mode and I'm doing anything I can just to keep myself safe in my head because I am not safe physically and literally. Let's just say even the detective on my case can't figure out how to keep me safe. That's all I can get into to explain what's going on. To add to that, I have bed bugs in my apartment that just won't go away. And my life just keeps getting more and more complicated.

My psychologist has suggested I try and eat at least three meals a day with snacks in between, but I don’t think I have eaten that much food in over 6 years! I’m really anxious and nervous about doing this. Does anybody have any tips about increasing their food intake and keeping it down without destructive behaviour?

My wording probably wasn’t the best! More about what others did to keep their mind off of food to keep on track. Thanks.,recoveryj,"Thu,07/16/2020-7:56pm","One of the best ways is to develop a meal plan with a dietician that specializes in EDs. Starting out recovery can be super anxiety-inducing. Congratulations on taking that first step! That is huge. You are so strong to be seeking help and asking for advice to make sure you stay on the right path. You are amazing. Seriously. It is hard work.
It’s also been really helpful for me to plan activities for after meals; something you enjoy like music, reading, puzzles, or something. Some hobby. Maybe play with your pets or call a friend! That usually helps get the idea of food out of your mind enough so it doesn’t feel as bad. After a while though, it does get better. Just focus on what can usually bring you out of anxiety; maybe even a favorite tv show can help! Follow the plan, and then don’t worry about it any more than that, I guess is what I’m saying. You got this.  <3",Annet,"Thu,07/16/2020-8:40pm","I started little by little. 3 meals were mandatory but first, I started with one snack and then with the other. At first, it was really hard. I could only eat a bite of them. But later, my body started asking me for food at the snack times! Eventually, I was being compliant with my 2 snacks.  It is incredible how smart our body is. So, I would say, do not panic! Work with a Dietician and your therapist. They will be able to guide you. But first, you need to try what they asked you for. Once you tell them how you felt and how things went, they will help you with the next steps. They will also tell you how to cope with the anxiety, stress and all the things eating brings to us.Cheers

294,07/15/2020,Relapsing?,kaimore99,"Hey all,I’m new here and I’ve really wanted to find some support for going on-and-off through my eating disorder recovery. When I was 17, I was diagnosed with bulimia, but my emotional and eating symptoms were more like anorexia, but my doctor didn’t diagnose me with it because I wasn’t below the normal weight for my age and height. Throughout the past 3 years, I’ve had relapses and recoveries, I am now 20 and I think I might be relapsing again, but I don’t know. I’ve started intermittent fasting and I think that’s starting to trigger the restrictive behaviours, but I don’t want to stop because I just want to look the way I used to when I was going through the most severe part of my eating disorder. I’ve never been hospitalized or had a real treatment recovery plan, I kinda just took it on myself throughout the years, with it getting better and then relapsing again. I just started feeling like this yesterday and it’s scary and I don’t wanna tell anybody. I live with my partner currently and I don’t want to tell him because I feel like I want to hide it which I know isn’t right, but I don’t want anybody being concerned for me or trying to get me to eat or stop fasting. I just don’t know if that sounds like a relapse or not, but I just wanted some support.",jess64,"Wed,07/15/2020-7:21pm","Hi kaimore99, Sorry to hear you are having a rough time.

I hope you find something that works for you, and can get some help in your relapse. Sending love and hugs.",recoveryj,"Wed,07/15/2020-9:46pm","I would highly encourage you to stop dieting. Not only do diets never work (there's a ton of scientific evidence and research backing that up), but they are huge triggers for EDs and relapse. The fear you're experiencing about stopping definitely supports that as well.
Often times, it's the habits that we are most afraid of giving up that are hurting us and holding us back. I know it's terrifying, but maybe it would be a good time to seek a therapist who specializes in EDs. There's so much more to it than food and weight. A therapist will help you confront what's underneath the fears and behaviors so you can form a more solid base for recovery.
A hard truth for a lot of us to deal with is having to let go of the body we had before and/or during ED. It's hard to recognize while in the disorder how much bodies change over time, because we are controlling them and keeping them sick. But the truth is, everyone's body changes, ED or not. Your body is in a different place now. And I'm sure it still has a lot of healing to do due to the time spent in ED. If you're still restricting/dieting, you're not allowing it to do that most essential work of restoration. The longer you wait, the more damage is done.
You deserve so much more. You deserve to feel at home in your body. You deserve a body you can work with, rather than against. You deserve to have a healthy relationship with food and a plan that allows you to function at your highest capacity.
It shows how much you've worked on recovery that you're able to recognize signs of relapse. I'm so glad you reached out and posted on the forum. That takes a lot of strength. You are worthy of the help you need to heal. If you are unsure of therapists in your area, you can call NEDA and they can help.
Bodies change. It's terrifying, but it doesn't mean they are any less. You are not less because of your body. In fact, your body is part of you; part of you that is a strong survivor and warrior. Part of what makes you beautiful. And there's nothing that will ever change that.
Please see if you can seek some help. It's always good to start early. You deserve it. You are worth it.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,07/16/2020-2:16pm",Welcome to the forums!

295,07/10/2020,Itwasquietformeandnowitisn't,stephanie90,"It was quiet for me. Not loud, not visible. It was my secret that I was both ashamed and proud of. It felt wrong but it was a wrong I could control. Eating disorders and body dysmorphia are about so much more than food. I remember in 2nd grade a boy called me fat. He said it in a way that made it an insult. I went to the bathroom and cried. Fat is not an insult, but our culture loudly disagrees. It’s in the magazines and celebrities that we celebrate. It’s in the advertisements we consume. I had a problem with my body and food every single day after 2nd grade. It was quiet for me. No one knew just how much I thought about it. I wish I could go back in time and tell someone. Maybe they would’ve helped me stop form a mental habit that was as part of my routine as getting dressed. I remember my mom took photos of me in 3rd grade. I wanted to delete them the second I saw them because of how I looked. I didn’t tell her. It was quiet for me. I wish I had spoken up. It was 4th grade when I put my hands in front of my stomach when I was in a bathing suit so people couldn’t see my stomach. It was quiet for me. It was in 5th grade when I started to plan out how I would eat for the day so as to minimize how many calories I ate. 6th grade is when it got bad. I went to a new school and was not able to make friends. I needed control. It was skipping breakfast, eating something small at lunch that never got finished, and saying I wasn’t hungry or moving my food around at dinner. I made sure it was quiet. I didn’t want anyone to know. It was transferring to a new school thinking that I could put the past behind me. I became too hungry to not eat. So it became going to the solo bathroom that not many people passed to hear my behaviors. It was quiet for me. I started turning towards exercise to counter my body issues instead. It was a logical and safe transition for me then. It was thinking I was done with purging, but periodically doing it every year whenever my thoughts about my body get bad. It was quiet for me. It was never feeling comfortable in tight clothing or showing my stomach. It was comparing myself to others. It was not talking about it. It was quiet for me. I wish I had a distinct moment where it became less quiet for me. It took me years. It took slowly opening up. It took finally taking the time to process what I had been doing since I was 7. It was meeting with a dietitian and not being able to control the tears coming out of my eyes when I finally said out loud that I had an eating disorder when I was 11. It was finally realizing how much I needed a hug and someone to talk to back then. It was showing love to my inner child. It was going to therapy and finally putting a spotlight on my eating disorder. It couldn’t hide. It isn't quiet for me anymore. I know that it is still quiet for so many other girls and boys. It’s vulnerable and terrifying to talk about. Don’t rush, but know, it doesn’t have to be quiet for you either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She is not aware of my ED, only my parents know, and when I see her engage in dieting behaviors I just feel like a failure for not 'competing' with her and not engaging in them, and since Im not engaging in them I am 'unhealthy'. Any advice for coping with diet talk and habits that you cannot avoid?

When I was at my worst I would constantly get chest pains and such, yet since I've been eating normally they have subsided, yet if I dont eat for a longer period of time I start to get out of breath and chest discomforts/throbs, is there a reason as to why this is happening?

I think one of the biggest traps ED can get us in is comparison/competition. It’s so hard to snap out of that, especially when it feels like society is against us!
One of the things I try to focus on is remembering what is true - every body has different needs. Not engaging in ED/diet behaviors shows your amazing self-awareness and ability to be responsible for yourself and your needs. The “diet culture” we see in society itself is a sickness. It is not designed with the goals of health and well-being. It’s not even focused on weight. All the diet plans and products that exist are designed to keep people trapped in the cycle so they can make money. Period. That’s all there is too it. They’re designed to take advantage of people and take their money.
Something I learned in recovery that I had never considered is that THIN IS NOT THE DEFAULT. Again and again we see images of thin/toned people in the media. But the truth is, not only do those images consist of a very select few, the majority of them aren’t even real! They’ve been enhanced and retouched to give us the idea that we are lesser. It brought up a lot of feelings of shame in me recognizing my own biases in regards to weight. Some bodies are healthier at higher weights, some put on more muscle, etc. And that is NORMAL. Normal is not what we see in the media. And it never was.
Through research, I’ve even learned that BMI wasn’t even developed by a medical professional. It’s not based on health. It was developed by a mathematician who used a very select population. BMI is based on numbers and eugenics. It doesn’t indicate health either. The entire system in this society is biased and extremely unsupportive for actual health.
All that to say, you should be so proud to not be a victim of that anymore. And congratulations on the amazing steps you are taking in recovery. You have such strength. I hope your sister can see that in you and realize that there is a better, healthier, happier way to live.In regards to the chest pain; I experience that too off and on. I think it has something to do with acid reflux. Even if you haven’t had issues with that before, EDs make us vulnerable to developing digestive issues. It especially makes sense that you’ve been experiencing that when hungry as acid reflux happens when there’s acid in the stomach going up the esophagus a bit (because it’s not working on digesting food). If it gets really distressing, maybe mention it to your doctor. Otherwise, I wouldn’t worry too much. Just keep staying strong on the recovery path. You are doing amazing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Honestly, I have never been on a forum like this before, and I don't mean to sound like I have it all figured out-cause I am still dealing with this crap years after my residential.

At first I hated the term, because it means there may be no such thing as full recovery.  In thinking about it a bit, I am pretty sure I lived in mediocre recovery for 12 years.  It wasn't perfect and not without moments of doubt and restriction, but I managed to get 2 Masters Degrees, figure out my career goals, and be independent.  Then I slipped and didn't allow myself to get help and get back on track.  That slip up was about seven years ago.  I am just picking up the pieces again, and this time with heavy regrets.  I don't know the extent of the damage to my body, and I am working my way through all of the doctors right now.I am trying to emphasize that no matter what your career goals may be and how great your job is, if you are hanging on by a thread right now you are not even in 'mediocre recovery' you are still actively in the middle of your ED.  A mediocre recovery will allow you to focus on your career and have the energy to pursue relationships and friendships.I wish I had paused work and everything 7 years ago, negative consequences and all, and said that my job is getting over this ED.  I can't go back and I have get over this regret.Also, ED has no timeline.  ""Just get over it"" or ""eat a sandwich"" or ""don't eat a sandwich"" shows little understanding of the issue.

300,07/05/2020,Isfullrecoveryreallypossible?,Annet,"Hello All,I am a 40 years old who have been struggling with an eating disorder since 21 years ago.
I have had my ups and downs. I have been in treatment multiple times. I started with anorexia, then, binge eating, then bulimia, then OSFED. As of now, I have been working on recovery for 2 years but I still have some bad days. I am much better. I can not deny it. But still, once in a while I have some slips.I am wondering if within this forum there is someone who is recovered and who could tell me if her/his recovery meant to eat intuituively and really removed all eating disorder thoughts and behaviors from their lives.Sometimes I ask myself what does being recovered mean and if recovery is really possible. To be honest, I have been trying soooo hard for so many years and it is quite frustrating to be much better but never 100% eating disorder free.Does full recovery really exist?With my post I am not trying to discourage anyone on recovery.

You can do this.,recoveryj,"Mon,07/06/2020-8:53am","I guess that depends; how do you define full recovery? Because many things in society right now can be triggering for ED thoughts, even in people who have never had an eating disorder. There is so much stigma and discrimination in society that minimizes people and overemphasizes certain traits over others. Personally, I never feel like I’ll get to a point where I don’t have ED thoughts. But for me, that’s okay. Because in my recovery, I have learned the skills to confront those thoughts. I can then transform that energy to advocate against the toxic diet culture and body shaming in society. I’m addition, I know I will never get to a place where ED isn’t a part of my history. I have grown and learned so much, and to deny that is to deny a lot of my life experience. In fact, I would be concerned if I didn’t have ED thoughts every now and again because that could mean I’m not actively fighting them (it’s easy for ED thoughts to trick you and lure you into slipping again). I think the fact that you’re able to label and recognize when the ED thoughts are louder (bad days) shows incredible growth and healing. We all have good days and bad days. My view of recovery is what we do with and how we respond to the bad days. Recovery uses them to develop more skills that will allow for stronger fights against those thoughts. Recovery is the ability to hold and recognize a thought/emotion but not allow it to dictate how you live your life. Recovery is allowing yourself to express your emotions and feelings freely and openly. Recovery is taking care of yourself both on good days and on bad days. And for me, recovery is using what I have learned from fighting ED and other mental illnesses to support and advocate for others.
How do you define recovery? What does it look like for you?",Annet,"Fri,07/10/2020-11:51pm","Hi Julesthefox,To me, recovery is being able to live a life where food, exercise and my body image are in balance and do not interfere with my day-to-day life.Ideally, being recovered would mean to be able to focus on living rather than on my eating disorder. It would also mean to be free from my eating disorder thoughts. As you mentioned, our ED has accompanied us for such a long time that it is already part of our life experience. We can not take it away from there.My eating disorder has taught me a lot. But I just do not seem to accept the remaining eating disorder thoughts and slips.Of course, my life is much better now. But I always wonder if one day I will be able to have have the relationship I used to have with food before my ED started.Maybe I am just looking for ""a perfect recovery"". Maybe I am just trying to be back to ""normal"" when ""normal"" is different to everyone. But it really drives me crazy the fact that I have been fighting against this for years and the war does not seem to have an end.I do not want to be 80 and still have an eating disorder...I do not want to continue damaging my body. I want to be ED-free.",recoveryj,"Sat,07/11/2020-8:41am","One of the things I’ve been working on in therapy is dualistic thinking. That involves holding potentially conflicting thoughts and feelings and allowing them to exist. It helps take you out it black-and-white perfectionistic thinking.
In regards to recovery, one of the pitfalls I often got trapped in (and still do sometimes) is the urge to give everything up because I’m not “doing recovery perfectly”. Everyone’s recovery journey looks different. No day is going to be the same as the last. I can mess up AND I can continue to be moving forward.
About the idea of “returning to normal”; was normal ever really there? I never want to go back to where I was because there were obvious things leading up to my ED in the first place. I have so much more knowledge and self-awareness now as well as a newly emerging sense of identity - something I never had before. I think for me, I know that the ED thoughts may never go away - once there are neuropathways in the brain, it’s easier for them to re-emerge. But that’s okay. Because now I know how to fight those thoughts. I can experience a thought AND still maintain my recovery.
I understand it’s frustrating to even have those thoughts. But I think you’ll find the urges attached fade and it will be just that - a thought. We all have intrusive thoughts at times. That’s okay. That is normal.
Additionally, even though we were stuck in ED, life still continued. We can never go back to “normal” because normal is different now. Both for ourselves and the world around us. Through the cultivation of understanding, exploration, and growth, we have developed into stronger, more aware, and more resilient people.
A thought does not deny your recovery. It does not deny the hard work you’ve put in and all you’ve been through. It’s a reminder of how strong you are to be in recovery now. It’s a reminder that things in society still need to change.
To say you’ll never think about EDs again is impossible. But I do think it is possible to transform that thought into positive action and strength. You are a powerful, resilient warrior. Recovery is possible; fully, as you learn to come into yourself and love all aspects of your being",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
301,07/10/2020,exhaustionandbrainfogadvice,herzna,"After weeks of thinking (listening to your amazing podcasts and studying the lasted research articles) about recovery, I decided to take action three days ago. I am committing to active recovery NOW! Ironically, I am a med student in my final year, being so underweight that if a doctor would see the number on the scale would have to force me into inpatient treatment- but the reality is, I am on the ward for 40 hours per week, surrounded by doctors and no one ever mentions my unacceptable appearance. Now I am struggling after increasing food and reducing my walking I feel incredibly exhausted all day and feel extreme brain fog. I have 10 weeks left on the ward (of 6 years med school) and I am wondering whether it would be better to wait with recovery after these 10 weeks or even after the final exam. On the other hand, I know that I struggled for 10 years now and have always been thinking that I can start enjoying life and eating afterwards. However, I feel so exhausted and have such a hard time every morning to get up in the morning since I started recovery that I am unsure whether I can manage both: recovery and finishing med school.

Maybe you could turn that from something that isolates you into something that connects you to others, like going for walks with your dogs and taking pictures of the beautiful/interesting things around you that catch your eye (or adorable things your dogs do) then share them on instagram or by starting a blog.

305,07/03/2020,Goingtocollege,siawoodson,"Hi everyone! I hope you're doing well. I'm 18 and just graduated high school. I've been in recovery for about a year after relapsing when I was 16. I'm weight restored and was doing really well but I fell back into old habits for about a week when I didn't fit into my dress for graduation. I got back on track after graduation was over and I'm now trying to get rid of the last ED thoughts that I couldn't get rid off in the year that I've been in recovery. My problem is that although I've gotten a lot better I still don't think my body is at it's set-point and that I'll gain more. It is hard right now with summer, swimsuits, short clothes etc. to be gaining when everyone around me is going on summer diets but I'm determined to do it... but what I'm afraid of is going to college having gained a lot of weight and maybe gaining more. I'm afraid of relapsing once I get to college because the two times that my ED was bad in my life both happened after big life changes (going to middle school and then high school). I don't know how to deal with being uncomfortable around new people and usually I think I used to rely on feeling pretty (by trying to be skinny).

306,07/08/2020,CananeatingdisordercausePTSD??,Gem13,"I had a very close call with anorexia several years ago. I was at a very low weight and admitted to the hospital by my doctor against my will (they told me if it had been 1 or 2 weeks longer my heart would have given out). After being in the hospital for three months and after having been released I relapsed hard, and have slooowly gotten better on my own (not cured, but better) over time up until now. Lately, (when I am able to sleep) I have been having nightmares about the weeks leading up to my hospital stay. How I knew I was dying but felt like I couldn't do anything about it. And then waking up in the hospital in the middle of the night with the nurses around me and an alarm going off because my heart-rate would drop so slow as I slept. I have insomnia and constantly think about my heart failing. It's haunting me still. Is this PTSD?? Everything I have researched only mentions PTSD being the CAUSE of an eating disorder, not the result. I am so confused...",recoveryj,"Wed,07/08/2020-1:23pm","I actually relate to this. There are times I have flashbacks to when my ED was worse. For me, it’s not always exact moments, but it’s the feelings associated with the ED slowly destroying me and my body. It’s terrifying. And yes; EDs can cause PTSD. Because PTSD is a reaction to a trauma - EDs are traumatic. Both mentally and physically. Think about all your body went through and all the healing it’s still doing. There will be lasting effects (again, both mentally and physically). Even if we can’t always access trauma, our Bodies Keep the Score. I would highly recommend seeking out a therapist who specializes in EDs (bonus if they also do trauma work). There is so much more to EDs than what they seem. And you deserve healing.

307,07/06/2020,Isitpossibletouseadietprogramandstayrecovered?,girlwhenquiet,"There is a specific name brand diet plan (I don't want to be triggering) that I want to follow. What are everyone's thoughts on this? Is it possible to diet and/or try to lose weight once you've made significant recovery progress? (I'm significantly overweight, but I currently don't have access to a dietician, especially not one who specializes in EDs, where I live treatment options are non existent.)",Tryingtoheal,"Tue,07/07/2020-7:08am","Diet companies aren't there to make you healthy.   They profit off weight loss, which really isn't indicative of health, and don't have your best interest at heart.  I'd rather be in a bigger, HEALTHIER body, than enslaved to weight loss, being dissatisfied with my body at a smaller size,  and obsessed with trying so hard to shrink to a size I was never meant to maintain or be in to begin with.",recoveryj,"Tue,07/07/2020-8:22am","I just want to echo the thoughts of Tryingtoheal - diet programs never work. Yes, many of them show “results” in the short-term, but that is in sacrifice of your freedom, your health, and your life. The “results” don’t show how malnourished clients become, how their metabolism is hijacked, and how they end up backfiring in the long term. That is why they exist - you have to keep paying for them. You will become enslaved.
Additionally, something was brought up to me recently that really made me think - what made “skinny” something “desirable”? There are many times in history where the opposite is true! The reason the media is promoting “skinny” is because they’ve found a way to profit off it. It’s all a scam. Skinny is NOT the default! I used to think it was for my body and if only I could “get it under control” I’d be able to see that. Now I know that it is not the natural, healthy state of my body. In fact, when I am thin, that is indicative that I’m unhealthy and can’t do all the things I want to do! Every body is different, and each has a weight at which it is designed to function. Even BMI has been proven a hoax - it was designed by a MATHEMATICIAN, NOT a doctor. And it is based on the idea of eugenics. Most populations were excluded, and only a small sample made up the “average” for the calculation. Finally, in the United States, they intentionally lowered the limit of “overweight”. Why did they do this? Because then insurance companies can charge people more for services.
Long story short, diet programs are designed to entrap you in an endless cycle that hijacks your body’s natural functioning and your own health. They are based on faulty practices and measures. In recovery, we learn to reconnect with our bodies and give ourselves the nourishment we need to be well and function to the best of our ability. Don’t sacrifice that. Don’t let the greedy people behind these programs lure you in. Your body is yours; not theirs. And you have a right to be happy and healthy in it, no matter what that looks like. Because at the end of the day, we find beauty in our uniqueness. Every body is beautiful. You are beautiful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I mean it may sound silly and I definetly don't think it's a permanent solution but sometimes like you stop picking apart what you see when you...don't see it.  I don't mean to take it to a level off .. like avoiding it at all costs but just for example in the shower I used to just look at my stomach every time and cry if it looked bigger etc. but now I just keep my head up. I don't look into mirrors or windows to check my reflection when I'm out.
I don't know if this is the right way to do it but I mean it's just another way to stop body checking. Not body checking is the best thing you can do. You really don't need to know what you look like 24/7 even though ED voices may make you want to check all the time. And then sometimes when I'm in a good mindset I will look at those parts of my body and just say what I like about them. Say/think positive things about your body even if you don't necessarily believe them because if you repeat them enough you eventually do.

316,06/30/2020,CaughtEating,Miggi,"So today I got off work at 8:45 and decided to go get some food, and I was riding my bike there. I ate it, (it wasn't that healthy.) And then when I got home my family was freaking out because they didn't know where I was (It was 9:30.) and I was really embarrassed and guilty because I was late because I wanted some food, and I didn't tell them I would be late because they would have asked me why and I didn't want to say it was because of food. I'm so ashamed that I treated myself, my family was so worried and upset just because I wanted some food. I am such a failure.",sadieelizabeth7,"Wed,07/01/2020-2:09pm","Hi, Miggi, I'm sorry that you had a stressful night, I would probably feel the same way if my family was freaking about where I was (which has happened on multiple occasions). I also understand the urge not to tell them what you're eating, especially if they've been critical of your food choices in the past. It's a natural response to avoid feeling of shame and judgement, even if you're the one that's feeling that way about what you're eating. But it doesn't make you a failure to not tell them where you were, you are a human being a people make mistakes. Do you think they'd react negatively if you were to tell them that you went to eat? I hope not, because there is nothing wrong with getting food when you feel like it, in fact, doing that is probably the opposite of what ED would tell you to do, which is a good thing! I hope you're well, stay strong and we're here for you! -Elizabeth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know from my experience that bloating is very common in the beginning. Just keep going and follow your meal plan as best as you can. It definitely complicates the process and makes it more difficult, but it usually goes away once your body starts to get used to digesting again.
If you’re worried, I’d highly recommend seeking out a professional who specializes in eating disorders. They can help you along the process and make sure your needs are being met.
We have a lot of repair work to do in the recovery process. Often, the body uses bloating and inflammation as a way of targeting areas where the mending needs to be done. It’s really uncomfortable, but know that your body is healing.
Keep going; you are doing amazing <3
Again though, if this becomes an issue, definitely reach out to a physician who is familiar with EDs so you can make sure things are going okay

Something that helped me get over anxiety about meal times is to eat some of my favorite foods, and relax with a good show. For example, I love breakfast foods and the show NCIS, so for the first few months of recovery, I was most comfortable having breakfast foods. Try to relax and trust the process, and stick to the meal plan you got during treatment! It doesn’t necessarily have to be a tv show, but I find watching tv to be a good distraction when I need it. I hope your week gets better! I’m rooting for you!!",sadieelizabeth7,"Wed,06/24/2020-1:46pm","Hi Mandy, I'm sorry you had to leave your treatment program before you were ready, that sounds like it must have been hard and it's understandable that you're struggling with recovery as a result. Something I found that you might find helpful is NEDA's covid 19 resource page, which includes a video series (that I found particularly informative) and some virtual support group options. You can find it on NEDA's website if you just search ""Covid-19"" I'm pretty sure. Idk if that's the kind of support you're looking for but I know that just connecting with others that understand what struggling with an ED is like, even if it is over video chat, can be really validating and helpful.

322,06/23/2020,ShadowJustBehind,spiral462,"I've been in recovery for 7/8ish years.
I have a two year old, and gained lots of weight during the pregnancy. I tried the ""embracing the new body"" mindset, eating healthier, etc. But I can feel the disorder creeping up again. I don't eat as often as I should.
I don't know how to lose weight any other way than starving myself.
Funnily enough, that seems easier and more instantly gratifying to me than just simply changing my diet.
About two weeks ago I started taking X supplement.
Being in recovery during these unprecedented times has been so challenging for me. I feel guilty for the weight I've gained, and I also feel guilty for worrying about my weight when there are so many bigger issues currently going on in the world.

I think it is an unbelievably difficult time to be an empath - please try not to compare what you're going through to anyone or anything else if you can, and definitely try not to beat yourself up. I personally felt many of my old ED thoughts sneaking back into my consciousness while sheltering in place and dealing with COVID anxiety, and like you, I have also been in recovery for years. It really is irritating and frustrating to me when it comes back and the struggle returns. For me, I think it comes from seeking control during a time when so much is out of our control.

From what I’ve been reading in your posts, you’ve been working to fight ED. That includes eating rituals/routine, restriction, only eating certain foods, etc. It sounds like this was a huge step in that fight. Instead of feeling guilty, try to reframe it - your ED is guilty. Not you. But you know what that means? You should be PROUD. Because if ED feels guilty or threatened, you are doing the right thing. And that is amazing.
It also sounds like you’ve been fighting this battle mostly on your own. I urge you to reach out and try to find a therapist that specializes in EDs. Having someone to talk to who understands and can guide you through the distorted thoughts is so beneficial.
And you deserve that too.
You’re deserving of healing. You’re deserving of happiness. You’re deserving of food that tastes good!!! And most of all, you’re deserving of life.

328,06/19/2020,Update,tryingtobebrave,"I’ve needed to take some time away from the forum to sort myself out. While my eating disorder recovery was going strong, I essentially gave up on my mental health, throwing in the towel with self care, routine, even not making regular therapy appointments. I lived through distraction to avoid my feelings. I realized this was not the path I wanted to go down, and for a while being in the forum felt like it was pulling me towards ED when recovery was the only thing I had going for me, I couldn’t risk it. I feel badly for feeling that way, because I care about all of you so much.
I finally have an answer for jaw surgery, it will happen in August or September. I’m so grateful to have a surgeon who has fought for me.
I’ve been involved in some activism, and made a new hobby called diamond painting, I’m thinking of selling them to raise money for a cause I care about. I have an internship waiting for me after surgery, it may be one that I do from home so I’ll be able to work on getting my drivers license.
I’ve made an effort with self care again; doing trauma sensitive yoga that helps me release my emotions instead of avoiding them. Taking care of myself physically, and being involved in activism gives me a sense of purpose and helping people means the world to me. I care about all of you SO much, but with jaw surgery coming up it will be strongly testing my sobriety of five years along with ED recovery because it’s six weeks of a liquid diet, and I’ve found it a bit easier to maintain recovery by shifting my focus to working on other areas of my mental health that need work still. I will work with a dietitian again during this time.
I do struggle with keeping regular therapy sessions still and I really don’t understand why because I have a great therapist who I have a safe connection with. Perhaps it’s just some things I’m afraid to face but I know I need to, before jaw surgery, so my recovery stays strong.
I just want you guys to know there’s hope and recovery is possible. I never thought I’d get to this point but I am here. You are all in my thoughts and I care about you.
Hugs, courage, and love,
Braveheart",Blue44,"Sat,06/20/2020-6:17am",Hey! I’m so glad that you posted. I’ve been thinking of you. It’s so good to hear from you. Thanks for the update.

331,06/04/2020,hadaroughfewdays...,hermione3,Having a rough week life wise and behavior wise. I have not been doing well and my doctor is concerned due to things I see her in person next week but she checks in with me on the phone I have to get blood work tomorrow but I am sure it will be fine it usually is no matter what my behaviors. I somewhat hate that because I don't feel sick enough.work wise I am combined with another classroom and have a student who had been kicked out of my class and I knew this would some how become an issue. The child bit a kid and broke skin the other day and had to go home. This morning the dad basically told my current coteacher he blamed me and I am too loud and his child has autism and I shouldn't be allowed in the classroom...like what..it hurt me so bad I feel horrible I know the dad just doesn't want to blame his child but words are hurtful it made my coteacher feel bad for me and made her uncomfortable because he was rude...I just am doubting myself as a teacher right now and feel awful..my boss and everyone knows it was not my fault I mean I didn't make the kid bite someone but it still hurts to have a parent say such not nice things and questions my teaching abilities which I already do...I hate how things are at work right now and I was so positive when I got home from treatment and then the pandemic happened like a month after I got home so many things I needed to do couldn't happen and also now going into elementary education will be different also because of the pandemic schools are different...I just feel my hopes lost.,Miggi,"Thu,06/18/2020-11:09pm","I'm sorry things are so tough right now.

In truth, the child is just being a child and no one is to blame for that. The father just wants somebody to blame. And you said that you don't feel sick enough, the truth is you shouldn't be sick at all, so when the doctors try to help it's because no matter how small the hurt is, it is still hurt and it is bad either way to be hurt.",hermione3,"Fri,06/19/2020-7:05am",Thanks for the support it is really tough really now. I was going to be doing preschool then found out yesterday they changed it back to toddlers. The child was just acting out and I know that deep down it was just hard.

The amount of students we can have in the building is low and my classroom is very low on toddlers. So today I found out my coteacher and I will no longer be teaching toddlers but preschool I am a bit overwhelmed it’s a change and I don’t do well with change. It will also be hard because I am attached to 2 of the toddlers in my room and it’s a shame I won’t be with them. I also really need to get a handle on my behaviors it is just bad and I can’t go to treatment now especially with my boss trusting me and my coteacher to change everything.

The fact that they’re fighting so hard against this is good evidence that it is the right thing to do. For yourself. You are the only you. You are amazing, and you deserve to feel that way.

337,06/11/2020,Inrecoveryandpregnant,Sarah_says333,"Hello!This is my first time on this website. A little backstory on me. I’m 27 and have been in strong recovery for almost three years. I’m currently 28 weeks pregnant and  healthy, and baby boy is perfect so far :) my issue is that I’ve currently gained more than the recommended weight at this point of my pregnancy, and was chastised at my last doctors appointment. This was hard as my doctor told me to make changes in my diet (suggesting not to eat sweets or fast foods- I had only done that a handful of times throughout the pregnancy which is normal). I don’t keep a food journal but gave her a mental list of things I eat each day and she approved them and was puzzled as to how I put the weight in so quickly. Mentally it’s taken a toll, I’ve always put on weight easily and partly why I think my eating disorder manifested the way it did. It’s just hard to hear from a doctor that I gained too much.  It’s made kind of a “want what you can’t have” sort of thing and is triggering my binge eating thoughts. These thoughts are hard, and I don’t engage in the behaviors I used too to combat them (like restricting), instead I try mindful eating and reaching out to family members. Sometimes they just don’t get it- they say things like “don’t be so hard on yourself you’re pregnant” but it’s more than that. I’m juggling being pregnant and having an increased appetite and cravings, while trying to make healthy choices for my baby and not bingeing. After three weeks of this appointment  occurring I had a binge today (mostly sweets). Not only am I feeling guilty over it thinking I’ll gain more weight (rationally I know one episode of eating won’t) I’m also feeling guilty that I gave my baby sweets. This whole process has put a whole new spin on eating disorders recovery. It’s hard to look in the mirror, and I fear what things will be like postpartum. Anyone relate? I do want to reiterate that I’m under doctor supervision and my baby and I are very healthy. Just looking for someone who knows what I’m going through.",2Healthy4me,"Mon,06/15/2020-2:39am",Just try your best and try and enjoy and appreciate yourself for being fertile as many ladies with ED's have trouble ever even getting pregnant. Good luck only a few months left.,recoveryj,"Mon,06/15/2020-6:41am","I’m so sorry people have been so dismissive of your experiences and feelings. You should feel so proud with how far you’ve come! You’ve been able to combat the urges and the thoughts, and even when something did happen, you are able to rationalize against ED saying that in the long run, it won’t make a big difference. That’s amazing!! ED loves to get us into all-or-nothing thinking, and that can lead into despair. You are so strong and courageous to keep fighting, even when it sounds like so many around you don’t understand.
I know it’s hard not to worry. But try to focus on things that you know. Often times I find my ED likes to take fears of the unknown and run with them, making me feel like the worst will always come true. But I find that that’s rarely, if ever, the case. What do you know to be true?
- You are healthy
- You are strong
- Your baby is healthy
- You have a team that is helping to keep you well and safe
- You have friends and family that are here to support you
- You are doing your best to make good choicesRemember in life, it’s not all black and white - there are so many areas of grey. You are not postpartum yet; you have no idea what that’s going to be like. What you do know is how you are doing now. And from what it sounds like, you are doing amazing.
Congratulations on both recovery and pregnancy. You are so incredibly strong. Remember that things change, and that’s okay. You are well, you are healthy, your baby is healthy. And that is amazing. You are amazing

I know I have been saying this, but she is in the hospital again and she has a form of Sepsis where she has a yeast infection in her blood which is very difficult to treat.  It is very dangerous and more difficult to treat than a regular Sepsis.Add to this my inability to stop eating.   I eat as I type.  It seems ridiculous that as my weight goes higher and higher I continue to eat despite the hatred I have for the weight gain.  But I keep shoving the food in.  I feel like I am going crazy.

Overeating is bad enough.  I can't add self harm to that as they are dealing with the possibility of my sister not making it.  I know it has been a while that I have been discussing how ill she is, but she keeps getting sick with Sepsis.

343,06/10/2020,BrainOverBinge,kati_nixie,"Hi guys! <3
Has anyone been using Brain Over Binge approach to recover? How is it going for you?I've struggled with bulimia/binge eating for about 8 years now, had long periods when I felt recovered - like 7 months one time! - but then slipped back into the habit. Now I am in recovery and although I am afraid of slipping back, I am really, REALLY hoping to be done with it for good. I believe that' possible because the author of the book, Kathryn Hansen, has been recovered for 17 years now, no relapse! So it is possible for us, too. Curious to hear your stories, let's help each other here and heal together.

Kati",Jsweetwickedwitch,"Thu,06/11/2020-11:13pm","Hi, that’s great that you found the strength to recover, I just started my recovery from bulimia a week ago, and I’ve been going towards the “ All IN “ approach, Am underweight but not severely, and I’ve been so hungry and eating like crazy but I don’t really think of me eating as binging, but as me re feeding myself",kati_nixie,"Fri,06/12/2020-2:05pm","Haven't heard about this approach!
And yes, it makes sense that after feeling starved with all the diet/restriction attempts, our brains tend to send us signals we have to actually eat more.

344,06/10/2020,Doubts,bunnyteaparty,"I've technically been recovering for about a year now, and I've started looking back at before going into recovery and seeking recovery. I keep feeling guilty and wrong for the fact that I sought out treatment myself rather than someone making me, and that it was for myself, when everyone at my old treatment center seemed to have been forced or going in for non-selfish reasons. I sought recovery because I discovered more about what eating dsorders were and got tired of suffering. It makes me feel like I wasn't sick enough, despite the fact that I was diagnosed with anorexia and food and weight really did take over my life for years. It makes me feel like I was just going through disordered eating and was being overdramatic. I felt so motivated in the beginning of my recovery, and while yes much of that motivation did go down after realizing how difficult recovery was overtime, it just makes me feel so guilty that right at the beginning, I did try to eat the meals they put in front of me without much pushback, while I felt scared, I also felt glad to eat. I know that's technically a good thing, but it just doesn't feel like the ""right"" thing a person with an eating disorder would do. Now I'm just in this weird ""partial recovery"" stage where I'm eating somewhat regularly, but I'm still scare to eat certain foods and still keep certain impulses. I just want to relapse, I feel so guilty anytime I give in to my hunger and eat, but with my hunger cues being back for so long at this point it can be difficult not to. Right now I feel so hungry, but I'm scared to eat because I know if I did eat I'd be failing. I just wish I could go back in time and tell myself to never go into recovery, to keep going to see how long somebody notices, or until it's too late to recover. Funny how when I was in the treatment center, I remember saying that I was scared of relasping in the future, now I'm scare of never relasping. Does anyone else have any similar doubts and feelings? I just don't know what to do, a part of me still wants recovery, but it feels so wrong.",jess64,"Wed,06/10/2020-7:26pm","Hi bunnyteaparty! I just wanted to comment and offer my support. I disagree with you saying seeking treatment was selfish! In fact, it was self care and self love. It is never selfish to take time to heal your body or your mind. At the end of the day, any sickness that concerns you is reason to seek help, there is no ""sick enough"" - if you know your mind or body is not ok, then that is all you need to know. Sending you lots of love and hugs. xoxoxo",bunnyteaparty,"Fri,06/12/2020-1:30pm","Thank you, I appreciate the support!

I am only four months into recovery, and every time I have a big success or milestone, my ED internally screams because I'm letting go. And I want to relapse. so badly. I want to sink back into behaviors, but it's not ME. It's the eating disorder. I challenge you to ask if you really want to relapse or if it's your ED voice. I know it's hard.

345,06/11/2020,Feelingconfusedandscared,Jsweetwickedwitch,"Hi
I just started recovery about a week ago, and I’ve been SOO hungry. Am recovering from bulimia/ Orthorexia and am underweight but not severely and I’ve been having strong cravings ONLY for junk food, and am just wondering is that’s normal and If I should change, I usually never eat the foods I’ve been eating if I don’t purge, so it’s kind of weird eating them. Should I be eating only healthy stuff or bad stuff. Am just so confused, if anyone has any advice I’d love to hear it.",recoveryj,"Fri,06/12/2020-7:24am","Try to remember there are no “bad” foods. Diet culture has led us to place morality on consumables, and that’s just ridiculous. I know it can be so difficult to get out of that mindset. But I think it’s amazing that you’ve been able to tune in to your body and give it what it wants! That’s such a huge step in recovery. Often times, our cravings are a result of low levels of certain nutrients. It could be your body’s way of saying you need something right now. It may not be forever, but it sounds like you are doing exactly what you need - listening to your body, your hunger cues, and learning to feed yourself again. That’s amazing. You are amazing.

348,06/04/2020,Back,Tryingtoheal,"so i came back from inpatient and continuing to do great and improve.  When I got back to my cities airport,  I ordered an uber.  Here's what happened. started going south with the uber driver.  She stayed a block away from me so I had to walk that distance to her car.  Then it took me having to ask her to get help getting my suitcase in her car.  After getting in the car, she muttered I was inconveniencing her.   I asked her what she said.   In response,  she told me nothing.  After repeating what she said back to her,  she said today uber was inconveniencing her.   Her seatbelt was still not on as we continued driving.   I asked her to put on her seatbelt, and she said she didn't have to because it was her car.  I said I thought it was NC law to wear a seatbelt.   In a rude way,  she said im putting it on.  Then she proceeded to ask personal questions about where I'd been, and why i was in Charlotte,  if I was here to see family.  I said mmhmm, and she said in a rude tone, im being nice and asking you questions.   I told her passangers don't have to answer questions,  and as we were right next to the busy highway outside the airport.  she stopped the car, and said do you want a different driver?  I said if you're going to continue being rude, yes, so she kicked me out if the car because I felt unsafe.she also wasn't wearing a required mask.  She almost drove away with my luggage.   She wouldn't help me get my luggage out.I have since been in contact with uber about the situation  so that nobody else has to be put in an unsafe situation like that again.

All small sides, but of course when the food came out it looked like a lot. When really I was just vegetable sides. But my grandfather said, ""You gonna eat ALL that?"" And my brother quickly said to him, ""No, don't say that. It upsets her.""
Whenever someone accuses me of having an ED, I always say they are weird and looking too much into things and no one actually knows. But I think it's true. It's really hard to admit that.",recoveryj,"Mon,06/08/2020-6:22am","EDs do have a nasty way of always making up excuses. It takes so much strength to face them. Admitting them is one of the most difficult parts of recovery. It is amazing that you’re able to state that. That is a step in the right direction.
Also, how kind of your brother to step in! He cares about you so much! I’m so glad to hear that you have that support. Stay strong. Keep moving forward. I know it’s hard. But it sounds like you may be on your way.
Julesthefox",sadieelizabeth7,"Wed,06/10/2020-2:51pm","Hi Miggi, I'm sorry that your grandpa made that comment! I know how frustrating it can be to hear people comment (at all) on what or how much you're eating, and especially in a kind of derogatory tone. What I've found is that people that do that often have their own stuff going on around food and are only projecting their fears onto you. I'm not at all trying to say your grandpa has an ED or anything, but it isn't his or anyone else's business how much you're eating (unless it is hurting you, of course). You are allowed to eat whatever and however much food is enough for you, even if the sides aren't all vegetables. But overall, you are completely in the right to be shaken up by that, I know how uncomfortable conversations with family members that don't understand how their words can be harmful can be.

I started having eating disorder thoughts when I was a freshman, but I didn’t really start restricting until my sophomore year. That January, I entered treatment. Since then, I’ve been in and out. I’ll have some good periods in between where it feels like nothing can stop me, and then something happens, even something minor, and I start to slowly spiral. I always end up back in the hospital. The time between hospitalizations has decreased every time, while the length of stay has only increased.I’ve never been able to pick myself back up when I start going downhill. My nutritionist mentioned that when I saw her a few days ago and we talked about how I’m not in a great spot. I’m “at a crossroads,” she said, and I’ve heard that probably every time I’ve gone back to the hospital.It’s not much of a crossroads if I keep picking the same damn road!I don’t know what to do. I’m terrified. I want to be an athlete. I’ve always wanted to be an athlete. My restricting started because I thought it would make me healthier and more competitive. I have fun exercising.

I understand the feeling of needing to exercise so you ""earn"" the food. But that isn't true, you don't need to exercise to deserve food. Your body burns a lot a calories just performing normal functions and would need about the same amount of food if you just lied in bed all day.

You remember correctly that my husband hates his job so he is in an ill mood because of that. I would like a job myself but I haven’t been able to find a job. I’m really depressed. It’s hard to eat. I find myself restricting a lot. I don’t know if I am losing weight. I don’t weigh myself. My clothes do fit more loosely though. I don’t really know what I need as far as support. I just need my husband to like his job better. I see my psychiatrist again next Wednesday.

361,06/03/2020,Relapse?,Nataria,"Hi everyoneWarning for long postI'm new here and I've been struggling on and of in periods with Anorexia.
I've had large periods where I've been relatively recovered but with some chunks always luring in the background.So, ever since I started to get physical problems last year, I've started strength training (until I got scared of my body changing due to muscles). Then I've been continuing cardio training now and then since January this year.The cardio has been increasing, and since 1 or 2 months back my eating patterns have turned more restrictive, and I realize all my brain can think about right now is weight loss .Been struggling back and forth with really restricting and excetrcising to trying to lessen the excercise a bit and eat a bit more so I won't be super tired all the time. It goes up and down, it's hard, very hard.I have a psycologist for other reasons that I see on a regular basis. I see her mainly for my ADD and Exhaustion Syndrome.I've been in eating disorder treatment before, but this is more general and focused on the other diagnoses.I did mention this to her. They have been checking in with me now and then so that I won't lose weight or slip back to ED behaviours since I basically never go over the absolute borderline of normal weight many times a tad of underweight. But it's been manageble as long as I don't gain or lose weight, I'm still always terrified of weight gain, and feel really uncomfortable if I do gain weight.Because of my ADD meds I have less apetite during the days. It's been going good up until now really. I've been actively trying to eat anyway or compensate with easy eaten foods or eat more during the evenings when I actually have been more hungry so I'ved been good so far.My psycologist told me when I said I was struggling with food and excercise again that maybe we shouldn't focus so much on that but rather the reason as to why it's happening.
I agree with her, and I think it's a very good approach.However, eversince she said that, I've kinda gotten scared to talk too much about the ED stuff since it took much courage for me to even mention it. She asked me if I thought doing these things would make me get where I wanted in life, if it would help me maintain my energy. And of course, no it won't and I know that. So I've been trying on and of to get myself together . Then you're super motivated for 2-3 days and slip back gradually again. And after almost a week the ED brain is all over me again.My psycologist did consult with the ED unit we have nearby, she didn really get back to me about it though. It was more to help her know what to do about this right now since she doesn' have much experience with ED's.Now I just really am trying to tone down this ED thingie. Because I feel ashamed that I've been slipping , and I don't get why I do something that abviously will only make me more sick in the long run. Maybe she even thinks I wanted attention and that's why I brought it up. So i feel too ashamed to talk about it again unless to answer her questions if she asks me about it directly.If she thinks that way about me, I'd rather deal with these issues myself and only focus on the other issues I have with her.Last time I saw her she asked me some about the ED behaviours again, and I felt how I was brushing it over with me trying my best to change back to healthy behaviours. And, ''it probably would be alright'', just trying to tone it down. Cause I really don't want to make a big deal of this.
I did answer the questions she asked, but I felt like I just hid within my shell when it comes to the ED issues, and I have, eversince I got that comment.I feel extremely alone and sad about all this. Doesn't feel like anybody understands. Tried to talk to my bf about this, but it's hard for him to know what to do, plus, I don't wanna burden him too much about it. He tried to emphasize how good I've been doing and that he's so proud of me.
Which is really really sweet and thoughtful of him.But he also said that I wouldn't be so stupid to actually starve myself to death like *those anorexics* . Kinda really makes me feel hesitant to bring it up, 'cause I don't wanna sound like a failure. Doesn't just seem like he gets it. And why would he. I really understand him.I just feel very lonely and I don't know who to talk to about this, because at times I feel like I would really need to.Sorry for the long post.",jess64,"Wed,06/03/2020-7:49pm","Hey Nataria,
I just wanted to comment and offer you my support. It is great that you are posting and reaching out to people! I am sorry you are having such a tough time, but I wanted to encourage you to be honest with your psychologist, I think it is a great sign that she is trying to learn more to help you. But if you truly feel she is judging you, consider seeing someone else. You deserve to have a psychologist who can fully support you and help you with everything! I know it is hard to accept that, but you are worthy of the best care possible.
Sending you love",Nataria,"Sat,06/06/2020-11:59am","Hi JessThank you so much for your reply.Just being able to write to someone that understands makes it feel a bit easier. Or very much actually.
I feel very ashamed by the ED, and I feel like this is the help I will get right now, hopefuly
it will get better with time, or that I will be able to recover, with time. I'm trying, but it's like a war inside my head and decicions keeping on changing every single time I thought I was so sure of this or that.Since I'm in the general psych care right now for my ADD and Exhaustion syndrome, they usually don't refer people there, but only consultate. Which, in this case, feels very sad, cause it's like falling in between the systems somehow, or at least it feels that way.Thank you so much for your reply!",recoveryj,"Thu,06/04/2020-6:40am","I’m sorry so many people around you don’t seem to understand. It’s so difficult to explain EDs because the truth is, they don’t make any sense. Not even to us. And yet they are so incredibly strong at times.
I would encourage you to continue to be open with your psychiatrist about what’s been going on and what you’ve been feeling. If I’ve learned anything from my journey, it’s that EDs thrive on isolation and secrecy. They have a nasty way of convincing us that we’re never “sick enough”. But the truth is, there’s no such thing. And no matter what, you are deserving of care and the help you need. You deserve to be free.
It shows a lot that your psychiatrist is trying to learn more and understand. But I would also highly recommend seeking out a therapist who is specialized in EDs. It makes a world of difference just to be able to open up to someone who understands. If you have any difficulties finding someone, I know NEDA has a lot of resources to help you along the way.
Remember, you deserve it. You deserve to be understood. You deserve to be loved and live free from ED
Julesthefox",Nataria,"Sat,06/06/2020-12:06pm","Hi JulesThank you so much for your replyI couldn't describe it better than that. This doesn't make any sense, at all. And it's like being thrown back and forth from healthy to ED thoughts, and you feel like you almost have two personalities sometimes, do you get what I mean?One moment you want to eat healthy, super decided on it, and then the plan suddenly changes and oh my god, how could I even consider it. I need to do this and that and so onBut I don't want to get worse or stay in this, I do want to get better. I feel so ashamed of myself and like such a failure.Unfortunately in our system in Sweden, if you're being in treatment already, in the general psych care for instance, they usually only offer consultations, but they want you to be either there or at their place. At the specialized clinic they usually focu mainly on the ED issues, and then you will get referred to the general health care when you're ready.Many times though, I wish I could get some specialized help, cause it's very hard right now. Thank you so much for your reply. I will have a look at the online recourses, I'm really glad that it exists.Nataria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
362,05/27/2020,Havingalotoftoughdays,hermione3,"Been having a lot of tough days... work stressors literally 1 child making me want to quit..., intrusive trauma memories, body memories, dissociation, flashbacks and nightmares. I am exhausted and work starts up for everyone at my job next week but still split shifts and all different. I haven’t self harmed in 3 days and I have been following my meal plan. Saw my doctor today have to get blood work and told me I am very dehydrated. My new therapist does EMDR and asked if I would do it when things go back to normal I tried it a long time ago but don’t think I was ready...I am open but sort of scared. I hate feeling I want to restrict I want to lose I hate it all. Anyone done EMDR",iwanttolive,"Wed,05/27/2020-11:05pm","Hi there,I am sorry things continue to be so difficult for you.  As for EMDR, I did it, just don't remember doing it!!!  My therapist wants to work with me, a different therapist, but I don't know.  I find it troublesome that I don't remember doing it but the counselor that I did it with oversees the counselling center where I am now at with a new therapist.  My old therapist saw me one day and noticed that I didn't recognize her and I was with her for over a year.  She mentioned it to my current therapist and thought it strange that I didn't recognize her.  So I asked my current therapist to let her know how weird that is for me, to not remember her.That being said, I know it is supposed to be very helpful for trauma and is safe.  It is not hypnosis.  I would never do hypnosis.   The therapists are trained to know how to keep you from moving too fast and causing more emotional upset than is helpful.  That didn't make much sense.  What I do know is that a lot of people find it helpful.  It wouldn't hurt to try and if you don't like it you can stop.  There are different techniques that a therapist can use, different approaches.  I would ask her what style she uses and to give you some information on it so you can be prepared ahead of time.As for work, I love my work, but find it 95% stressful.  Today was so bad and then when I was leaving I backed my car into a parked car in the street.  NOT FUN.  So I don't know what to do about work either.  It is strange that something I love doing causes so much stress and anxiety.  And my parent's don't seem to understand the anxiety even though I have lived with it all my life.Back to you.  Just keep talking with your team,  I know it is difficult but keep fighting.  You are worth fighting for.iwanttolive",hermione3,"Thu,05/28/2020-7:47pm",Thanks for the support. I would not start EMDR until we are working in her office also we are still at the gaining trust phase of therapy I have not talked all that much about my trauma to her she just feels my trauma symptoms could be less intense. As for my job I tried to be fair and switch morning and afternoon shifts every week with my coteacher but the office now said it would be too difficult I feel bad I am taking the morning shifts because well appointment wise I can't get out at 5:30 and having therapy before work is too hard. I feel guilty and bad doing that to my coteacher but technically I was assigned the morning hours. I am going to be combined with another classroom next week working with a different teacher not sure how long any of this will go on but that classroom has some tough kids one who got kicked out of my room....oy I am stressed and work was pretty stressful today. this whole new way of things is just stressful and I hate it.,m1nz99,"Fri,06/05/2020-5:06pm","hi there! (i'm new to the forum, so i figured i'd contribute some support :) )
i feel so bad that you've been getting dealt such a terrible hand lately. sometimes it feels like things are going so well, and the the universe throws 10 different curveballs at you all at once. it's so unfair. however, every bad day you can get through is just another achievement. you haven't self harmed in the past few days? that's progress. you've been sticking to your meal plan? that's progress. you reached out instead of allowing your ed to consume everything, even though that would've been so much easier to do? that is major. i've never done emdr, but when making a difficult decision, it's always benficial to completely weigh the pros and cons before you reach a final verdict. i really just wanted to say that (even though i don't personally know you), you are doing the absolute best you can right now. and that is more than good enough. you have a lot of progress to be proud of. one day at a time. if you can get through one day, you can get through another. and then another after that. and another after that one. and so on. you can do this.",hermione3,"Sat,06/06/2020-10:57am","Thanks for the support and advice and pointing out good things that are progress. I text my therapist every night what I eat, if I cut, if I purge and I had a bad week but I had a good day yesterday and she was positive about it which helps me to feel better about myself. I text my nutritionist what I eat too and if it is not enough she sometimes pushes me to eat more or have a supplement. I am doing my best. The EMDR won't be until we are in person so I will talk to my therapist more about it then or maybe bring it up next session. I like my new therapist so far and that is helpful I miss my old one sometimes but I know it was the right decision to switch.",iwanttolive,"Fri,06/05/2020-10:20pm",Hi.

One day a kid bit a kid so hard it broke skin...the parent of the child who bit was kicked out of my class months ago because the child did not work well with certain children in my room and a parent complained their child was bit too much. The parent of the child who bit talked to my current coteacher and basically was rude to her and blamed me for all of it like I am too loud for his child's autism and I shouldn't be in the classroom. She tried to defend me but was rude. the office including my boss said they know it had nothing to do with me and the dad was just looking for someone to blame. I was still hurt like really hurt it put into question my own teaching abilities and it just hurt. I had a feeling the parent would not be happy with me in the room because of the past history but it still hurt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I go to school in Minneapolis and the military vehicles I've seen around campus are horrifying. I know it feels like this is so out of our control, and thinking about my own struggles (especially as a white person) during this time feels unimportant and selfish (at least to me). But I saw a post the other day about how there are so many ways of showing your support, without putting yourself in danger. Some of these include donating to bail funds or community organizations if you can, signing petitions, supporting businesses that are in need, spreading correct information about what's going on, and just staying informed in general. I know that can be hard, especially if the news is triggering or generally upsetting, but it's also okay to take a break from all that and take care of yourself. I'm still struggling with this as well, but you should know it is Not your fault that you can't be out there.

Please try to show yourself some compassion in this difficult time. I read somewhere that food is not just nutrition; food connects us to others, it does bring comfort, it has the ability to elicit feelings of a better time and to make us feel less alone. You are not alone. I know it may feel that way right now. And it is so hard to know what to do. Just remember that you ARE making it through. Every day. You are doing what you can to make it through. With everything that’s happening and everything you’ve been through, you are also still refraining from self harm. You have incredible strength. Remember to treat yourself with care and compassion. You matter.I am...not okay. I am also feeling alone and helpless. I have been reaching out and sharing information with anyone I can. It’s so, so difficult to see people I thought I could trust being deceived. There is so much misinformation going out, and it’s resulting it the pain of so many people. I am watching my community, my home be looted and attacked...and so many still blame us. I am seeing the police forces, the POLICE, shoot at people on their porches. Tear gas civilians in the streets. And people outside still don’t see.
It’s absolutely terrifying. I just want to help. I’ve been donating and doing what I can, but I’m so angry at myself that I can’t do more. I’m so mad and hateful toward my body. That no matter what I do, it always fails. That it is failing me now, like it always has. That I can’t do more and there’s nothing I can do about it. My heart is breaking. And it feels hopeless to even try to take care of myself - so many others deserve it so much more. I am reaching out as much as I can. I hope I can help provide supplies and healing. The police are shooting at medics. Stores are boarded up, and people can’t even get food. I feel so selfish for having an eating disorder when there is so much need. I don’t deserve to have what I have. I don’t deserve to be here at all. But I know that if I were to leave, that would take away from everything this movement is about. So I am doing what I can.

370,06/04/2020,tryingtocope,iwanttolive,I am really scared at how my body is ballooning up right now.  Even as I lay in bed with the computer on my stomach I see my stomach reach far above the laptop.  It scares me.  What I don't understand is why do I continue to overeat when I am so upset with what I weigh.  It seems so off that I am harming myself by continuing to overeat when the subsequent weight gain is horrible.My new life coach for eating disorders asked me if it had anything to do with my fears about my sister and my other sister and then the fear about my parents aging.  I had to say it might have something to do with it but I only see a huge body that is growing by the day.  I know weight shouldn't influence how I feel about myself but it is so difficult not to let it affect me.I know I usually try to offer hope to people but right now I am measuring my worth and value by the size of my ever growing body.  I am ashamed and want to lose weight so badly but the overeating kills any chance of that.  I am sorry for such a negative post.,Blue44,"Thu,06/04/2020-4:56pm",Don’t apologize for a negative post.

372,06/04/2020,Relapsing,Kilee15,I've been having this sudden urge to exercise every chance I get and I'm having trouble sleeping because all I'm thinking about is how much I should be exercising and how much food I should be eating.

I had disordered eating when I was in 7th through 8th grade. I started my first year of high school last fall, and I was in cross country as exercise. I was feeling very winded and weak when I ran. I wasn't fast at all and I couldn't even run for a minute without losing my breath. I couldn't even go up 5 steps. That's when I decided to open up to my father about my issues. I looked my symptoms up on webmd and diagnosed myself with an iron deficiency called aneamia. I told him that and he took me to the doctor. The iron deficiency developed because of my disordered eating and I looked up that that is common. I got a blood transfusion and felt better.

374,06/01/2020,julesthefox,iwanttolive,Hi.  How are you doing?  Thinking of you.iwanttolive,recoveryj,"Tue,06/02/2020-7:15am","Thank you. I am not well. Our city is in chaos. There are riots and raids. The KKK is here burning and looting our buildings. The protesters aren’t the ones doing that. In fact, when protesters were out marching peacefully, police met with open fire and tear gas. Medics are being shot. People on their porches are being shot and tear gassed. There are tanks and military lining the streets. I wake up to the sound of helicopters.
There is so much pain and so much hurt. And it’s killing me how helpless I feel. I’ve been donating all I can and helping fund and organize supply drop offs. But physically, I am unable to be there. And I feel like I’ll never be enough. I feel like I am part of the problem. And if I hurt, I get angry and hate myself because I don’t think I deserve to feel that way. I don’t deserve to be here. I don’t deserve to be able to find safety when so many are under constant threat. I’m so angry with myself. And I don’t know what to do. I feel so useless
I’m sorry to be so negative...it’s just...the complete injustice and pain that is happening right now, and that this society was built on is horrifying. There needs to be change. And I hope this brings change. But I wish more people understood that it’s the police that are attacking us right now. Under the ORDER of the president. This is terrifying. And I am scared",iwanttolive,"Tue,06/02/2020-8:08am",I am so sorry for your pain and fear.  And for what is happening.  It is scary and I can not begin to understand the fear that is raging through the streets around the nation especially what you are witnessing.  I am not going to say much as I think it best just to let you know I care and am so sorry for your pain and how useless you feel.  The feelings that you don't deserve to aren't enough.  That is real pain.  And the pain of your city.  So I will end here saying you do matter.  And I hear what you are saying.  I hear you.  You are important though.  You matter.With love and concern.iwanttolive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
375,06/01/2020,Update,tryingtobebrave,"Ah so many emotions.
I am struggling as my surgery is medically necessary but still “elective” and suffering from extreme pain is not considered in whether it’s important. But, my state representative called his constituents and asked us if we needed any help due to covid. I said no but he said to call his personal cell if I needed any help. If the insurance gives me any hassle again I will call him and ask for help and it’s such a relief because trying to figure it out on my own is so overwhelming that i melt down. I have found a way to exercise they doesn’t worsen my facial pain, but I admit it feels so good that it’s all I want to do at times. My current meal plan does not account for exercise, and I felt hungry at the end of today. I know the right thing to do is email my dietitian and ask her to account for exercise in my meal plan, but the feeling of hunger feels like a small thrill, I’m ashamed to admit. I’ve been doing so well with recovery but exercise addiction and the feeling of hunger are also strong feelings. Just looking for some encouragement to stay on the right path.",iwanttolive,"Mon,06/01/2020-10:57pm","Hi.  SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  good to hear from you.  I think it is great that you have your personal state rep that you can call.  I encourage you to call him as soon as you can and let him know you must have this surgery.  Explain is all to him and ask him to fight for you and to make sure you get the surgery and coverage.  I think this is a miracle that he gave you his cell phone number.  Go for it.  Be Brave, Braveheart.  I am sure there may be some conflicting emotions regarding the surgery but when it is all done and you go through the rehabilitation process, you can start to live your life and be free from all the agonizing pain and the difficult living situation.I know I may have stepped over my bounds there, but it was said in good measure.As for the exercise, is there a way to limit it to a certain time of the day, or allot yourself a certain amount of time you exercise?  I think it is good that you are able to move your body.  I know it helps me but pain keeps me from most forms of exercise.  As for feeling hungry, how does that affect you?  You like the feeling?  To me it sounds like your dietician knew what she was telling you and you trusted her all along.  Maybe she won't increase your meal plan and will just wait and see.  Wait to see if this exercising affects your weight. I know the mental mind games this can play out though.  I bought a scale last week and I knew buying it it was not the right thing, and I wound up giving it to my friend to do with as she desired.So count on me to say to you, you have come too far and fought too many battles to give in to the eating disorder.  Recovery is so freeing.  Right now you are experimenting with the exercise.  You may just want to drop her a casual text or email and check in with her and see what she has to say.  Can I challenge you to do that and then post and let me, or us, know how it goes?  I am here for you whatever you choose to do.I know that you will get the surgery; when that I don't know.  But it will happen.  With all my love and care",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

377,05/29/2020,Feelinglikeafailure,hermione3,I am not even on my full usual meal plan as I am not ready I am supposed to add something though but it has been hard and I feel guilty when I do well. I am anxious about work next week I am working with all different kids I list my whole class. My kids moved up to preschool others moved out of state I am just sad it won’t be the same. I am not working with my coteacher and I feel lost and sad and I can’t handle it they have tough kids in that class I am tired I just can’t handle much right now. Trauma stuff is hitting me and starting with a new therapist has been hard sometimes I miss my old one even if I feel I made the right decision. I saw her for 12 years it’s just hard. My parents do nice things but when I talk they don’t listen...like they offer zero emotional support and I struggle seeing people who are close with their siblings I feel such a loss because my brother abused me horribly but it’s a loss... I feel so alone and sad and broken also like my friend just published a kids book most of my friends have better jobs don’t need as much financial support from my parents. Still not over my eating disorder and trauma...I am just a failure,Miggi,"Fri,05/29/2020-11:03pm","That's not true! You are NOT a failure! You are a blessing! I can understand wanting things to stay the same with your class, but things can't stay the same forever. And who knows, you may love this class even more and it will be a new and exciting experience. You will get to teach and nurture a whole new crop of kids. Your guidance will be spread to even more people! I am also sorry to hear about your therapist, it can be hard to find someone to trust in that way. I get it, but like I said, things are always changing and growing, and we must change and grow with them. Also, maybe you should tell your parents directly that you feel unheard, because your feelings matter. I am very sorry about your brother, you are a strong person and these things cannot break you.

I want to do the elementary education thing I planned after treatment but those plans are just on hold but it is just hard. My friends are just further along in life then me I fail.

378,05/28/2020,Ataloss,iwanttolive,"Hi.  I need help.  I am struggling with my roommate who seems to have decided I am her enemy.  She seems to I just lost everything I just wrote...undo everything I do.  For instance, I turn the water on in the kitchen sink, turn around and she turns it off.  I put the ceiling fan on in the living room, leave for a few minutes and she turns it off.  She moves my things all the time.  She knows my Mother does not want me to go shopping as my sister is very ill and we are limiting exposure as much as possible.  I asked her to pick me up a few things as she was going shopping for her parents.  She said it was too much for her as she was shopping for herself and her parents.  I am too much for her apparently.  The other day she saw that I left the garage door open and light on that leads into my sisters room who isn't there right now.  She told me to close it as I was wasting my fathers money with the heat going on because of my forgetfulness.  I said you could have very easily closed it, you were close enough.  She said she was busy and it was my ""responsibility"".  I said there is no reason you couldn't have closed the door.  I did not and went to bed.  The next morning she was very angry that the door remained open all night.  I said I chose not to close it because I will not have you pushing me around.  She was livid. She told me it was, again, my responsibility as I left it open.  She was angry that I chose not to close it.  Now it may seem petty and that I am making a big issue out of this but she tries to control me all the time.",iwanttolive,"Thu,05/28/2020-9:49pm","I lost what I type so I am saving it as it is long.   She thinks this is her home and I am a guest.  She treats me with distain and thinks I need to grow up and act my age.  She has no idea of what it is like to suffer with anxiety to the degree that I do, and that the eating disorder is a horrible thing that I do to my parents.  She expresses how fortunate I am to have a company that takes me back after so many missed days or months.  I told her I was sick and needed to get help.  She just doesn't understand.So this brings me to tonight.  We ate at the same time, almost.  So I sat down and was eating and she ignored me, reading the newspaper.  So I got up and went and ate in the other room.  She then ignored me the rest of the evening and night being in her room with the door closed.  Okay I can deal with that.  The big issue came when I reminded her that starting tomorrow I need to self isolate as I am having a procedure done on Tuesday.  I am being tested for COVID tomorrow morning and need to isolate after until Tuesday.  The last time I thought I actually had it and she was so inconvenienced that she had to wait a few days for the results to come back before she went to her friends or whatever she does.  She never asked how I was or show any concern that I might have COVID.  So tomorrow we can not be around each other and I asked her to let me know when she would be coming home so I could get things together and bring dinner or whatever into my room.  She said she was not going to alter what she does because of me and she is not sick and wasn't going to inconvenience herself due to me.  I said all I am asking is that you call me when you are on your way home.  She said she would if she remembered but if she didn't she didn't.  I said you could write yourself a note to remind yourself, if you really wanted to call me.  I said you could do that if you wanted to.  Her deal is is that she just wants to do what she wants to do and has no concern for my feelings or that of my parents.  I feel bullied in my own house and I had to deal with that with my sister.  My roommate treats me with distain.  She is critical of how I eat, what I eat, what I don't eat.  Of my not exercising, even though I tell her it makes my body hurt.  I had pain when standing from kneeling a few weeks back.  I said my knees hurt so much just from kneeling down for a few minutes.  She said I was still young.  I said but my body is older than my age and I have chronic pain.  It is good that you can exercise and all but I can't, my body won't let me.  She just laughed under her breath and when I called her on it she said I was just too sensitive.   How in the world am I supposed to live with such treatment.  That she can't even give me the curtesy of calling me on her way home from wherever.  She never tells me anything about what she does, not that it is any of my business.      I really don't think I am asking too much for her to give me a heads up when she is on her way home.  She makes it seem as though I am asking her for a million dollars.  Signed
so frustrated",weouthere,"Thu,05/28/2020-11:37pm","Wow your roommate sounds so terrible and I am so sorry you have to live with that right now. I had a roommate last year that was very sensitive to messes and lights being on in the house and she would get passive aggressive about it sometimes. It got to the point where I too felt like a stranger in my own home. Something that helped was talking to her about it in a calm and clear way over text and in person.If that still doesn’t work, I would look into what your lease says about cancelling. If she is making you miserable and is not doing your physical and mental health any good, you should consider moving out. If you are unable to break the lease, try subletting the room and renting somewhere else. Check Facebook groups near your area for people looking for an extra roommate or for someone to takeover their lease. Of course you need to do whatever is best for you. Stay strong and healthy!! I really hope that test comes back negative and you find some peace soon.",iwanttolive,"Sat,05/30/2020-6:44pm","So my roommate was out most of the day.  And she did NOT call me to let me know she was on her way home, only asked me if I was going to be using the kitchen as she needed to use it.  No big surprise on that one. I had already eaten and was in my room reading.  I do not know how to deal with the hurt.And then my father tries to make me think and do things as he does.  When I needed help from him, I asked him to do what I needed the way I needed it to be done. He said he didn't understand why I had to do it that way as it made no sense.  I just asked him to do it as I asked him to even though he didn't understand my reasoning.  For so lone, so many years, I have been put down, criticized and told I am wrong.  It just gets old after a while and I feel like such a burden on my parents.  I am the source of the tension and the source of their frustrations.  I wish sometimes that I didn't have to have the call on my life that I do.  that I could just go to sleep and not wake up.  I am not suicidal and have no plans to harm myself.  I just am tired of all of this.",Blue44,"Sat,05/30/2020-7:06pm",I just wanted to let you know that I am thinking and praying for you and your family. I hope things can improve for you.

379,05/30/2020,work,iwanttolive,"I am in a conundrum.   I have to work.  I enjoy my job.  But....my job creates intense anxiety.  Intense.  so much that the other day I backed out of the driveway and hit a car.  Not bad,  but enough that it is costing me $750.00 that I don't have.  Come December makes three years without any accidents after I had two in eight months, most likely related to a medication I was taking that I have since stopped.  So insurance isn't involved.  I have a $500 detectable anyways.  So it doesn't make sense to involve them as it will keep my co-pay up and come December it will finally come down after three years of an increase.  I need to work because I have Medicaid for the working disabled.  I am stuck because work helps me get out but for decades I have had so much stress and anxiety with any job I have tried.  At this point I am unable to do anything else but what I do.  No one really understands the anxiety.  I am told why??????????!!!!!!!!!Why do you want to do things this way, or that?  I just said now to my father you don't need to understand why just know that this is what I need.  He would try to convince me that the way I am thinking is wrong and illogical anyway.  So he agreed to do what I asked him.I find myself eating at night.  There have been many nights when I fall asleep with food in my mouth.  I wake up later and find the food in my mouth.  To me, this is scary.I know eating in a semi conscious state is not good.  So that is it.Thank you for listening.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
380,05/28/2020,"I'mprettysureI'mrelapsing,Ineedhelpplease.",Floral_linen,"Ive been going through some stress situations at home and for a few weeks I had random thoughts about not eating. Like in those instances, suddenly it was normal to think, ""No, I can't eat that, too many calories."" And then I'd stop and think, ""Wait, what?? I recovered years ago. Why did I just think that??!""Fast forward a week and I had an explosive fight at home where I went to bed without dinner. They told me to eat and I insisted I just want to go to bed. I was too upset and angry and lost to care about food. I just wanted to sleep and wake up and it be over. They kept telling me to eat, I kept saying no, until ultimately I just went to sleep. It's almost like that triggered something in me because I started fasting. Not out of want to fast, but I'm afraid to have solids. Suddenly I just didn't have interest in food. Then I had fear of it. I'm so afraid now and I don't know why! I don't think I'm fat, I'm fine with my body, but I can't lie that seeing my body get smaller these past 9 days feels good and motivates me even though I know it's water weight at this point, and the more days go by the stronger I feel. I feel so guilty saying that.Anyway, I need to figure out how to break this fast without getting badly constipated like I did in the past. Can anyone recommend what foods I should start to eat slowly, or how much I should eat when I do start? When I first recovered years ago from a 11yr go with anorexia I had absolute agonising pains because I started to eat again way too fast. I don't want that again I'm so scared.I don't even know when or if I can bring myself to start eating again, but it will make it easier, more potential and less scary if I at least know how to start.Thanks for any advice you can give!

Ahhhh. Thankful to live in a safe enough place. Thankful that so far, we are permitted to walk outdoors.",iwanttolive,"Fri,05/22/2020-10:35pm","Hi everyone.  There is so much pain and fear these days that I think it is important to try to think of things that we are thankful for.  I think this can really help us in our recovery as well as lift our spirits some, when we see there are things we can be thankful for:
So here goes mine for tonight:  I am thankful for all deer friends, yes, deer not dear.  There are so many of them in the yard, coming right up to the window.  I love watching them.I am thankful for my one sister and the fact that we are reconnecting.I am thankful that my therapist took me back after I fired her.I am thankful for a new eating disorder life coach who is a Christian and understands eating disorders as she had one.  And the fact that she is a Christian.  And the fact that she runs a free online support group weekly.I am also thankful for my psychiatrist who has a group run by a therapist for crisis support.  I have more support now than I have ever had and one may think why do I need it now?   Well  I need it now to keep my head above water and with all that is going on in my life and the life of my family.So your turn.  What are you thankful for?  I started with one thing and came up with several.  Take care,iwanttolive",iwanttolive,"Sat,05/30/2020-1:58am","I need to remind myself that there is always something I can be thankful for.  Even when my days seem dark and there is a lot of emotional pain.  SO....I am thankful for my bedroom.  It has yellow walls and a neighbor was getting rid of furniture and put out a very nice bedroom set.  Yellow with painted flowers which are green and yellow, not too noticeable but subtly and very nice.  There are two mirrors and it has three sets of three drawers.  Then there is a tall piece that has about eight drawers.  Then there is the side table where I place books on. I kept the wicker desk which was part of a set that I had since I was 16.  I was given a very nice new couch that is small and perfect for my room.  I have a double bed, first time in my life that I had such a nice bed, and God helped me find a yellow comforter that was originally $200 and I bought it for $20.00. Yes, amazing.  So it is quite comfortable in my room. The couch came at the suggestion of my therapist who said it would be good to have something besides my bed when I am in my room to be able to use.Almost everything I own is second hand.  Not that I am complaining. It is all good.  I am thankful that friends and neighbors were giving things away and I was able to be a recipient of the furniture and other things in the house.So there it is.  Things I am thankful for.  How about you?  What are you thankful for, even if life isn't easy right now.Take the challenge and join me with this project.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
382,05/28/2020,weouthere,iwanttolive,Hi. Thank you for your support. I rent from my father. He won't have her leave as I am in a retirement community. We need her because I am not 55. My sister is seriously I'll and moved in with my parents house three houses away. I feel like a stranger in my own house. It has never been a home. My father doesn't think my sister will live to make her 55th birthday in November. When she does die this house will go on the market and I will move on with my parents.  None of this is ideal I just have to figure out how to live in peace as much as I can.  So again thanks for the support and suggestions. Hope you are doing okay.iwanttolive,weouthere,"Fri,05/29/2020-8:44am","I’m so sorry that you’re in such a tight spot right now. Stay strong and just try to ignore that nasty roommate of yours.

385,05/24/2020,THESCALE,iwanttolive,"Hello friends,I just want to say something about that scale.  Even typing the word makes the word seem strange.  I can not explain that one.  But what I do know it that it is addictive.  I have mostly stayed away from the scale because I don't want a number to define me and I do not want anything to control me or hold more importance to me than what God says about me.  I bought a scale the other day, knowing that this was not a good decision.  Things have been really challenging for me and I said to myself, ""Self, you need to get a scale and start losing weight"".  Well that voice is wrong.  It is stepping back into the bondage of the eating disorder world and to a place I do not want to go to.  I have to hide it so no one knows I have it.  That in itself is telling.  So why did I buy the scale, knowing how dangerous it is and how deceitful I have to be owning it?  Or it owning me more better said.  In my past, weighing myself x times a day brought safety in a sick way.  It doesn't bring safety.  It causes harm.  In my weakened state, I thought that it would help me, yes, have a form of control since everything around me seems to be spinning out of control.  But it isn't the type of control I want or need.  I am at a good weight.  I don't need to lose even though I don't like the ""number"".  But what is a number and why is a number so important?  Good question.  I ask you to ask yourself that same question.  A number is a number.  It will not own me or dictate to me my worth and value.  So the scale will stay in its hidden place and I choose to not have it take over my life again.  I choose to allow my body to stay at the weight it likes.  ""It is for freedom that Christ has set ""me"" free, stand firm then and do not let yourself be burdened by a yoke of slavery""  Galatians 5:1.  I have a choice.  Will I allow myself to be in bondage to the scale or stay in the freedom that Christ has given me.  I choose freedom over bondage.I choose to not go backwards but stay in a place where God can use me and where I can have a clean conscience.  ""I will not die but live and declare the works of the Lord""  Psalm 118:17. This is my life verse.  I declare that I do not need to be ruled by a number.  I want the freedom that comes from being liberated from the scale.I hope that my writing this recent experience with you here that it helps some of you to know your value apart from the scale, apart from a number.  We are so much more than any number.Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I wish you a peaceful day.iwanttolive",Miggi,"Wed,05/27/2020-10:42pm","Great job! You've come so far, you should be very very proud of yourself! I have yet to break the habit of weighing in with the scale, but your post inspires me.

I am mostly in denial about all of this even though I talk about it.  It just doesn't make sense, that she has suffered and been languishing in bed for three years and more than that even, having little life besides pain and suffering.

387,05/26/2020,Badday,weouthere,"It's been a while since I last posted which is probably a good thing. I'm back because I'm feeling worse right now than I have in a really long time. I am back to my pre ED weight, and I have been working really hard to accept that number and what I look like now compared to a year or two ago.Today was really nice out so my roommate and I decided to go biking. It has been about 7 or 8 years since the last time I rode a bike and I'm not a huge fan of biking but I was in a good mood and finally agreed today.It was really hot out and biking was much harder than I anticipated. I was way slower than my roommate and it took me twice as long to get up hills that she seemed to pedal up with ease. I can't help but feel like I let myself go, like my body failed me. I haven't been able to go to the gym in months and I haven't been working out at home at all so I'm definitely out of shape. I worked so hard to build muscle back after my ED so I could carry groceries in and go up stairs without getting out of breath and do every day things that everyone else can do easily. It really hurts to feel like my body isn't strong enough to go for a silly little bike ride when my roommate does it without trying.Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated, today has been really really hard and I'm worried this will make me slip back into old habits.",recoveryj,"Wed,05/27/2020-6:39am","Please don’t beat yourself up for this. Everyone has different strengths. I can relate to this too, as I often blame myself and my body if I can’t seem to accomplish a certain physical task. Try to look at the bigger picture; look at the things you CAN do and how far you have come! You have done so much healing in recovery, and your body has made physical feats that many will never even come close to. Your body has survived all it’s been put through, and you’re still able to do things like go on a bike ride! That’s amazing! Even if it’s harder right now, that’s okay! You probably are working muscles you haven’t worked in a while, and that’s normal for anyone outside of ED. For instance, I know that if friends of mine haven’t ridden bikes for a while, it’s a lot harder to get started again. The thing is though, you CAN. The comparing game never lets us see ourselves in a good light. Since your roommate has been asking for a while, she probably has had a lot more recent practice. You’ve been working on other things, other strengths. You AND your body are so much stronger than you realize. And you have done so much more than many even dream. Don’t forget to give yourself credit where it’s due. And remember we all have different strengths. Even at my most fit (pre-ED) I was ALWAYS the slowest runner. You are stronger than you realize. And your body is too.
Sending love

388,05/25/2020,BeingWatched,Miggi,"So lately my brother is always in the kitchen. We have a kitchen island with bar stools and he is always sitting there. Watching shows on his laptop or sketching. I have told him that I don't like it, but I didn't tell him why I didn't like it. I don't like him up there because I feel like he will judge what I am eating and he sometimes makes comments on it. And I am hungry, but I am very embarrassed and feel vulnerable when I eat. And sometimes I cook/bake and I want to listen to music and not feel watched. But when he is there he just watches me and I feel very anxious and I can't listen to music. My family thinks (but doesn't know) I have and ED and it is even hard to admit... But how do I make him understand?",iwanttolive,"Tue,05/26/2020-4:43pm","Hi,I can understand your discomfort at feeling and being watched.  It must be very uncomfortable.  Is there any way that you can ask your brother to give you some space while you eat?  That you share the place and you just want some time alone while you eat?  You said you told your brother you didn't like him being in the kitchen but not why.  I don't think you need to tell him why, but just ask him to give you space while you are eating.  He may not understand or even want to, but you need to eat and be comfortable doing so.  I can understand how it is to be watched, earlier on when I was so ill I was and it isn't easy.  I am glad that you are trying to eat and that is good.   But the additional stress of being watched isn't a good thing so if you are able to ask directly to have your brother give you space during meal times when you aren't eating together, a more direct approach, may be better than just hinting at it.  I am not sure the approach you did take but it isn't working so maybe just be more assertive. Yes, the assertive word.  I know it isn't easy.  It backfires on me when I try sometimes so I am not saying it is easy but it seems necessary for you right now.To be able to admit hunger is a big step forward.  I still don't like to admit to being hungry, not sure why, as it is natural.  That is your body telling you that it wants nourishment.  SO I encourage you to try again and let your brother know that you want some space while you eat, and that he can have the kitchen the rest of the time.  I don't know if this was helpful but I want you to know you were heard and understood.Take care, please let me know how things go.iwanttolive",ashley_5290,"Tue,05/26/2020-5:48pm","I go through the same thing with my parents. One thing that has helped me is to do opposite what I want, and just challenge yourself to be vulnerable. Just get your food like normal and do your thing, and i bet you the result is he won't care or say anything at all. We are often so scared of such irrational things and make up scenarios that will happen and what others are thinking, when were the only ones stressing ourselves out over it. You being clearly anxious and hiding things would only make it worse and give anyone a reason to be concerned or worry. So realization I have come to is that it's normal to be in the kitchen getting food and doing stuff, so just do your thing and you won't draw attention to yourself. Eating and getting food is legit something everyone does and you should feel no shame or embarrassment about it. Majority of the time like I said were just making scenarios up in our head and in reality your brother probably doesn't care at all haha!",Miggi,"Tue,05/26/2020-11:13pm","Before all this, I never ever thought twice before going into the kitchen but now it's like i'm putting my battle gear on and i'm bracing for judgment or people saying, ""Is that all your eating?"" I never thought that it's natural for people to just walk in and out of the kitchen grabbing food all day. Hmm",Miggi,"Tue,05/26/2020-11:13pm","I will try to act natural, like a spy, and be cool",iwanttolive,"Tue,05/26/2020-11:45pm",Ata girl!!))),recoveryj,"Wed,05/27/2020-6:47am","I’m sorry to hear it’s giving you anxiety. One thing that pops into my head is remembering my thoughts that were similar. Often times, I felt the most judged when I knew I was making compromised decisions (whether people were watching me or not). I’d feel anxious if I did decide to restrict and choose something to eat that wasn’t as nutritious. It sounds like your brother cares about you a lot and is worried about you. He doesn’t seem to know how to express that in a healthy way, though. Maybe if you are able to talk to him about your ED and anxieties it will allow him to be more understanding and compassionate. I’m sure he just wants you to be okay, happy, and healthy. If you’re able to express what you’re dealing with, it may help him realize that certain things may be triggering you right now and be more conscious and considerate of your requests.
That said, make sure that these anxieties aren’t coming out of a place of self-judgement. I know I often displaced my own judgements on others by justifying to myself that “I was still eating, so I was fine” when in my heart I knew I was making poor decisions. When I started really committing to recovery and making the nutritious decisions I needed, it was so hard, but I found I was only fighting one thing - my ED. I was no longer fighting myself or the people around me. And with their support, recovery was much more possible. You deserve that support too. And I’m sure your brother and your family will have your back no matter what. They’re not acting out of judgement. They just care.
And so do I

I became anorexic at age 14, and continued not eating until about 3 years ago, when weight started flying off of me. As it turns out, I had developed pancreatitis, and it was more effective at causing me to lose weight than anything I could do to myself voluntarily.After diagnosis, I put a lot of effort into putting weight back on in order to qualify for surgery. I made it to X pounds by consuming about X calories per day. I nevertheless had zero muscle tone and had bedsores from my office chair.Now, after surgery I eat X calories per day and can't keep the weight from piling on. I have put on X pounds, and now weigh X pounds. It keeps climbing!! I am not diabetic and I am taking probiotics to curb any SIBO. I also take supplements to curb cravings. I eat a very well balanced diet and I walk a brisk pace each night. I am RAVENOUS.I just don't understand why my weight keeps going up instead of down and why I am so hungry. My digestive enzymes don't seem to impact my weight at all, plus or minus. I've been told that I am exiting starvation mode, but I don't know what to do with that information. I do have a nutritionist, but she does not know about my eating disorder. Can anyone help me figure out why my weight is going up instead of down?

I'm recovering from anorexia, and I have been restricting a little over the last few days, but the reason I started restricting more was because I'm so panicked about how much I'm eating at night. It's only made it worse though. I don't feel like I'm eating because of any particular emotion that I'm feeling. I just start craving something, and eat a little, but then find myself wanting more and more. I'll feel so full and sick and my stomach hurts, but it's like my mind just keeps telling me to eat more and more. Is this extreme hunger?

394,05/23/2020,happy,iwanttolive,"Hi.  I am actually able to say that I had a good day today and have a feeling of peace.  My roommate isn't here and I spent a some time at my parents with a sister/friend.  No stress and a really nice time.  I am actually having my picture taken a few times, one a selfie which I can not do right, and one where my friend took one of me and one where my Dad took a picture of my sister/friend.  I call her that because she was kinda adopted into our family  over fifteen or more years ago when she was new here from the Philippines.  She calls my parents Mom and Dad.  We are her family away from her blood family.I am doing a lot better with the eating and am now able to exercise where I was unable to for a few years because of pain.  It feels good to be able to move my body again.I am working on putting the situation with my roommate into perspective.  She grew up in a home where she had a stay at home mom who cooked and was there all the time.  My Mom had to work after she went to nursing school.  My father was a pilot and was gone for five days, four days, home for three back out for any number of days so it was very difficult to not have consistency and my roommate doesn't seem to have had the traumas and pain that my family continues to endure.  So her lack of understanding, and her not having memory problems makes it difficult for her to relate to the serious issues my family has had to face.  She doesn't understand mental illness.  So I need to offer her more grace.So that is how things are going for me.  New attitude.  Hopefully it will last.Take care,

Im worried I could have a eating disorder but I really dont know. I grew up in a home with parents who dont understand struggles like depression or ED or anxiety, none of it, I have never been to a therapist or doctor, and I am to scared to talk to them about it, i have extreme anxiety around people and lots of depression symptoms but i do not want to self diagnose. I dont know what to do. I used to be a healthy weight but this past year I have been eating less and less, 2020 has been the worst so far, sometimes at friends houses i go the whole weekend from Friday morning to Sunday night without eating, i hate eating in front of people. When i am home, i eat as little as possible because whenever i eat anything i feel extremely guilty afterwords and hate my body so much. Im 5'1 and my weight fluctuates depending on what i ate. whenever i weigh more i feel so guilty and the only way i like myself is when i am the skinniest possible. I want to loose even more weight, i feel fat and ugly and unlovable.

They seem to be very supportive and definitely love you. and perhaps after talking to them, you may have the courage to tell your parents, and perhaps receive the support you need.being judged is always an issue, isn't it? I don't know how you feel or think, but if I were in your shoes my big fear of telling my parents would be that they'd, like you say, make fun of me for being anorexic. I honestly was also afraid of being judged when deciding whether or not to tell my parents, but I persuaded myself using my faith.I'm Christian, and one night all of a sudden I realized, I'm going to heaven for forever, why does everyone's reaction to me matter so much? My spot in heaven is sealed as long as I believe in Jesus Christ, so why should I care what people think? Let me live the way I need to live, and attempt to get the support I need.

I recommend telling a trusted adult, teacher, family member, doctor, or a friend. Just having someone to talk to makes it much easier. It is clear that you have an eating disorder, and there are many things that you can do. Seeking help is the first step. NEDA has some great resources, so I recommend them.

Like Miggi says, having someone supportive around you makes the biggest difference in the world. Whenever I start restricting, my dad (for some crazy reason) always notices, and always goes like, did you eat?, and then forces me to eat more lol :)You mention the pandemic and not being able to see your friends face to face. You could try texting them about your ED, which might be easier than talking to them in person (for me texting is always easier than talking as I am a socially awkward person).But you really really need to tell someone. Keep posting whenever you need it and don't worry I have just gone through the feelings of panic you are experiencing, as well as the needing to tell someone but being too afraid to. You got this.

You definitly need immediate attention to your ED. I always make the mistake of waiting too long to get help and I don't want you to suffer as I have in the past. It is much better to deal with a problem sooner than later, especially eating disorders. I know it is hard in your situation to seek help, but fight for your life.

398,05/20/2020,scaredupdate,iwanttolive,"Hi.  I am really scared.  For one, my roommate is becoming increasingly aggressive with me.  She has a very entitled attitude and continues to treat me so poorly.  We have had two big blow outs.  I apologized for my part in the fight, she just said it was my fault and took no ownership of what happened.  If I say that something she says to me was hurtful or unkind, she reacts so strongly.  I am dizzy with the anxiety.  I was tested for COVID and all she could think about was when would I get the results because she was unable to see certain people for fear of exposing them.  She was seemingly upset that I could have exposed her and people she had been with than caring that I was sick and could have used some acknowledgement that I was nervous as I had to wait several days to get the results. I do not have COVID   Very good.We just don't know how much longer my sister is going to live.  I lost the closeness and friendship I had with my Mom. I went over to their house twice in two weeks angry and so upset because of the way my roommate is treating me.  I get blamed for it and am told to not do anything to upset the situation anymore. That it is up to me to keep the peace.  I can not do that if that means being pushed around, getting the inquisition for giving my dog her treats, or cutting her hair, AGAIN.  For setting out Windex while cleaning a table out on the porch.  I was told, why did you have the Windex out near the food>>@@@!!!!!?????   I said I was cleaning the table outside.  She had put the container away.  So many things on top of dealing with the loss of my sister, the loss of my parents.  They just don't have any left overs to give to me.   I know I should just let them be.  I am going to stop going over to their house except for an occasional visit.   I am and always have been too much for themI am slipping into a depression and have the need to lose weight.  I bought a scale today but had to hide it and rip the box up into a million pieces so no one will know that I have it.   I need to lose x amount of pounds.  I know that this is not the answer but it is where I am at.  I have been a prisoner in my own house for the past five years.  Things go well at times with my roommate but if I ever say anything  about something she said upsetting me she says no one thinks the way you do, and you are just so sensitive and over the top.  So I am writing because I have been struggling for a few months now.  The overeating isn't as bad, but now I am in the phase of needing to lose weight.I hate the fact that I am afraid to be free in my own house. Afraid of being criticized.  The other day she had out all of the silverware.  I commented and she said yes there is sugar all in the drawer, implying that it could only be me that spilled the sugar.So so many things for too long.  I feel myself slipping back into the desire to weigh less and move around more.   I started using a machine at my parents but I would rather walk than upset them with the exercise.  I am depressed.  I am starting to feel a great sense of dread and fear.",iwanttolive,"Wed,05/20/2020-10:27pm",I am basically being blamed and I have no where to go and my roommate is staying. My parent's cannot deal with me or aren't even available for the little things. I am.more alone now than ever.,kylie21,"Wed,05/20/2020-11:22pm","I'm so sorry that this is happening to you. I don't have much advice other than losing weight is not the answer to solve your problems. Losing weight won't make your roommate or your family act differently. It won't make it any easier for you to deal with them either. It'll only make you more irritable and less able to figure out how to truly deal with the problems you're facing. Don't hide behind your eating disorder and try to talk with the people causing you stress and work things out with them. The only way to solve the problems is to talk them out. If your roommate is telling you that you're too sensitive, explain to her that you think she's being inconsiderate of your feelings. You are a human, the same as she is. Neither of you are perfect and you'll have to work out your differences. But the solution is never to lose more weight when the problem is completely unrelated to weight. Your body needs nourishment in order to deal with stress, don't make it worse by starving it of the thing it needs most.",iwanttolive,"Thu,05/21/2020-3:30pm","Hi.  Thank you for your thoughtful response.  What you said is what I would say to someone else.  I know what is going on.  With so many things happening, my other two sisters, I have four, just had serious health emergencies.  In the same day.  It is feeling like a prisoner in my own house, still can't say home.  The loss of the closeness I had with my Mom and my father always saying things that make me feel that I am too much for them to handle.  I know losing weight won't fix those things but it will at least it will help me to feel better about myself.  I know.  I know.  It shouldn't be that way.  That I shouldn't use weight as a criteria for feeling better about myself, but that is where I am right now.  I am still depressed but I got a lot accomplished today, dusted, cleaned, and now watching a movie.  But I am anxious about that because I am afraid of my roommate coming home and thinking I am lazy.  She is out all day and her comments make me think I am all sorts of negative things.  I know also that no one can make me feel a certain way.  I decide if I feel bad or not.  It is just difficult.  Thanks for anyone who is reading this.",iwanttolive,"Thu,05/21/2020-9:27pm","Hi again.  I know I have been posting a lot lately.  Things are back to ""normal"" with my roommate.  It is as if nothing ever happened.  This is how it always is.  She reacts, I react and we fight and then the next day she is overly sweet and helpful.  I don't quite understand it all.  But I like it when she is being nice to me.I don't know about any of you but it seems my family has had its fair share of trials.  Two of my sisters wound up in medical emergencies both in the same two day period.  The one is in the hospital and is getting help. The other is feeling somewhat better but why she is so sick is still not known. My mother told me I am in denial about my sister and how ill she is.  The one who lived with me and who is now living with my parents so they can take care of her.  There was so much abuse going on in my sisters lives and horrible things happening and it continues.  We can't get a break from it.  I am staying safe and trying to stay positive but not in denial.  I need to learn more about trusting God through the bod and in the good.  To stand strong when the winds blow, as a palm tree bends in the heavy winds. The tree doesn't break, but it bends a lot.  That is what I need and want to do with all  the seriousness in my family.  So many difficult things my family and parents have had to endure.  Thank you for reading.  I wish you all well.iwattolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
399,05/19/2020,StayingMotivatedandSelfDoubt,recoverygoals101,"Hey there,
I'm an 19 year old male who was officially diagnosed back in early January 2019 with anorexia nervosa, although I started to lose weight back in the fall of 2018. Ever since my diagnosis, I've been looking to get all the help I can find, of course with some highs and lows.I began talking to a counselor back in April of 2019, and I met with him and my doctors weekly to provide updates on my recovery. I saw a dietitian as we who provided me with a meal plan to jump start to eating more. I've found that once I am given permission to eat food, I find it much easier to actually begin eating. So once my dietitian told me to eat a lot more food, I felt that I could do do it.I've always struggled with feelings of hunger and fullness, and that's been one of my Achilles heels of my recovery process. Here we are a year later, and although I have put on weight since then, I have found that it is extremely easy to fall back into my old habits and stop challenging myself, despite the fact that I am tired of being controlled by my ED.  I very rarely feel ""full"", occasionally I feel satiated, but more often than not, once I eat I feel no difference in my hunger levels, which provides me with a kid of angst. My thoughts tell me that ""You're eating all this food, and it's not even helping you to feel full"", and that's a main concern of mine. I feel that although I believe I am at a healthy weight, if I continue to eat so much food, then I'm bring selfish, greedy, and I don't truly need it (because of my healthy weight).I've definitely seen some improvements. I have been able to go to the gym and put on muscle mass, I've definitely diversified my diet from what it used to be, but it's still not perfect. I have more energy now, but it comes at the price of always wanting more food.I believe that I have an issue with valuing myself, and allowing myself to have indulgences. My brain tells me as though they are unnecessary, and there's no reason for them. ""Why eat more if you don't NEED to"". As time has gone on,I constantly have to be working to keep my mind productive. I think this is because when I am productive, I don't think about food as often, and that's a win for the part of my brain that doesn't want me to keep eating, as it's trying to keep me ""safe"". Overall I'm getting tired of my ED controlling my life, and I want to be a normal healthy teenager who can go out to eat food with their friends and not stress about it all day. I don't want to be stuck in this structure that my ED has built, and I want to know if anyone has been in the same place I have. Thank you!",Miggi,"Tue,05/19/2020-10:06pm","I understand how you feel, sometimes it feels like i've eaten a horse and I am still not full. But bodies can be strange, sometimes they might be super hungry for no reason, and super full for no reason. It might be because it's lacking in a certain nutrient, or calories i'm not sure. But what I am sure of, is that it's important to listen to what your body is telling you. Even if the outside of your body looks healed, your body is still working on repairing your organs and such. And it may seem like a lot of food, but it is what your body needs and you deserve it. Also, food is not something that needs to be earned. You do not think, ""I should hold my breath every 20 seconds, because I can still survive."" But you do not need to earn air, you need food just as much as you need air. There is no shame in being hungry, full, or whatever it may be. You need food, and you deserve any food you desire! I'd say a few good tips are getting rid of the scale, stop calorie counting, and before going out to eat with friends say out loud in a mirror, ""I deserve this food, I get to have it, I am allowing myself the food."" That way there is less guilt. I hope things get better! Hugs and good luck!",recoverygoals101,"Wed,05/20/2020-6:00pm","I really appreciate your feedback! I completely understand how you're feeling. It's the sensation where you just finished eating and you're body feels like you just woke up after a famine. Definitely something I need to become attuned with, as I focus on allowing myself to eat whenever I am hungry, no matter what I have already eaten today. Your analogy was fantastic - you're right. Just because I took a breath 20 seconds ago doesn't mean I need to wait 20 seconds to breathe another. I need to do whatever my body wants and it needs. I think I'm primarily fearful of the unknown? What happens if I ""give in"" and do what my body is asking. It's a tough thing that I need to focus on, one stride at a time. I'm going to take your advice, and put it into another daily practice. Thanks :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I like to cook, and look forward to my next meals. And with me, a single pound can mean the difference between me feeling good, and me feeling bad. I feel so fat, and now that we are in quarantine, I feel that all I ever do is eat. I am so sad. With summer, I feel bored and it gives me time to feel bad about myself. I really need to keep myself busy but there is nothing to do. I feel so fat, and am thinking about trying to lose weight, but why? I am almost underweight.

I have also been in the same boat as you with the weight gain. Remember, your body fluctuates 1-3 pounds every day. The fluid in your body is always adjusting. Also, women can gain up to 7 pounds with their period. Your body is smart and know what to do with any extra food you might eat. And being bored can lead to boredom eating. But that’s okay.

402,05/17/2020,Stresseating,iwanttolive,"Hi there. I just finished a large stress overeating episode. I am so mad at myself. I know what started it. My ill sister has moved in with my parents. She came over with my other sister and saw a few dishes wrapped and in a box in her room. She asked if I did that, removing her dishes from the cabinet. I said I truly don't remember. She said how can you forget doing something like that. I told her again that I do not lie and I honestly don't remember. She basically accused me of lying but said she didn't. So I went to my parents house and before I left I went into her room and said I sent you a text about the dishes but you didn't respond. I told her I was sorry that I upset her and she said I don't understand why you touched my stuff without asking. I reminded her of the time she removed a very special hand drawn map of Nigeria where my pastor friend lives. She adamantly refused to acknowledge any similarities. I said it is the same thing, you   removed my map which is now gone for good and I moved your dishes. She became very deliberet in saying they were not the same issue even though I tried explaining how we both moved each other's property without permission. She then refused to watch a movie my parents  that we were all planning on watching.   So I said my goodbyes. I forgot my dog and went back and sure enough she was watching TV with my parents. Am I crazy or does anyone agree with me that the situations are similar?Thanks for reading. Long post as usual. I ate to deal with the issue of not remembering boxing up her dishes and secondly her reaction and dismissal of any connections. So I ate and ate. Now I am depressed",SmashThePatriarchy,"Mon,05/18/2020-8:56pm","I'm so sorry your sister couldn't see the similarities. You are *not* crazy! I understand why you're feeling depressed. Sometimes when I eat for reasons other than ""I'm hungry,"" it feels wrong, and I have to give myself a big old hug and remind myself that ""normal"" people eat for all kinds of reasons. It's okay. Be gentle with yourself - I think it sounds like you were very kind and generous in handling your sister's feelings even if she wasn't able to reciprocate. I hope you feel better soon! <3 STP",Miggi,"Mon,05/18/2020-10:14pm","Your situation is very relatable to me. I'm sure you felt very played and snided after she was watching the TV with your parents. Your sister was completely wrong in this situation, and she didn't even try to see things from your perspective. Just know that there are bumps along the road with siblings.

404,05/13/2020,Loss,tryingtobebrave,"I’m struggling with feeling surrounding loss today. My dietitian is moving to a job in a different state, and I have to find a new one. I haven’t had an appointment in a few months, but we had planned for me to start coming in regularly after I have my jaw surgery as it’s six weeks of liquid nutrition and I was told a certain amount of weight people tend to lose. In the past, weight loss has always triggered a relapse. Also since I’ll finally be able to eat and chew any foods once my jaw heals, I feel there’s a pretty high chance of my bulimic behaviors going out of control because there are a lot of “junk” foods I’ve been physically unable to chew for about two years...
But with my dietitian leaving, and having to find a new one, it’s brought up a lot of feelings of loss and I miss my grandfather so much.
I also had my telehealth appointment with my trauma therapist today and that was difficult.
I see my orthodontist next week finally so I really hope he’ll say I’m ready for the surgery because I’m really at the end of my rope with the pain in my face.

Everywhere you look there is always going to be someone to compare to. Comparing is something I really struggle with too and whenever I do compare I never end up feeling even somewhat okay about myself. What I have learned through therapy and treatment is that we can use comparisons for the good sometimes. They don't always have to make us feel like crap. When we are having a bad day, instead of comparing ourselves to others we know may be skinnier, prettier, the list goes on, we can compare ourselves to others less fortunate and be grateful for the blessings we have been given in our life. We can also compare ourselves to the place we used to be really early on in our recovery journeys.",march26,"Sat,05/16/2020-11:26pm","i love that thanks so much, I struggle with comparing also.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

417,05/11/2020,Edthoughts,tryingtobebrave,"I had been doing really well in recovery for a while. But something recently triggered the ED voice in my head again and it’s been sticking around. Certain types of foods, mainly anything “sweet”, or making my favorite beverage sweet. I used to be really afraid of it but in recovery came to normalize it as its the only way I enjoy it. But I’ve been berating myself for it, and today forced myself to exercise and now this evening am excruciatingly reminded of the reason i haven’t been exercising until I get my surgery; the increase in my chronic pain is too much to bear from any type of exercise. I even talked about this with my dietitian and while I never fully made peace with it, it at least had not been consuming my thoughts because I know it’s temporary, I can get my body strong in a healthy way after I heal from surgery and my pain is under control.
But after seeing someone lose a drastic amount of weight, I’ve become ashamed of myself because so many people said she’s healthy now and her old body was unhealthy, and her old body is closer to how mine is now in recovery. Before recovery I looked similar to this persons weight loss. But being malnourished is not healthy. Having thoughts consuming your mind about food and weight and exercise is not healthy.

And you are perfect just the way you are and have no need to change how you look. It is understandable to want to exercise to maintain a healthy body, but maybe hold off on it for now, or only do light walks. You need to give your body time to heal, and time to adjust to more vigorous workouts. Consult with a doctor or physical therapist and see what exercise your body can handle and go from there. Good luck!",recoveryj,"Wed,05/13/2020-6:48am","I think I know who you may be referring to, and remember to take a look at the bigger picture. ED has a way of giving us all tunnel vision - we see what it wants us to see. When we dig deeper, we see the weight loss came at a price. From what I understand, it had to do with a lot of trauma, so society glorifying it, just further demonstrates how much they don’t understand.
Another thing to try to remember is that weight doesn’t equal health. Ever. Everyone’s “ideal” looks different due to past experiences, genetic makeup, body chemistry, and even just living environment. I’ve seen a lot of people getting nervous about “gaining weight in quarantine”. But that’s the body’s way of defending! We are in a state of high stress and anxiety, and the body is doing what it can to defend us. Your body is always working for you. And if it’s telling you that you need rest, it’s okay to rest. It’s good to rest. Other things will come as you heal. Weight is NOT a disease. It’s a number. Like height. It’s just there. It’s not reflective of you. It’s not who you are. And it will never define you. You are you. And you are amazing.

419,05/10/2020,Braveheart,iwanttolive,"Hi friend,I just read your post about a certain person's weight loss making you feel less than.  I don't know who you are referring to but I am so sorry that what she is doing with promoting her weight loss is hurting you so much.  I know from earlier posts last year you had talked about how you had drifted away from God.  I do not know where you are with Him  right now, but I want you to know how much He loves you and treasures you.  I will not diminish how you are feeling.  I really do hear you and what you are saying and again I am feel so badly that this is happening to you.  You have, we all do, have worth beyond what we look like.  I know you know this but I also know that being sedentary and above your weight desire, it is troubling.  I acknowledge that I myself get upset with my weight when I don't fit into my clothes.  So I pass no judgement.  I only want to remind us that as the Bible says, man looks on the outside, God looks at the heart.  So there is some validity in the reality that people may judge us or we judge ourselves more I think for how we look or think we look.  I just told someone from my church that I a lot of the time feel ugly. She had no idea I think this and said it is absolutely not true.  We have skewed perceptions of ourselves or don't realize the more important thing, that is our hearts.  From getting to know you, you have a kind and caring heart.  I know it is difficult to challenge our thoughts about our weight and think weighing less makes for a better person.   But that isn't true.  When I was at my lowest and in danger of dying, I don't believe that but it is true anyways, I was not a nice person to be around.  I was angry, mean, I lied, I was afraid of everybody and everything.  I hated being with myself.  I was miserable.  Sure, I loved the fact that I was underweight, but that was about it.  It consumed me and made me not such a nice person to be around.  I say this with pain and sorrow.  That it caused me the relationships of my sisters.  Not so proud of that but I was sick.  I needed help.  And I got it and finally am at a much better place.I say all of that to express my love for you and to let you know that you are worthy of love and self care.  To not put yourself down for a number.  That number will change.  Most people's weight fluctuates every year at least.  We can not measure our worth by a number, or if we wear glasses.  I do not like wearing glasses and didn't for most of the first years I needed distance.  I would put them on and take them off but now I Need them.  I have gotten used to them even though I still don't feel comfortable wearing them.  We need to know that if we have freckles and don't like them or if we have a blemish on our face that people notice, it doesn't change who we are.  I know that this is the battle we who suffer with eating disorders and body image problems must face regularly and learn to accept the truth of what I am saying even though I am not always able to myself.  It is something to strive for though.  That is my hope for anyone else who is reading this.Braveheart.  You are precious and I care a lot for you.  You have had to struggle with so much.  Please don't watch her or read about her.  If you are able, find one thing God says about you if you can and post it somewhere.  Read it everyday.  Until it becomes your truth.Again, I am sorry for the length of this.  I try so much to not have long posts but it doesn't happen.  I hope that some of what I said was helpful.  Discard all that wasn't.

I haven’t walked out of a therapists office, but the psychiatrist I had when I was 17-21. Even after I was 18, it was not up to me if my parents were involved. They talked, he wouldn’t listen to a word I said. There was abuse happening I could never say. There was one appointment when i felt like my father and psychiatrist were ganging up on me so harshly I walked out of the room because I refused to allow them to see me sobbing. Soon after I went to residential and that’s when my life changed. I walked out of a group there having a panic attack, but it had nothing to do with anyone else. One of the other patients came after and walked with me to the nurse to get my medication. It was a much different experience. Anyway. Blah. I hate those years of my life. I miss my Papa. I’m acting emotionally distant with my dad but can’t help it, it just makes the absence of my papa worse whenever I see him. I need to start spending some time in he back yard again, get some sunlight. I’m tired of being in pain but find it helps to fine something each day to be grateful for. I bought my grade school aged cousin, who is like a Nephew, a LEGO set and had it send in the mail. My aunt called and said it was the happiest she’d seen him in a while. So my gratitude is that I made someone I love have joy. Ed wise, still having some thoughts that were probably triggered by the weight loss topic but have just stuck. I find myself feeling very guilty for adding a certain type of sweetener to my favorite beverage. I overcame that fear long ago and find that I simply enjoy it much better when sweet. It became normal, I didn’t give it a second thought. A big victory. But recently I find my thoughts occupied by it and I feel guilty for it. Like it makes me unhealthy, unacceptable. But I don’t want to go back to having it in the way I don’t enjoy it because ed says to.
I also did force myself to do a bit of intense exercise, due to Ed voice, and I did not enjoy it one bit. I feel much worse pain wise now. The type of exercise I used to do to compensate, there’s no way to do it without my face and neck moving in painful ways.

But in my mind it's, ""Look at that double chin! You sure look FATTER!""
I can't help it... How do you deal with these horrible YOU LOOK BETTER comments? I hate them so much... I think about it for days...",iwanttolive,"Sat,05/09/2020-11:19pm","Hi there.  I am sorry that people are so ignorant and hurtful by their comments.  During my first treatment when I was sixteen I was home for the weekend and a friend of the family made a comment about a body part and it was shocking.  That someone could be so clueless.I urge you to not let these comments derail you from getting stronger and learning who you are outside of the eating disorder.  I know this is a tall order.  When our identity has been so wrapped up in the eating disorder it becomes so challenging to step outside of it.  But IT doesn't own you.  IT isn't you.  It wants to destroy you and take your life and also to keep you from living.  I know living can be and is often scary at least for me it had been and still is at times.  I encourage you to not allow people to have that much power over you that it causes you to agree with the eating disorder.  IT wants you to believe that you are fat and fill in the blank.  For some, gaining weight is a life saving necessity.  For all of us, learning to love and accept ourselves no matter what we weigh is so important.  I know that just saying this isn't going to magically make your thoughts change.  This is something you and if you have a therapist will have to work on.  What we think about is powerful.  I have been dealing with a changing body due to being almost a year without a cycle.  Parts of my body are swollen and hurt.  I have to have a Mamogram.  I don't like this feeling.  So I haven't ""arrived"" completely.  There are days when I feel and know I am fat.  But then even if I am, I have to ask myself what is most important to me in my life.  I can answer that.  Serving my Savior.  Loving others.  Treating myself as He would want me to.  Learning to love all of me hasn't been easy and I haven't arrived.  But I am working on it.  For you, people are clueless.  They have no idea how a comment like you got can devastate someone.  But the very difficult truth is, we have a choice.  We get to decide how we are going to handle those comments, because unfortunately they will probably come.  One thing you might be able to do is let people know that you do not want comments about your weight or how you look to be made.  If you are able to let them know how it makes you feel.  I know, the comment. You look good, can be and is often heard as I am fat.  I often have felt like asking them, just look into my eyes and see the pain, then tell me I look good.  If you saw the pain you wouldn't say that.They don't understand and most of the time they are trying to show you love and support you.  I know it hurts.  I know how it feels.  But again.  Do you want to live another year trapped in the disorder?  I have found a lot of freedom in being able to eat without fear for the most part.  I don't count calories, I don't measure my food, I don't ask a million questions about what is in the meals if prepared by someone else.  I can go out to eat, or to a get together and not fear that I am going to binge or need to restrict.  I don' restrict.  I do overeat at times.  During stressful times or because there is certain food in the house.  But I am living my life.  I am free from the snare of the eating disorder.  Yes I so have body image problems still.  I still have mini binges.  I don't want to sound like I have arrived.  But I am not dying either.  I am not controlled by the eating disorder.  IT doesn't have me.  Jesus does.I know this is long but I just want to give you some of my story and how God has helped me have an identity outside of the eating disorder.  There is life after the eating disorder.  That is what people want for you.  They want to see you free.  It is a journey.  Again, I am sorry for the comments and how it makes/made you feel.  If you are able, see if you can come up with something to replace I am fat with I am getting my life back.  I feel stronger.  I have moer energy.  Something that resonates with you and will encourage you to stay on the path of recovery.  I hope this helped and that you were able to read all of this long response.  Take careiwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
424,05/07/2020,NotsureifIammaintainingrecoveryorhaverelapsed,refindingmyidentity,"I talked to my therapist the other day as I have had a lot of chaos happen in my life the past year plus. I've had past issues with eating disorder. I started out by working out all the time and watching what I ate at the age of 13, but by the time I reached 21, I was purging a lot. It was hard for me to admit it and open up with someone about it, but I finally told my therapist about what was going on around the age of 21. With some help from my therapist, I got past it and was doing very well with a few relapses in the beginning. Now to the present 5 years later, I sent my therapist some points that I wanted to discuss with her. When we had our appointment, she told me she felt like I was letting my ED take control again because of the lack of control I have in other areas of my life. I really was not expecting to hear that and kind of felt in denial and disheartened, but as I sat there and reflected on the points I had and the conversation I had with her, I get where she was coming from. I have been working out a lot even when my body tells me it's tired or needs a break and I avoid certain foods that make me feel uncomfortable. I guess my question is have I in a sense relapsed? Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to try and stop this from getting worse?",tryingtobebrave,"Fri,05/08/2020-10:35pm","This is not professional advice by any means, so take it with a grain of salt; just my personal experience.
I’ve been at the point where you are, and the fact that you’re honest with your therapist and seeking help before it spirals too far, my ED therapist called this a lapse/ backslide. To me it’s a point where you reach for your recovery tools and try your best to maintain it, before if slides too far. It sounds to me like you do want recovery still, and you’re in a difficult time where you feel loss of control in other parts of your life. Is this something you could talk with your therapist about; finding healthier ways to feel in control? Skills to use when you feel the urge to turn to ED?
You’re not alone and we’re here for you.",refindingmyidentity,"Sat,05/09/2020-10:31am",Thank you for your advice. I really appreciate it! I agree with your therapist in that this could be a lapse/backslide.

425,05/06/2020,beinghonest...,hermione3,I was honest with my therapist that I have a scale and I know my weight...and it is as always never good enough...I hate it I would be lower if I hadn't gained it back in hopes to keep my former therapist by doing what I was supposed to but led to a lot of purging and maintaining where I wasn't comfortable even if in reality that is the weight my nutritionist wants...I am going to tell her today too that I have a scale I told my therapist I would. my therapist said I am doing well with the meal plan my nutritionist has set that is more manageable I have purged less and mostly follow it. I am just struggling wanting to stay on this path. I am tired work though I have one kid is still tiring because I have been off for months and Monday I will have 3 kids. still not sure it was right to go back but no turning back now.,Miggi,"Thu,05/07/2020-10:47pm","The first step is admitting that you do something. It was good that you admitted to someone that you do indeed check your weight. You should be proud of yourself for that, it took a lot of courage.

I’m a bit in denial about how much I’m struggling with my depression, and grief hits hard at times. But not all of the time... I just focus on external things, like coloring, games, tv. I don’t spend much time in my mind except before bed. I feel I would be crushed otherwise so I use distraction to cope. Not a lot of options with the quarantine so I do my best to not let my feelings consume me. I’m more willing to work on my feelings with my therapist though. So that’s good. Still not happy with my weight, but following my meal plan. It feels like I’m overeating because I get no movement beyond gentle yoga. But I trust my dietitian. Im waiting to get my surgery still. Haven’t heard about elective surgeries. Surgeons office said they’d call when they know more. I likely will have to get scans again first and such. There are other patients ahead of me also. Hopefully my dental insurance who will be covering it as outpatient at a surgery center, and hopefully the nurse who stays overnight at home with me. But hopefully the insurance will understand about covid delaying things and extend the approval so I don’t have to wait a month and resubmit. I’m just taking it one step at a time. I actually find it beneficial to watch shows or movies that help me process my feelings and able to cry. My therapist says this is good.
I’m nervous because I’m leaving the house to go to my PCP in a week and a half, to get my birth control shot. It’s the only form of birth control that keeps my ovarian cysts under control. I always have slight pain when it’s near time for it but it’s something I have to go to the office for. I’ll have a mask and gloves but I’m nervous about being at a dr office.

428,05/05/2020,Miggi,iwanttolive,"Hi,  thank you for your kind words.First I want to say that I have struggled with eating disorders and disordered eating for over thirty years and have been in many programs and thus the ability to communicate my feelings and offer support to others as I know what it is like to suffer and have no hope.  But I have Hope.  I still struggle but not to the degree I once did.  As for a purpose in living, mine is found in Jesus.  This may sound religious but it is not.  He is real to me, real period.  If it weren't for Jesus loving me and keeping me alive I wouldn't be.  I begged Him daily to take me home in my sleep.  I desperately wanted to die to get away from the pain and suffering brought on by the eating disorder and depression and fear of just about everything.  I am happy He didn't answer those pleas because even though daily I still have to deal with a lot, and I mean A LOT, I know there is a purpose far beyond this temporal world. I believe it is important for me to share my faith with others even those who do not deal with eating disorders, but just have pain.  I know there is an afterlife and I want to share this with people.  This is my purpose.  Serving Jesus and His love with others.  Living for Him.  This is not to say I don't suffer.  I do.  My sister is not going to be with us much longer and I don't know how much longer.   It may be months or weeks or six months.  We don't know.  So then I have to deal with the loss of my relationship with my mother as it once was due to her high stress level, etc.   I could go on but won't.  I only say these things to let you know that every day is a day in which I get to choose how I am going to face these struggles.  Some days I don't do such a great job.  But what gives me purpose is sharing what I have learned.  Letting others know they don't have to be perfect to have a purpose and help others.  This can be even easier for people to relate to as the other person doesn't feel guilty for messing up when I ""have it all together"".  I won't have it all together until I am in heaven.  I know that Jesus loves me and I love Him because of His love for me.  I don't have to earn His love, He took my sin and forgave me and when I accepted this gift of salvation, I don't have to cross my T's and dot my whatever.  He did it all.  My job now is to honor Him with my life and allow Him to change me.  We can come to Him all messy and it is His job to help clean us up, with our cooperation.  That is my purpose.  To keep allowing Jesus to clean me up, to live for Him as best as I can and to share with others what I have learned along the way.I am far from perfect or from having it all together.  I still need help and support.  But I am also able to offer support to others and love my neighbors and the ladies I work for.  To get up when I fall down. I am sorry you are struggling so much.  I understand.  Braveheart, or tryingtobebrave as her regular user name is, has just posted how she is sending some cards to people on the front lines, the hospital workers.  That is a beautiful purpose.  To give to others.  If you can find something that would help you give to others in any small way that would help, I think, to help you get away at least for a while the thinking of calories and food.  I color Mandala's and find it helps me to distract from thinking about stuff.  I was running a weekly Bible study at my house. I NEVER thought I could do that, but God has helped me grow in this over the past two years.  The ladies keep coming back so we have bonded.  I know this is long but I hope it helped answer some of your questions. I know I talked about Jesus but I can not share what my purpose in living is without taking about Him, as He is my purpose. My favorite scripture verse is ""I will not die but live and declare the works of the Lord"".  Psalm 118:17   I never thought I would want to live because the pain was too great, the suffering too much.  But God has helped me with this and now I want to tell every one about how much Jesus loves them and help people as much as I am able.  Long answer to your question.  I hope it helps.  Please ask me any questions you may have.  I am more than happy to try to answer them.  Take care,iwanttolive",Miggi,"Tue,05/05/2020-4:41pm","Thank you for taking the time to respond. I find faith in the lord and find myself asking him to keep me below a certain number, even if I know a number that low is unhealthy.

And if I complete it, I think it will be enough",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But today I actually felt like I did something that matters and is within my capabilities.
A local news article was a hospital here asking people to send cards to nurses and patients in the icu to give them encouragement. So I colored some pictures with hopeful affirmations and I’m sending them in. It’s not much, but the nurses say it does help them to get the encouragement and helping others is the most rewarding experience in life for me.

I am really going to try with my new therapist and hope that things improve outpatient I have to live I just have to exist in this world I can't keep going to treatment.

437,05/03/2020,SO.....,iwanttolive,"Hi again, it is me with more roommate problems. I feel that in light of what is going on I shouldn't be so upset and post but I can not share this with my parents anymore as it isn't appropriate anyways and then my Mom is so stressed with my sisters ill health that I won't dare to talk with her about it, so it is you all....So this is the sad state of affairs in the way she treats me.  She puts me down so often now in just everyday stuff.  For instance, I bought baggies for the house, my money.  We share a food item that needs sealed. Since she uses tape and we don't have much, I said I was going to put them in the baggie I just bought.  She was quite upset with ""my"" way of doing things and said we should not open that box as we have one open.  I said it is a gallon size and we only need a quart size.  She then said you do things very different than I do. I think it is a waste to use that bag when this one is used and you just waste.  I said, no, I don't.  I reuse bags and there is no reason to use the one that is too large for what purpose it is serving.  She then said we or YOU only started reusing bags since COVID.  I said that is not true and I am not going to pinch penny's.  She then said she bought toilet paper and thus she was not going to help pay for my purchases which included several house hold items.  I said I never asked you to.  I feel that no matter what I do I am looked down upon.  She started putting me down in front of someone the other day or maybe it was just the two of us.  She was putting me down and I just said her name, like come on already.  Several times.  She has also been commenting on the fact that I give my dog treats, get this....EVERY DAY!!!   Can you believe this horrible act I am committing?!!  I said yes I do.  I don't let her tell me that she wants one, because she does.  My dog has a canny way of telling me just what she wants....She said we had dogs all my life and we never.... and we never did that or this.... Our dogs were hunting dogs and stayed outside until it was cold. I said I am glad I wasn't your dog.But enough already.  Putting me down for opening a box of baggies and then saying I do things way different than she does, inferring that I am wasteful and so not good enough.  She and I had always shared the vacuuming.  We still do.  We always would vacuum the others room if the door was open.  She has stopped doing this.  I have no idea why.  She will vacuum the house and her room, my room is directly across from hers but she stopped about two weeks ago maybe three.  She no longer does it.  There is always criticism.  She appears to be nice but underneath it is distain and an attitude of entitlement.  She rents from my father. She tries to tell me how to interact with my Dad, that we should give him money for this or that.  I said he gave it to us from the food pantry.  Or he just wanted to give it to me.  Plain and simple.  As long as she is getting her way and her needs met, great.  But if I step the wrong way forget it.  I lived this way all my life and should not be living this way now.  There is no changing the living arrangements.  I need to change to adjust my attitude and reaction to this insult.  I need to not allow her to get under my skin and just let her do her thing and not be so upset.Thanks for letting me share my hurt with you.  It would be one thing if this happened only once in a while, but it is all the time.  Until the next time.  It is like the peace waiting for the storm.  Never knowing when it will strike.  And then peace until the storm.  I need to take refuge in the Mighty Fortress Who is my God.Again, thanks for listening.  No apologies for sharing.and I still wanttolive",alwaysthinking,"Sun,05/03/2020-6:17pm","Yep, there are some people whom you will never be able to please or do anything ""right.""  Hang in there.

I know it may not be possible, but I think it would be good for your mental health to find a new roomate. It just isn't working out. But I understand that it might not be doable at the moment. I suggest talking with them using I statements. Like instead of saying, ""You never do dishes!"" Say, ""I feel tired today, can you please take care of the dishes?"" It will be an uphill battle, but communication and trying to thwart arguments is key. I wish you luck!",iwanttolive,"Sun,05/03/2020-8:17pm","Thanks for that but it doesn't work.  She takes offense if I say anything to her about what she does or doesn't do.  And I statements, well, done that and no luck.  She turns into this creature and it is ugly.  So I do my best.  For instance, I know she wants to watch a particular program that she thought cost money.  That is because there are two identical programs with the same name.  Both having to do with end times according to the Bible. One is a movie and that costs.  The other is a documentary and it doesn't.  So she is out on a walk and when she gets back she will be happy that I found it for her.  \I do my best and most of the time we are okay, until the digs, ie, the dog biscuits. That is a strange way to spell that word but the dictionary said so so there it is.  Why does she have to be commenting on those.  Makes no sense to me.  Anyhow I will watch this with her and it will be a pleasant evening unless she decides it is too late.  But that will be her choice.  I found it for her.  I try.  She is just one of a kind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
438,05/02/2020,Braveheart,iwanttolive,"Hi there friend.I am thinking of you and wondering how you are doing today?  I know how much you are struggling with grief and pain.  You are a warrior and I am proud of you for the way you keep pushing through the fog and darkness.  Just KNOW that there is light at the end of this and Jesus is with you even if you are feeling far from Him.  He loves you.  He is holding onto you even if you are not able to hold onto Him.  That is what is so wonderful about our God.  He never leaves us, never abandons us.  His love for you is deep and wonderful.  Rest in His love.I love you friend",tryingtobebrave,"Sat,05/02/2020-10:23pm","My brains a bit scattered as usual, but this post gives me strength. Yes, I am brave. But I don’t do it alone; it’s my loved ones including you guys that give me the support to keep marching on.
My grandmother on my fathers side abandoned me when I called her in danger and crisis when I was five years old, my dad ended that call but she never called back to see if I was safe or called the authorities. I don’t understand how someone can turn their back on any child; even more so one they “love”. I don’t think she loved me. Maybe she couldn’t. I hope my grandpa did. I hope those positive memories weren’t a lie. I learned that day at five years old to never ask for help again because I can’t rely on anyone.i told my mom about this today as my dad got us food and *one* tiny thing was wrong with his order so he stormed out to demand a new one. He is very entitled and it disgusts me. It disgusts me he threw away a perfectly good meal. He was angry at my mom when she tried to tell him to just fix what was wrong a bit. So I ate with an anxious pit in my stomach and didn’t enjoy the meal at all because of that. And she unburdened about him, and I told her about my grandmother turning her back because my mom never knew. My mom said she also tried to talk to her about his behavior when I was young but she wouldn’t say anything, she just protected him. Now, I am so so grateful I learned that’s not the truth. I have all of you and a few close friends who I do trust, who I have asked for help, who have supported me. I know I had my grandparents on my moms side who I loved dearly and yes the grief is there. But I finally had a more positive moment today where I just feel grateful. Thank you for being my friend. I reached out to my close friends and told them I appreciate them. I think it’s important to tell your loved ones that you care about them and appreciate them because you never know how much time you’ll have. Like you did for me with this post :-)

I have not been doing well but wondering if the structure will help and getting back into a routine. I am working the afternoon to night shift and it is hard with my appointments my doctors are not working their same hours. My therapist can meet before my time at work but it makes it cutting it close to having to get to work its an hour and a half before my shift and I am 5 minutes from work. I have to get 5 minutes before to get my temperature taken. I am not sure it was the right choice but its decided now.,alwaysthinking,"Fri,05/01/2020-8:16pm","Is this still at the child care center?

It is not a full shift even and I am alone with the kids so it is no more then 4. There are 3 classrooms open.. I am anxious and hoping I can get eating on track.

442,04/30/2020,Beingaway,tryingtobebrave,"Well not really away, because I read all of your posts, I just struggle to respond because I feel like a ghost right now. Like I’m in a constant haze.
I’ve really shut out my feelings and grief by constantly having my mind occupied during the day. But today talking with my therapist I realized I’m not actually doing okay like I thought. When feelings do come through I use unhealthy coping mechanisms sometimes. It’s not healthy to feel numb all the time. I would have lost my sobriety if quarantine wasn’t happening. I cry myself to sleep because distractions are gone at night. I dream of my grandparents dying over and over. Being around my dad can be frustrating because I wish my grandpa was here and not him, then I feel like a wretched person for feeling that way even if due to my childhood it makes sense.
My grandmother on my dads side, I’ve had thoughts I wish I didn’t. I remember acutely, one of my earliest memories, calling her for help. I was terrified and told her what happened. Nothing ever came of it. I’m not going into details, but she didn’t even check if I was safe for days. She knew I needed urgent help and did nothing, she protected my dad instead of me. My moms parents, my papa, would have immediately gotten me help. I feel a distance and sadness about that whole thing and i don’t feel bad for not being as close to my dads mom anymore.
See, I prefer to not think about any of this. So I don’t. I avoided therapy for too long, my therapist wants me to get back to a regular schedule, but I haven’t done that yet because I hate addressing these issues. I prefer the dissociative haze. But I’m really sorry I haven’t been responding much. I care about all of you.",tryingtobebrave,"Thu,04/30/2020-10:28pm","I feel I need to note that I have only fond memories of my dads father. He died in 2011 and I don’t know if he knew I needed help, if my grandma said anything to him. Because I have only those fond memories and I don’t want their abandoning me when I was in a crisis to ruin it.",Miggi,"Thu,04/30/2020-11:26pm","I'm sorry this is happening. You are in fight or flight mode right now, and that is probably why you feel numb. It's because you are in middle of the hard part, and now you have to pull the sails and brace for the storm. It's a difficult situation your in. But, you have done so well and fought so hard, you can survive this!I think to end the feeling of numbness, you have to reach clear skies and talk through your trauma. It may hurt, but like a sore muscle, you will regrow stronger. I wish you all the hugs in the world!",tryingtobebrave,"Fri,05/01/2020-12:13am",I agree with everything you said. Thank you for the encouragement! Hugs!,iwanttolive,"Thu,04/30/2020-11:41pm","It is interesting that you wrote what you did about numbing your feelings and preferring the ""haze"" to feeling feelings.  I wrote about how my sister's decision to go onto hospice, which actually wasn't her decision after all but my sister out in California's, but after a wonderful day of good choices and going to the produce store for the first time really, but for the first shopping since COVID, I bought veggies, and made dinner and made a nice dessert type food to freeze, and had dinner with my roommate, all good things; but when I heard of my sister's decision I chose, yes, a deliberate decision to eat.  To numb.  I knew what I was doing.  Then I came home, I watched a movie with my sister and my parents, and when I came home I planned on eating more, but I chose to not.  Again a choice.  Under alwaysthinkings post I wrote how nothing, not any of the ways we can use to numb the pain, whether is it is using drugs, alcohol, food, lack of food, anything to numb, will only keep us numb until we need another fix.  Eventually we have to come to the point where we face the pain, the trauma head on.  It seems like you are there.  You have been through so much and to have an adult, grandparent or not, dismiss your fears and abandon you as your grandmother did is atrocious.  It is abhorrent.  I can see why you don't have fond memories of her.  The what ifs and if only she...and the fact that you are living with your father-it must be so difficult.  I just had a thought pop into my head and I may be way off, but do is there any way that your face pain might be a way of hiding?  I am not saying you do not have legitimate pain from the facial structure problems, but it does keep you away from most of the interactions at home, I think.  Do you think the pain might be worse because it is keeping you safe?  This is NOT a judgement but of sincere concern and maybe something you can talk with your therapist about.  You do not have to answer here.  I don't want to put you on the spot.  I know you want to get your own place, so do I.  But I will be here until I turn 55.  Three more years.  I actually love where I live.  My roommate has her moments and trashes me but then she seems to forget it after a day and then things go back to normal until the next thrashing.  I can live with that.As far as not responding to posts, you need to take care of you right now.  I know you love me and care about me.  I want you to do what you need to do to get through this time.  I pray for you and care about you.  This is your time to heal.  Your therapist sounds really gentle and kind.  I think she thinks you are ready.  I think you think you are ready as well.  I pray God's peace and gentle hand to guide you through this walk.
I love you my friend.",tryingtobebrave,"Fri,05/01/2020-12:12am","Thank you for taking the time to respond.
I’ve never considered that before, about how the pain makes it easier to avoid the conflict between my parents. To stay in my own world in the garden or my room. I think that yes it does, but it also (before covid) kept me from seeing my friends as often as I would like to and not being able to start my internship yet. So it’s a double edged sword. I suppose if I had to find one positive thing in the hardship of this pain, at least for quarantine, it does keep me from too many family interactions. Though I honestly would keep to my room or the yard regardless of whether I had pain or not, for the sake of my mental health and sanity.

I don’t deserve it but I know doing this will keep me out of residential... and I can’t afford to go to treatment again....I just hate myself when I eat...or do my supplements my nutritionist doesn’t even know my weight ugh I hate this,iwanttolive,"Tue,04/28/2020-10:23pm","Hi there.  I am glad you are doing better but am concerned with how much hatred you have toward yourself when you do eat.  Have you been able to identify what it is that makes it so difficult to eat, or nurture your body?  That word nurture...makes me wonder if nurturing yourself in other ways is as difficult.  There are times I just need hugs and even, and this is embarrassing, but I sometimes just need to be held.  I am 52 and not married.  So I guess it isn't all that strange that I would want to be held as I don't have that in a relationship. I don't want that.  But I do need to be held every once in a while.So I don't know about you but taking care of yourself, buying yourself things you want not just need, are you able to do any of those types of things or is it similar to when you eat? I don't know why I am asking these questions.  I just have the thoughts running through my fingers.  So I hope you don't mind. I think it may help you understand more about yourself and I hope it might help in some way.I know that when I struggled with the anorexia, doing well meant getting better and getting better was scary.  I know those who struggle with anorexia understand this but it may seem strange to those who haven't experienced it.  There is some security in the identity of the illness.  I have really learned that if I place my identity in anything else other than who Jesus says I am I am really lost.  In the past several months I have been struggling with overeating and the subsequent weight gain.  I have had to take a good look at myself and ask myself why does it matter so much to me.  Especially when I am healthy and able to walk and work part time and have all the blessings I have.  What does x amount of pounds really mean.  It does bother me to not be thin.  But why?  Unfortunately the society we live in makes it difficult to feel otherwise.But letting go of the rules and rituals and focus on food and numbers and for me, the identity that came with being underweight, again, for me, meant having to grow up and live in the real world and not hospitals or programs.  I was hospitalized so many times because of my fear of so much.  Facing reality.  Facing pain.  Facing responsibility.  Facing moving out of my parent's home at thirty something.   Scary stuff.  But I did it and have been for the most part in the past two years doing really well.  There have been set backs but I have actually found living outside of hospitals not so bad.  I have a life now.So I don't know for you, if you can identify what fears you have about ""doing well"".  What does that mean for you? You don't have to answer here.  You have probably explored this with your treatment team or therapist.  How is it going with your new therapist?  I know this was long and I apologize for that.  I just start typing and off  I go.   I hope that you can find freedom from this.  Step out of that bondage.  Into a freedom that is really quite nice.  Take care and know that I care.iwanttolive",hermione3,"Thu,04/30/2020-10:50am",Thank you for the support. It is going well with my new therapist I like her so far.

In the beginning, I wished for an ED so I could be skinnier. But then I started to get really tired, my hair fell out, my family was extremely concerned, I was always dizzy, I was always cold, and my heart rate was very low. But in my mind, I was never healthier. I don't think all those symptoms sound healthy! But then I remembered why I wanted to lose weight. I wanted to be healthier. And this was not the way to go about it. So just think of it like this, I am eating and I am taking supplements so I can be healthy!

I purged some blood up this morning twice.,_admin_moderator,"Mon,04/27/2020-9:15pm","Hi Tryingtoheal - we left a comment on your other post as well. Traces of blood in your vomit is a very concerning symptom. The following are just some of the signs of a serious problem that demands immediate medical attention: •accidentally or deliberately caused themselves a physical injury •become suicidal •confused thinking and is not making any sense •delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations (experiencing things that aren’t there) •disoriented; doesn’t know what day it is, where they are or who they are •vomiting several times a day or has uncontrollable vomiting or diarrhea •experiencing dizziness or fainting spells •too weak to walk or collapses •painful muscle spasms •complaining of chest pain or having trouble breathing •blood in their bowel movements, urine or vomit •a body mass index (BMI) of less than 16 •an irregular heartbeat, and fast heartbeat, or very low heart beat (less than 50 beats per minute) •cold or clammy skin indicating a low body temperature or has a body temperature of less than 35 degrees Celsius/95 degrees Fahrenheit.

448,04/28/2020,Weightgain,Smitty,"Hi all,
This is my first post. I'm only about 4 months into recovery. My ED consists of restriction and BDD. I am not allowed per my therapist to label foods as food and bad and count calories. While it does feel great to enjoy foods I feel I am gaining weight and I am terrified. I have never been ""underweight"" just on the low end of my BMI. But now with Corona virus, along with not being able to track calories I feel I have put on a few pounds. It's really hard to wrap my head around since I do still fit in my clothes they just fit differently. More snug. I saw a recent picture of myself and it was really triggering. I have thoughts about wanting to go back to counting calories and restricting food but I know I need to keep trucking along with therapy and that it's a process. My therapist assures me my weight gain is normal for my body to figure out it's ""normal"" plus I am finally allowing myself to eat foods I never ate before. I guess the part I'm really struggling with is, will I ever accept my body? I criticize my hips and stomach area sooo much and I'm curious to hear from people who have been farther along in recovery. ED's voice is still very loud in my head, and logically I know people don't view me as I view myself, I just am terrified I'm going to blow up, and not being able to really go anywhere with all this Covid19 is NOT helping my anxiety. Just looking for some insight from others. Thank you.",alwaysthinking,"Wed,04/29/2020-9:32pm","I've been in and out of recovery for probably 2 years or so. I've only had my eating disorder for 3 years, so it's not really much to say that.  I just know that my current therapist told me that body image is the last thing that anybody ever seems to accept. Or maybe it was someone in the hospital out of which I just was inpatient. Or maybe it was both of them. At any rate, body image is something with which we are all going to struggle. I don't know if everybody is always struggling with it. Maybe people who are farther along in recovery and who have been recovered for much longer don't deal with it anymore or not nearly as much. Myself, personally, I definitely still struggle with it. I just know that this is something totally normal, unfortunately. You're not alone at least. It's not the best club to which to belong, however. :-) hang in there, and I hope you keep posting. I wish you the best in recovery.",iwanttolive,"Wed,04/29/2020-9:48pm","Welcome to the forum. I am glad you have such a wise therapist. Counting, recording and measuring pare all ways to stay stuck in the eating disorder. I used to weigh myself umpteen times a day, never being satisfied with what I saw. I know what it feels like to have clothes not fit right.  I gave away all of my clothes that caused me to stress and want to go back to ""before"". I am mostly in recovery. I have accepted my weight, until my recent unneeded weight gain. But so many people are dealing with this not just those with eating disorders. So I am doing what I need to get back on track. I have accepted my weight but my body is another issue. It does get better. I never thought I would be able to eat anything I wanted even eating food prepared by someone else without asking with what it was made. I can eat at my Mom's without asking for special requests. So yes it can get easier. It takes time, for me trusting my Savior Jesus to help me and a lot of support. When things come up in therapy I may have a small setback.  Before it would cause me to wind up back in a hospital. I will end here. Just know you are not alone and that recovery is possible.
Take care,

449,04/29/2020,Notsure...iwanttolive,iwanttolive,"So I am not sure if I was going to post this but I guess I am.  My roommate has always been a bit challenging and in recent days we have been getting along...that is until tonight.  She really put me down in some big ways, deriding me and treating me with scorn and derision.  She does not like the fact that I speak with my parent's as I do, does not like that I went to live with them on several occasions, nor the fact that my parent's had us all meet to discuss some issues that needed some help resolving, mostly regarding my sister and myself but she was also involved to a point.  This was a year ago.  When Covid started, my mother asked me some questions regarding my roommates activities due to my sisters ill health.  She lambasted me tonight because when I told my mother that my roommate was going out shopping my Mom came over and talked with her and it was thrown in my face tonight.  She angrily spoke to me, TO me, and told me she didn't appreciate that at all.  No one is going to put their fear about the virus on her, not even my Mom.  My roommate does not like that I am as involved with my parent's and lets me know all the time saying I am not a child and shouldn't bother my parents as they have enough worries to deal with.  She said we are all adults here and should be able to deal with the problems at this house without them.  I told her that she does not understand the history with my sisters and the problems we have in working things out and sometimes I need them to help.  To which derision and hate came back at me.  My sister thou she be very sick can be very mean and aggressive.  My roommate only sees her as the victim and the sick one. She has no understanding of mental health problems and sees me as someone who needs to grow up and be ""normal"".  I said that I never had a family of my own and didn't learn a lot of certain things.  She can be so mean and awful.  Cruel.  I was slapped around good tonight.  She puts me down because I don't exercise, she does.  I do what I can and am working up to more, but the body pain I have from just working prevents me from doing more.  She chides the way I eat.  What I eat.  She does not know how to have a conversation that involves any type of constructive feedback.  She turns into this creature and it scares me.I understand she has a different relationship with her folks.  Fine.  But don't put me down for having had an eating disorder of for being on medication.  For having to have gone to a hospital.  For not being completely independent.   Right now I am so deflated.  All the air I had earlier is gone.  There is no standing up to her. No letting her know that she was being a bit rough.  She throws darts at me if I say anything like that to her.  But she is the one who says we should be able to work out our issues.  No we can not just like I can't with my sister.  I was going to but won't apologize for this post nor its length.  No one has to read it if it is too long or too whatever.",alwaysthinking,"Wed,04/29/2020-6:11pm","No apologies are necessary. I think you said exactly what needed to be said in order to explain the situation.   I am so sorry that you are having to deal with this ongoing situation. Is there any possibility of getting a different roommate? Obviously you can't get a different family, but is there any chance of changing roommates? How invested into this relationship is she and how invested into the living space is she?  She obviously doesn't seem to care anything about you, so is there any chance that she would be willing to look for another place to live, if you were to find someone more compatible for a roommate?  Someone who ""gets"" your situation and would treat you with respect and like a human being.  Just a thought. Again, I am sorry that you're having to deal with this on an ongoing basis.  And feel free to rant, Rave, and complain as much as you need. Since you obviously are not able to do that in your own home.  You're more than welcome to do it here, and I'll gladly listen respectfully and with sympathy/empathy.",iwanttolive,"Wed,04/29/2020-6:23pm",Hi. Unfortunately it isn't up to me.  She only pays $200.00 a month in rent so she isn't going anywhere as far as she is concerned.  My parent's say that we need someone over 55 to live here because it is a retirement home.  I cannot afford to move.  So we are stuck.  My parent's are not willing to change anything at this time or even in the past when my sister wasn't so sick and before COVID.  So I have to deal.  I just have to accept the fact that I am a terrible roommate.  I am selfish and think only of myself.  That is what I am told.  Why would they lie?  But thank you for your concern and questions.  I wish there were a way I could live by myself with my furbaby.

454,04/28/2020,Braveheart,iwanttolive,Hi.  I am just checking it to see how you are doing.  Thinking of you with warm thoughts.Your friend,tryingtobebrave,"Tue,04/28/2020-10:16pm","Thanks for checking in. I’m doing okay I guess. I’m finding my daily “routine”, most of which consists of different activities like reading, puzzles etc in bed (which I am embarrassed about being so incapacitated at 27) keeps my mind distracted but then the emotions come in heavy and I cry myself to sleep at night because there’s no distractions. I finally set an appnment with my therapist for Thursday. I avoided it because I don’t want to talk about or think about or discover my pain and grief. It’s easy to ignore it when our whole world is going through a collective trauma together. It makes it easy to have less room for grief, if this virus wasn’t happening, I would probably be very depressed and more over taken by my grief. I found a show that’s a comedy but very honest about a mans depression and grief. He says all his thoughts aloud to push people away and I find myself relating SO much to his thoughts, I just don’t voice them aloud as it’s not appropriate. But depression makes you think that way. Anyway, I like how it’s presented with humor and it’s hopeful to go on his journey with him through his grief even though it’s fiction. I’m ranting sorry! My cardiologist went well, he’s keeping my medication the same as my arrhythmia has been under control and unless I have issues I don’t have to go for two years!!! When I was a teen, and even early 20s I was in the ER so often bevsyee is my heart freaking out. This is the best it’s ever been. The only thing he said I need to do is get the surgery because ite not good for my body to be under so much stress from the pain.
I love you, Braveheart",iwanttolive,"Tue,04/28/2020-10:36pm","HI!!!!  That is such good news about your heart.  I am so happy.  I too, hope you can get the surgery ASAP.  I can not imagine living with such pain.  And being in bed and doing what you do is what you can do.  Please don't add guilt on top of all of the other emotional pain you are in.  And crying seems appropriate for what is going on. You lost two beautiful and treasured people in your life.  Safe people.  It is important to understand, we all need to understand this, and you even reminded me, that yes, COVID is happening and people are dying and the world is crazy right now, but that doesn't mean that all the other stuff stops.  Unfortunately elective surgeries have, but people still need to go to the doctors and that is almost impossible, but it doesn't mean we don't have things that need to be addressed.  My eye sight is getting worse but I can not get an appointment until June.  Does that mean my eyes don't need looked at?  No.  And your surgery, you need it, but it has been postponed.
So I am glad that you are going to talk with your therapist.  Did you see the support group I mentioned for alwaysthinking?  You might find it helpful.  I am going to join this coming Monday.  It should be good.  The therapist sounds really nice and we have exchanged emails a few times.I love you.  Going to stop here as it is long.

I pretty much just ate when I felt like it and often it has lead to overeating.  This week I found an amazing app, something I never do, and it helps me track my meals and emotions.  It tracks if one feels like restricting or binging or body checking.  It tailors the need of the person using the app to their individual circumstances.  It askes questions you want it to ask.  It also can link to a dietitian or therapists email or phone ( I think) phone.  I have found it very helpful in that it makes it easier to track emotions and eating, something my therapist asked me to do, keeping me from having to write it down which isn't easy.  It can remind me to eat or have a snack, or not.  I really like it. It helps monitor moods and all sorts of behaviors or feelings.  It offers encouraging words of support and you can even connect with others who want to do that.  I have often felt that I never needed to plan a snack as I was ""well"" enough to not have to need that. But I am finding that it actually really helps.  I also feel that I shouldn't eat two snack because I am wanting to lose a bit of weight.  But in the few days that I have done this, it has proven to be helpful.  The snack doesn't have to be large.  I always thought of a ""snack"" as being high in calories but that doesn't have to be the case.  It can be something small to keep the cravings down and to maintain blood sugar and prevent both undereating and overeating.I am so proud of myself.  I haven't really cooked in a while and I made a delicious meal even though I was by myself.  And even though I didn't get up until 1pm  redeemed the day and was proactive and accomplished a lot.Thanks for reading.  iwanttolive",tryingtobebrave,"Tue,04/28/2020-10:08pm","I’m proud of you! I’m so glad you found something that works for you. And you’re right; as I talked about with my dietian; having two snacks despite my weight actually keeps me from overeating and binging as much.

The prescribing Dr's these days, esp for patients on coverage plans for Medicare or other types like that prefer to send you out to a therapist than use up their shrinks for long sessions when they have therapists for that purpose.

I’m sorry you’re having to eat that food right now, but if it’s something you need, it’s something you need. I know I had a lot of things like that early on in recovery, especially during weight restoration. Sometimes, you just have to remember that it’s getting you to a better place and that it won’t be forever. Please don’t give up on that. Please don’t put your health at risk because of one thing. I know it may feel like too much, but I bet you’d amaze yourself with your strength and ability if you just gave it a try instead of always fighting it. You may not like it, but the more you learn to deal with it, the easier it and the recovery process will be. (That also means you’ll be able to let go of it faster too if you decide you really don’t like it!) I know it’s all way easier said than done, but try to trust the process. Our EDs love to tell us lies and convince us that they know better. That’s why we have to make nutrition plans with others for a while until we can make decisions outside the ED. It sounds like you’re making progress there too. I think it’s wonderful you found something you like. As you get farther along, I hope you will be able to have more times like that.

459,04/27/2020,MissingmyED,FearfullyMade,"I'm a teacher that misses going to school most of the days, living with my wonderful family and my grandmother.
The last couple months I've become aware of my weight/ body. And at first I was able to keep busy and ignore it.
However, being stuck inside the last few weeks has been increasingly difficult. My first time around with ED
there were feelings of self-hatred, sadness, anxiety, etc. However, since staying at home has given me a lot more time...i've
used that time studying my faith. So...most of the self-hatred is gone. I am still stuck with a lot of the anxiety, sadness and
worry as before. I find myself missing my ED and missing those unhealthy habits. Even at my smallest (which I never felt was small enough) I constantly thought of how to get smaller. I fear that weight will get in the way of the progression of my life.
People expect a certain look of a teacher (we all know the stereotype) and I'm turning 27 soon and have yet to find someone.
I just feel sad all the time lately because I feel like there's nothing I can do because as much as those bad habits worked ""worked"" I was always on edge before and constantly thought about food and exercise. Last summer I got a trainer. Such a bad call.
I'm wondering if anyone else has felt this way and what they did about it.
Or hoping for some good advice because at the end of it I recognize I have a good life but I just can't stop thinking about this.",alwaysthinking,"Mon,04/27/2020-9:07pm","I so hear you. Yes, I totally thought about exercise all the time and I felt that my life was working because I was either completely consumed in my spirituality or in my exercise and who needed anything else?  Who needed food either? Of course, I wasn't really happy. But also I didn't have to worry about being around the people who were hurting me either.  And also I wasn't doing anything else. Like living. Like having any fun whatsoever. Yes doing all of my spiritual activities has always brought me great joy. And I also never had any balance. So I totally hear you. And just tonight. I was feeling like I missed that though. Like why do I need anything other than just exercise and my spiritual life?  Who cares about Recreation and fun? I'd rather be thin again. And then I realized that was just all the voices that my father stuck in my head. And so I forced myself to have the evening snack that I am supposed to have. And I still feel miserable. So I don't really have a lot of advice, other than keep pushing forward and show that e.d. voice that it doesn't get to control you.  But does it make me feel any better? At the moment, no.

462,04/25/2020,upfromunder,iwanttolive,"Hi forum family,I just want to say that I am coming up from under the onslaught of negative thoughts and urges.  I have asked for support to deal with the overeating and have been honest with God and a friend and my therapist and doctor about the urges to self harm.  I used DBT skills and prayer and knowing that these things will never solve my problems.  Relationship does.  Family does.  Not only blood family but the family of God.  I am not saying that the eating is 100% better.  That I love my body at this size.  But I am saying that I am using a very powerful word, NO.  It is an important word in many ways.  YES is also a powerful word.  Two very small words with a lot of power.  I am thankful for these words and being able to apply them in my life.  Yes to life, no to death.  ""I will not die but live and declare the works of The Lord"".  Psalm 118:17.  This is my life verse and I intend to embrace it.Thank you for ""listening"".iwanttolive",_admin_moderator,"Mon,04/27/2020-12:17am","Dear iwanttolive – we want to make sure to post resources since you mentioned some concerning feelings.

463,04/26/2020,eatingbyfaith,iwanttolive,"Hi.  I am really excited and thankful.  After seeing NEDA put our the COVID help giving support groups that are available I finally took a look and found this group that starts tomorrow, Monday.  It is free and faith based which is perfect for me.  I am very excited about this as I will be able to share my faith and how God helps me with my recovery.  I am doing okay but could use some support.  I am amazed at how God is meeting my needs.  I started back to work last week and visited a former client today and had so much fun.  I gave her a foot bath using an electric machine.  I put in only a tiny amount of liquid body wash and for twenty minutes we both laughed and laughed as the bubbles grew and grew and didn't stop no matter how many times I pulled them away.  Such fun.  I will probably start back with her one day a week.SO that is my good news.  Also keeping a food journal has me aware that I am not overeating/binging as much as I thought I was.  Another good thing.I hope you all had a good weekend.  Take careiwanttolive",tryingtobebrave,"Sun,04/26/2020-10:16pm","I’m really glad you found a group that’s such a good fit!! And it sounds like you had some healing laughter today :)I found the same thing with feeling like I was overeating but realizing I’m actually not. Our brains try to play tricks on us sometimes, be we use skills such as journaling and are able to see things more clearly.
Love, Braveheart",iwanttolive,"Sun,04/26/2020-10:30pm","Oh it was such fun after being cooped up for so long.  I was there way longer that expected but I just couldn't leave. She has a chiowow not the correct spelling by any means!! She is smaller than my dog but weighs about the same.  My dog I can scoop her up in one arm but she isn't small enough that I hurt her too much if she gets underfoot.  The other dog is tinier and can get hurt more easily but is stockier.  So the two of them had at it with each other.  Her dog thought she could take my dog down but she didn't know that my dog always is BOSS.  So it was fun watching them interact.  Kinda like me and my sister at times!!!)))  One thinks the other is an easy take out but when push comes to shove, not literally, we both back down.  Not my Marci.  She is BOSS DOG.  As far as my friend, for that is what she has become, we certainly had fun.  I am going to be put back on her caseload tomorrow most likely even though it puts me over the hours I want to work. It won't be work though.  If you know what I mean.How are you?  I think that by writing down what I am eating it is helping me to not overeat.  There are times I am definitely over doing it.  I had to ask my father to not bring over junk from the food pantry no matter how much I beg him.  I took a bag of something from his car and then had to call him to tell him I stole from him.  That is what it was.  He said I shouldn't have done that, it wasn't mine. I said I KNOWWWWWWWWW>  that is why I am asking you to forgive me and I didn't have to tell you but I did and I am sorry.  He forgave me.  I felt really bad but I am better now and it is forgiven.   I am doing much better since starting the new medication.  I am going to call the pharmacist and ask if a med can work that quickly, it has only been three days.  Anyway, glad you can see that you are not overeating.  I am sorry that you are so uncomfortable in your body.  It must be very difficult not to be able to move around without pain.  I thank God that my pain has gotten better this past week or two.  A true miracle.  Love chatting with you, friend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
464,04/25/2020,Nervous,Tryingtoheal,im really nervous about treatment.  I don't want to eat.,iwanttolive,"Sat,04/25/2020-1:10am","Hi.  I understand your fears and they are valid.  While in treatment, you will have nurses and techs who will be available to work with you regarding these fears.  You will be with others who understand as well and you will be able to support each other.  What is important is that you get your body nourished and hopefully your thinking will be clearer and you will hopefully be able to understand that the food and weight gain isn't to harm you but to keep you alive.  And to learn why you started down this road of eating disordered eating.  There are reasons that it developed and this is one of the things that hopefully will be begun to be understood and then when you get out you can continue to figure out what purpose the eating disorder serves.  It always serves a purpose.  This doesn't mean we got sick on purpose or with intention.  No.  It means that we couldn't handle things that happened or that we are fearful and don't know how to cope with the fear.  That is part of recovery, just as much as the refeeeding or the regulation of eating as some have bulimia o binge eating and need to stabilize as much as someone who is underweight or average weight.I don't think I am making sense but it is normal to be afraid.  You won't be alone.  Staff there will help you.  Will it be easy?  Probably not and you may feel really uncomfortable for a while.  Just know that the weight that is gained is necessary.  It may not feel very comfortable at first.  You need to give yourself time to adjust to the change in weight.  I often say this is a journey, not a sprint.  I pray for you that God gives you His peace as you take this brave step to start saying yes to life again.  For me, the eating disorder was a way of saying no to life.  It was too scary and I needed to hide.  I don't know your story or what fears you face or what purpose the eating disorder serves for you.  Again, this is not saying blame or that you chose it.  It just happened that we fell into it I guess.  Now you will be given tools and learn new ways of coping without using food to cope, or numbers or fill in the blank.  This can be a great opportunity to learn about yourself, get support while getting to a healthier weight and then learning to use these skills once out.  I know I just said a lot and I hope I didn't confuse you too much.  You are brave and I am proud of you for taking this step.iwanttolive",Tryingtoheal,"Sat,04/25/2020-6:46pm",too much.,iwanttolive,"Sat,04/25/2020-7:20pm",Okay that being the case you will be taught how to deal with emotions and pain without using behaviors whatever they may be. You will learn what your body needs for nutrition and how to approach food from a healthier mindset. What do you want to get out of this hospital stay?  Thank you for responding to my long post,Tryingtoheal,"Sat,04/25/2020-8:26pm",it was too long.,iwanttolive,"Sat,04/25/2020-9:01pm",Hi.  I know it was long.  Maybe you can try it in  pieces?

465,04/25/2020,Braveheart,iwanttolive,"Hello friend,How are you?  Thinking of you and hoping you are okay.  I love you.",tryingtobebrave,"Sat,04/25/2020-10:36pm","Thanks for thinking of me. I’m doing the best I can. And right now that means that while I’m struggling emotionally and with grief, I’m not abusing my anxiety medication or self harm. I think the increase in my antidepressant is helping my ocd a bit as intrusive thoughts are less frequent. I had a moment of happiness earlier this evening, no particular reason, just lying on my bed after finding a comfortable position for my head and feeling the warmth of the sun coming through my window. I felt real hope. The happiness felt artificial if that makes sense, I know it’s from the medication but it’s better than always being so low.
I don’t know that I’m dealing with my grief . I’m kind of moving around it, blocking it out. I do feel a drastic change inside me since my grandpa died and I can’t understsnd it yet. I feel like if quarantine wasn’t happening, I would be going down a bad path. I can see it happening when it’s over; I will be so happy to see my two best friends but beyond that, the grief and the face pain will still be there and I will still spend most of my time at home due to pain. I briefly went for a drive with my mom last week and I hated being in the car. It hurts my face and neck so badly because my jaw position also strains my neck. Just regular driving in a car feels like whiplash. So I stay home. And I feel like being miserable from grief and pain while everything gets better would make me spiral right now and I also feel selfish and guilty for feeling that way.
But as of being in the present, I too overeat some. My dietitian who I communicate with on email when I need support, told me that she would rather me have two snacks than one a day. I don’t move, the strain of pain on my body has halted my metabolism and I know I’m overweight. But my dietitian still encourages two snacks so it feels like overeating even though I’m not because I’m overweight. She said after my surgery and when I’m able to move around more normally my metabolism will get back on track and my weight will balance out.
I have an appointment over telemed with my cardiologist on Tuesday and I’m a bit nervous. I had to see his PA last year bc he had an emergency surgery. So this is the first he’ll hear of my eating disorder. I want to email my dietitian and ask her to talk to him about it beforehand. But also, even when I was obese from binge eating disorder when I was younger and depressed constantly and on too many meds, he never judged me or encouraged me with exercise or commented on my weight. Instead he helped me explore options for my mental health and was more concerned about how anxiety was affecting my heart as my arrhythmia hadn’t been under control well at the time. So I know he won’t judge about my weight at all. I’m afraid I will cry if I tell him about my grandpa dying and my grandma last year because he was her dr, saved her life and Put in her pacemaker when I was a teenager. So he knows her and telling him about their deaths will be emotional. But he’s supportive about all my health including mental. Truly the best doctor I’ve ever had. I’m ranting, I’m sorry. I love you.",iwanttolive,"Sat,04/25/2020-10:59pm","Hi.  He seems like a truly compassionate and caring person.  He just might cry too when you tell him.  I am glad you have him and I believe as well that he will only encourage you and not place any shame on you for struggling with eating disorder issues.  There is no shame.  We are our own worst enemies and shame ourselves more than others most of the time, I think.  Yes, there are those who don't understand, but they are the type of people who seem to have gone through life without enduring the types of things we have and they honestly can not relate at all until they too will have to deal with suffering and I don't wish that on anyone.  It helps me understand those who are critical of mental health issues.  I don't know if that made sense.  I am so sorry that you live with such severe and chronic pain.  I am glad you had a brief respite from it today.  Sleep sound and sweet dreams.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
466,04/25/2020,TrueBeauty-apoem,alwaysthinking,"If you look at the post, I just did entitled best group I had, you will get the basis for this poem and also understand the part that I cannot include.after I said my last negative line, I then wrote the following: NO!STOP!What Really is True Beauty?It just seeing beyond all those lies
Knowing that the Truth
Is there before my eyes.What Really is True Beauty?It is being true and real
It's about just being myself
And not worrying about if it's a big deal.What Really is True Beauty?It is Laughter amongst the Pain
It's crying; knowing there's Hope
It's Loving Rainbows and accepting rain.What Really Is True Beauty?It's hurting yet knowing it's okay
To learn new memories
Because I'll survive and get through the day.What Really Is True Beauty?It is when the truth I see
That anything people said I was
Truly has nothing to do with me.What Really Is True Beauty?I show my Love for everyone
Just like Jehovah told us to
In imitation of His Son.What Really Is True Beauty?I show I possess it every day
By being kind to one and all
In smiles, and in words I say.What Really Is True Beauty?It is when I show that my Heart
Truly reflects God's Beautiful Love
Yes, from that True Beauty, I will Never Part.{We are all beautiful, my friends.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

467,04/25/2020,BestgroupIhad,alwaysthinking,"When I was in the inpatient facility, from which I just got discharged yesterday, one of the groups that we had for the e.d. patients was about Body image and how various components such as cultural socialization, interpersonal experiences, our own physical characteristics and changes, and our personality traits form how we feel about/see ourselves.  We then talked about how we each personally can see this, in our own lives and how these components molded our own body image.  The therapist then asked us to try to figure out which one of the components may have been the key to truly shaping our mindset.  Basically, she was asking what was truly at the bottom of all of it. It was actually the only group that I ever felt really helped me. And then later on in the day, I wrote a poem that was based on it. I cannot include all of it in here, because the first part is too personal and obviously it is based on how those four factors molded me.  It starts out very negatively. And I also know it can be very triggering. But I am going to include the part that was my intent, from the very beginning.  But since this post is already very long, and I want people to get the gist of it, I'm going to post it under another topic.",iwanttolive,"Sat,04/25/2020-10:07pm",Hi  I am looking forward to hearing what you wrote.

468,04/24/2020,iFast2eat,iwanttolive,Hi.  I am not going into a hospital.  I was in in November.  I have returned to work this past Wednesday.  I work with senior citizens as a home health aide.  I started keeping a food journal yesterday.  My parent's live three houses away and my sister is staying with them for the foreseeable future.I do not plan on taking any more classes because of my memory issues.  Thanks for checking in. How are you doing?,2Healthy4me,"Sat,04/25/2020-4:00pm","Especially when it comes to responding to others about ED Recovery. What issues do you have w/ your memory. I thought last I heard from reading your entries, that you were dedicated to school and had done a really good job the 1st time you had taken a class on Addictions. I hope you are able to heal and meet the goals you had set for yourself and your future. Is the 1 sister your only sibling? She is taken care of by your parents. It sounds like she is very sensitive to many different health issues. You sound like you are Army Strong Girl. Stay strong, you have your entire future ahead of you.",iwanttolive,"Sat,04/25/2020-4:33pm","Hi Ifast2eat.  I just woke up from a nap and saw your post. Yes, I have experienced a lot and have been in therapy forever, so God has given me a gift of understanding and being able to help others.  It also helps me when I post or respond to others, kinda like preaching to the choir.I had hopes of being able to get some sort of certification in peer counseling, but that isn't offered anymore.  It may be available at another college but not my local one.  I have serious memory issues that stem partially from my brain not developing properly.  I  have what is know as ""face blindness"" which makes it vert difficult to remember people and or what they look like. I often do not recognize people I have known for a long time or their names.  It takes me a very long time to remember people say at church.  Or if I see someone at the store, I may not recognize them or their name. I a lot of times pretend I know who I am talking to because I am embarrassed that I do not remember them but in the last year or so I am more open about it and tell people, especially new people, about my problem and if they could tell me who they are and where I know them from it would be helpful.  I also have a problem with directions and getting lost even in my own area of where I live.  I need my GPS and even with that it sometimes takes a year to learn a simple route going to my clients house several times a week.It interferes with reading and remembering characters or sequences in events.  When watching a movie I have difficulty remembering characters and may not be able to recognize certain people from one scene to the next.So that is a brief understanding about the memory. Even here I forget what someone is going through and rely on rereading some of the posts to get peoples stories right.I would not do well if I had to work in a psych hospital because I wouldn't be able to remember the residents or when doing notes on people who each person was and what happened in the day.  I would like to do that kind of work because I love people and helping but I will stick with working one on one with the seniors.  I love that.As for my sister, yes.  She has serious medical issues and is currently suffering a lot.  She is with my parent's both of them being nurses though retired.  Once a nurse, always a nurse.  I have four sisters.  Yes, four, with one we adopted although not legally, she is considered daughter number six and sister number five.  We are all close in age but separated by pain.I fight.  I refuse to allow the enemy take me down.  I have been dealing with urges to self harm but do not want to go down that road again.  I was on it for far too long.  And I am getting help and support for the overeating/binging.  The eating disorder I lived with for thirty years was serious and severe.  I now struggle with remnants of it and it still seems that it is strong at times but my therapist is helping me understand that will all that is going on right now in my family and with this Covid thing that slipping in this area is understandable.  For me it is understandable but I am fighting it and getting support and help and doing all I can do to not allow it come back.  I have come too far to go back.  So I soldier on.  I say we get that recovery muscle strong, that we are in this together and that we are warriors.That was a long answer.  Sorry.  I hope you are doing okay.   How are you?  Thank you for checking in and asking me questions.  Feel free to ask anything.With love,

470,04/24/2020,PostwritteninJanuary,iwanttolive,"Hi.  I wrote this in my prayer journal in January, the last time I was in my journal.  I am changing that as I am having difficulties concentrating so I will be journaling again.  So this is what I wrote in January that I think some of you might like.Today is the first day of the rest of our lives.  What if we started each day new-To see the frailties in the one who has hurt us or ignored us.  Or fill in the blank...I am learning that if I want to be accepted for being me, I need to offer that back to the other people in m
y life, especially those close to me.  I must accept their limitations and weaknesses and not expect them to be perfect, or as perfect as I would like them to be...So I can be happy.  Just maybe I need to offer grace instead of anger.
Acceptance of what is fact ahead of time if entering into a difficult conversation or dealing with a difficult person.  So here is what I liked so much about the post only rewritten in part here:These are for me to be practiced, to build up my recovery muscle.  It is made stronger when used.
It is through trials and difficulties in life that I or we, build the recovery muscle and this is part of the workout.  Learning.  Growing.  Changing...for now...I went on a bit but then came to this in my post or journal entry:  I am committed to recovery. I know I will get well and in doing so, serve others.  I do this now, but watch out when I don't have the extra baggage I have now.  I will probably always carry a purse of some kind, but not the baggage.  The suitcase will have to go and I will exchange it for a purse, more manageable, more doable, more reasonable.  Not expecting perfection nor an easy life, just different than it has been, so yes...iwanttoliveI hope some of you enjoyed this. I really like the analogy and can't believe I came up with it!!!  Going back over what we may have written is the byproduct of journaling.  I am also hoping to be able to pray more effectively and read my Bible and journal what I learn or hear from God.  It has helped in the past so I hope it helps now.Thank you for reading this. I wish you all a good night.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've gained a lot of weight in a very short time which the quarantine has contributed to very certainly and am starting to accept it but feel very guilty because it makes me feel like I had been pretending to everyone myself included I had a big problem because I wanted attention.,recoveryj,"Fri,04/24/2020-7:29am","Signs of success are NOT signs of pretending. The fact that you’re even worried about it makes it clear that you are not and never were faking anything. Feelings like you’re having show just how powerful ED is; it’s trying to suck you back in by telling you these lies. Don’t let it take control again. I’m so glad you’re taking steps to accept yourself just as you are. That’s amazing and takes so much courage and strength. Know that you are not alone. One of the most common lies ED tells is that “we’re not sick enough”. There is no such thing. You are worthy of life, happiness, and recovery, no matter where you’re at
Keep fighting,
Julesthefox",AndiTutti,"Fri,04/24/2020-8:02pm",That is exactly how I've been feeling! I'm so relieved to hear I am not the only one who feels like a fraud.

Lite exercise is always useful for me, daily. Also drink plenty of fluids, water is best. Call and schedule a med exam and see what other options are available for you. I saw a dietician in the past and the Dr. They also monitored my food plan.

474,04/24/2020,Stillthinkingaboutfoodconstantly?,ellaelise,"Hello, this is my first post on here. I have been maintaining a healthy weight for around 4 or 5 months now. I eat whenever I am hungry and don’t restrict any foods. However, I still find myself thinking about food all the time, such as planning meals for the future and counting up the calories of food I have eaten...

Crippling anxiety like that is so so hard. I skin pick with my anxiety and keep something in my hands to fidget or occupy them. Perhaps that is something you can try in regards to biting your nails? I know medication combination can be a bitter pill to swallow but God wants us to be safe and do what we must for our mental health. I had to increase a medication for my ocd and every time I have to adjust can be difficult, I struggle to sleep for the first week or so. Lack of sleep makes all mental issues worse too.

I simply hate having to take medication.  There is a Christian comedian who spoke of her psychiatric hospitalization and the fact that she takes medication for depression, not the only Christian in public that has shared something similar.  When she was done with one of her shows she was approached by a lady who was wearing glasses who told the comedian that she shouldn't talk about needing medication like she does. Chanda's response was classic, ""Drive home without those glasses"".  Meaning that if something is medically wrong or medication is needed for physical problems, there is no difference with brain illnesses.  I really liked her response.  I have been having mood swings and it was determined before but again this week that I have rapid cycling issues and therefore placed on a medication that I stopped for who knows why.  Side effects, a hospitalization where they changed things, I don't know.  I wanted to try to come off all my meds but that isn't going to happen in the foreseeable future.  My psychiatrist is very good and I am thankful to have him.How are YOU?????  I think of you  often and life you up in prayer.  How is the grief?  Have you dealt with it at all?  What about your surgery?  How has it been with your parent's?  Well, that is enough questions. Thank you for encouraging me.

478,04/20/2020,JustQuitTherapy,lateral_hypothalamus,"I was recently in a long-term over-control therapy for my ED, but I realize we NEVER talked about my ED. It made me feel more ashamed and secretive about the things I was thinking and feeling.I tried to divert my conversations/ skills over to my ED when with my therapist, but she always wanted to make it about situations where I ""could have communicated more clearly with other people"" or other, waaaaay more general over-control situations. Long story short, I quit therapy a few weeks ago, and now I am living in a super triggering environment and only have my virtual dietician to support. I feel like I'm emotionally draining to my boyfriend, but he's the only one I can talk to about this stuff. My family members know about my ED (they paid for my treatment last semester), but they no longer take it seriously. They skip meals all the time, restrict their own eating, etc and I'm just supposed to see that and continue eating my meal plan?!?! Makes no sense to me and makes me hurt and angry. I have tried talking to them about it, but they didn't get it and are still doing it.My dietician says to keep eating the meal plan (duh), but its a lot harder than shes making it out to be, and I need more emotional support or tangible advice on how to deal with this.Advice?",2Healthy4me,"Thu,04/23/2020-1:51am","Dont give up the boat for you are a valuable person and deserve to choose a new therapist.

I can identify with thoughts of wanting to sleep away the pain or the day or just make a few days disappear.

I do not want to take it but my problems are so complex that he said he doesn't think I will ever be on just one med.  That I need combinations.  I am not happy with this assessment.

481,03/31/2020,Firsttimepost..AmItechnicallyinrecovery?,Kaypa,"Hi.  I want to say, firstly, that I am so grateful for this community and this forum. I browsed through some of the posts/comments and saw such an amazing outpouring of love and support. Small little back story. I have struggled with an eating disorder for a very long time (too ashamed to say how long) and was finally diagnosed in Aug of 2018. I’ve been seeing a substance abuse therapist who also specializes in eating disorders (I have dual diagnosis’) over the past 6 weeks or so. I worked with her when I was still active in my substance abuse but we never really touched on the eating disorder. She tried many times but I would never let her in on that - it was too daunting of a task. Fast forward to today and we are no longer talking in depth about my substance abuse (which is fine because I have a sponsor for that) but have moved into addressing the ed. I trust her and because of that trust, I decided to follow through on her strong suggestion of adding an RDN to my team - about 4 weeks ago. My RDN is challenging me to a meal plan and also is starting to open up the discussion around thoughts surrounding recovery, food etc. I have really really tried to follow her plan and just can’t seem to do it. She has been very patient with me but in our session today, challenged me pretty intensely. I don’t know if I’m in “recovery” since I am not following her meal plan and also because I can’t seem to get on the same page. I do trust her and I intellectually know she is very good at her job ... but.... sigh. I understand (from what she is telling me) that my eating disorder is challenged and is doing every thing possible to keep its grips on me...but...sigh. I, of course, picked THIS time (of all times!) to start recovery - when there is a world pandemic happening. I’ve always had the best timing. ;) So..I guess my question is: am I technically in recovery just because I’m challenging my eating disorders thoughts/behaviors? Is it likely that she will give up on me..? Feeling very lost and overwhelmed and scared that I may not be able to do this. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Any feedback is warmly appreciated.",tryingtobebrave,"Tue,03/31/2020-1:17pm","Hi!! Welcome for the forum.
I would say, that if you have the intent of recovery and are trying your best, that you’re recovering/ in recovery/ working on recovery.
I too, am a recovering addict, along with having an eating disorder. My addiction was addressed several years before my eating disorder. With ED recovery, it’s never perfect and we all make mistakes and have slip ups. With my addiction, I personally couldn’t get back on track so easily with slipping, which is why I’ve been clean for five years. But with ED recovery, I’ve learned we have to allow ourselves more grace. A slip up in ED recovery doesn’t mean you’re back at day one. As long as you want to recovery and working at it, I would say you’re recovering. The beginning can be the hardest part. <3",Kaypa,"Wed,04/01/2020-12:11pm","Congratulations on 5 years sobriety!! I appreciate your feedback. I am working at it and feel like I’m not doing enough. I commit to my therapist and RDN to do what they suggest/offer for me and then I try to put it into action and I can’t bring myself to it. I guess if I continue to try, I’m not completely failing. I want to be perfect in recovery and I am learning (slowly..very slowly) that recovery looks different for every single person. “Courage doesn’t always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the night saying ‘I will try again tomorrow’”. -mary anne redmacher",tryingtobebrave,"Tue,03/31/2020-9:58pm","I love that quote, and what you said is true. I too am hard on myself about wanting the perfect recovery. I struggled a lot with that mentality at first because it’s different than substance abuse recovery you know? In ed recovery, slip ups are more common and expected, perfect recovery doesn’t apply here.
My grandmother passed away on Saturday, and I slipped into behaviors over the weekend. If it helps you to know at all, I’m not being as hard on myself about it as I used to be, and I’m able to get back on track with more ease. In the beginning, I slipped and stumbled and it took weeks to meet my treatment team’s expectations. Don’t give up. I know you can do this.",Kaypa,"Wed,04/01/2020-2:20am","I’m so sorry to hear of your grandma’s passing. My sincere condolences.

Congratulations on your sobriety you have overcome a difficult task already, remember that and know you can do this with your eating disorder as well. According to the DMS or diagnostic manual counselors there is something called partial remission and remissions both which have their own criteria of time length of absence of eating disorder symptoms. As many on here know eating disorders are considered a life long disorder, they take consistent work and attention to keep moving forward and not allowing ourselves to fall backwards. One of the best things to do to keep yourself moving forward is to use continued long term therapy and you are doing that. It sounds like you are still struggling with ED thoughts and actions but you're getting help which is a huge step in the right direction! Keep going!",Kaypa,"Wed,04/01/2020-11:55pm","Thank you for your response and the information about remission and partial remission. This is something I will explore with my therapist next week. Yes - still struggling. In fact, I attended my first EDA virtual meeting tonight and was somewhat triggered by the language and specificity of diagnosis’s/verbiage in the opening. I will also be speaking with my therapist and RD about this in our next sessions to discuss whether or not this is in line with their treatment plan. Thanks again for your response!

482,04/21/2020,Recovery-gastroparesis,Ellamaynesx,"ere, my name is Ellen and I am 20 years old. I had an eating disorder for a year whereby I was restricting and then decided to get help June 2019. I luckily had no mental issues with being a healthy weight, I was just stuck in a habit of not eating. Therefore, it was easier for me to go on a surplus and start eating again! Therefore, my increase in intake started and I was on a surplus everyday, making sure I got more than enough in even if I wasn’t hungry. Everything was going well and I was gaining weight without any issue or real severe symptoms that are worth noting. However it got to the end of October 2019. (I thought I had a lucky and easy escape) Then I started to experience a wide range of symptoms like acid reflux and have recently been told I have gastroparesis after a meal study. Which is probably due to having had an eating disorder. I couldn’t understand how my body escaped these symptoms when I was gaining weight and getting better In recovery over the 5 month period and then all of a sudden just came on me. Don’t get me wrong it was still hard, I still got slightly bloated and felt full regardless but nothing crazily severe like now! The fullness is literally like I am about to burst! I was able to eat a surplus without any real digestive issues for the first 5 months in recovery! These symptoms have caused my intake to decrease and I’m nervous as we speak because I’m not at a healthy weight anymore. I want to, but can barely eat. I genuinely am trying so so hard. I am constantly full, even with water my belly explodes and I have constant reflux. It is so easy for food and water to just come straight back up. I have never experienced such a horrible thing in my life I am always in pain and find it hard to do normal things. (The hardest part was trying to let my family know that this wasn’t me making this happen to myself and it wasn’t me choosing to have this - that something inside me just wasn’t right which thankfully has been diagnosed and I wasn’t brushed off by a doctor saying “it’s just her head, she has had a history of an eating disorder”) I’m just so nervous about my future and really hope that these symptoms because of my eating disorder don’t last forever and that I’m not always bursting full after a few spoonfuls of cereal???????? And as a result I get severe reflux because my stomach can’t cope with the capacity! I am only 20 and I am finding it so very tough. I just hope I’ll be able to go out to a restaurant one day with my friends again and choose whatever I want or have a pizza night. I can only pray this happens! I have read that achieving a healthy weight can resolve the gastric emptying but I’m confused how I was fine for 5 months in recovery? If you have any advice or any guidance please let me know I would be forever grateful!! Thank you so much because I am finding it hard to see light at the end of the tunnel with these physical complications further making it harder for me.",imstillgrowing,"Tue,04/21/2020-11:26pm","Hi! Okay, your post was a godsend to me... this could've been me writing it! I used to be very active on this forum but now only check from time to time. I posted asking if anyone had experience with gastroparesis like a month ago, and no one had personal experience. I am 23 and went to treatment last year from January-April. The first six weeks I was enjoying food (even though it did scare me), gaining weight healthily, and was finally excited about recovery. However, at six weeks I started getting insanely full very quickly and feeling extremely nauseous all the time. By April I started throwing up after meals. I went to a GI doctor and he brushed me off, knowing my history of an eating disorder. I knew about gastroparesis as I have some family members who have it so convinced him to get me tested, but the test came back negative! So I basically went through my life taking so many supplements and enduring the pain, afraid to complain because I didn't want anyone to think I was trying to go back to my eating disorder ways. But the pain and nausea was terrible and I finally got a GI doctor this past January who was experienced with eating disorders. He did an endoscopy and found the half-cup glass of water in my stomach that I had drank 6 hours before the procedure! He said that was a sure sign of gastroparesis and sometimes the barium tests aren't accurate the first time. Finally, I have some answers! But it is terrible. I want to enjoy food again, so bad. And I'm also so so sad that the eating disorder likely caused this... (I feel like it's my fault!) I've always had a slow gut and acid, but this is unlike anything I've experienced before. I don't know how much advice I have as I am in the same position... I want to be at a healthy weight again. I want to enjoy food again. My mind is in such a better place than it was before going to treatment but my body is revolting! I felt like recovery promised me so many things that it hasn't been able to fulfill because eating is painful and uncomfortable, and it's hard to keep food down :( I'm on a medicine to help my stomach empty faster which I think helps some, but not a lot. My GI doctor said the next step is to look into getting a gastric stimulator. I""m having a hard time finding the light at the end of the tunnel too... Maybe we can share with each other our wins and tips for making it through while we maneuver through this together! I'm so sorry you are dealing with this... it is so awful :( Prayers for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

488,04/20/2020,nighttime,iwanttolive,"Hi there.  I am up again, and it is after  midnight.  I find it very difficult to go to sleep and with the dyautonomia that I have, not being able to sleep is one of the symptoms.  I have a slight case of it, while my sister's life has been severely limited and she is mostly bed bound and or in the hospital because of it.  So I am thankful that I only have a mild case.  But being up late gives me time to worry and I have very bad anxiety.  It has been especially bad these past two days.  I have had to use prayer, DBT skills and distraction to deal with it.I know many people are dealing with anxiety and using food to cope even those who do not have eating disorders, during this Covid illness.  I live in New Jersey, the second hardest hit state in the US and the second hardest hit city in New Jersey.  There are over 4,000 deaths in New Jersey alone.  And tomorrow I am finally going back to work, but I work as a home health aide so there is a bit of a risk there but I know God has called me to work with the elderly and I want to be working now more than ever to be with one or two of them and try to help ease their loneliness and fears.  I had to wait until my sister was well enough and today is the day.  I still have to sleep but it is today even though it is still night.  So I just needed to get that off my mind.  Night time, eating late and weight gain.  UGh.  But if I put it in perspective with what I said about Covid, I could be dealing with a lot worse things.

489,04/20/2020,Urges,alyssa02,"I was wondering if anyone had insight into dealing with wanting to purge. I've been back in recovery for a few months now, but have just recently started getting these urges again. They seem to come out of the blue and all of a sudden it is all I can think about. I know this is part of the process, but I was wondering if anyone had any tips to help cope with these when they occur?",lateral_hypothalamus,"Mon,04/20/2020-4:26pm","Hello,
I have the same struggle- where I am suddenly getting purge urges again after months of progress. it SUCKS, but here is what has kept me from doing it...
Heres what I do:
1. Get OUT of the bathroom--> I don't want to set myself up for failure, so I remove myself from there temporarily so I can revisit in 5 mins
2. Set a timer for 5 minutes. For me this is all the time I need to do the rest of the list and come to a decision
3. Slow down my breathing, look at things that make me happy (pictures of my cats help)
4. (the hard part) start listing pros and consbasically, every time I do this, the pro is ""temporary emptiness and satisfaction"" and the cons are something along the lines of ""ruining your esophagus,"" ""puffy face,""""this is only a very small amount of food gone for a whole lot of pain,"" ""undoing all the progress I've made,"" ""setting myself up for relapse,"" ""starting a cycle that gets me out of control again,"" etc.So in the end... purging is never my logical conclusion. Give yourself 5 minutes to think it over. If by the end of it, you've convinced yourself that its worth it, by all means, the decision is ultimately yours. You have the power and control in the situation and for people like us, the strong thing to do is to take a step back and think about it. You are not in control or more powerful or more sick if you purge- the ED is controlling you and making you only reactive to emotion. hope this helps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

491,04/19/2020,Imadeamistake,Miggi,"So tonight my family was having dinner together, but I was making something separate. I usually only use half of X food to make it, but today I wasn't paying attention and I guess I just used all of it! Now I feel really guilty for eating a whole one because I know they have a lot of calories. I feel bad. I am still ruled by calories. Today in the store I couldn't decide what to get as a snack because it all had so many calories, I eventually settled with something lower calorie. Not only that, but my grandpa bought me the wrong kind of beverage, the kind he bought has x2 as many calories as the one I buy and I feel like just dumping it down the sink.

I didn't either, but i'm so so glad I did. The reason I tracked was for some control, so I thought that instead of counting calories I would just write down everything I ate. Which wasn't the best, but it was a step. Now I don't do either. first step is to stop counting calories. All you think about is the numbers, and as time goes on your ED will slowly decrease the amount it thinks you should have everyday. Until it's nothing, like in my case. I know it sounds really hard to do this, but if you wish to feel better you have to. It will seem impossible at first, but as time goes on you will be so glad you stopped counting.",Blue44,"Sun,04/19/2020-12:35pm",How are you doing today?

Maybe try asking someone to prepare a meal for you that you're comfortable with & that you don't know the calorie content? Or try to find a new food that you like without looking up the calories? Try to try to divert your thoughts making enjoyment of the food a higher priority than how many calories it might contain.

498,04/14/2020,honestrealization..anddifficult,hermione3,So I had a few conversations today with members of my treatment team about how I feel I can't be honest because I fear any slip up and my therapist will drop me. I realized I have to have an honest conversation with my therapist about how I feel I can't be honest with her which is a domino affect to being honest with the rest of my team. I am struggling right now but fear telling my therapist because I am on thin ice with her. I realized however I will not get better if I can't be honest with her and in turn the rest of my team it won't help me. She has helped me so much and it would destroy me to lose her but if I can't be honest with her it is not good for me and not helping the relationship. if she can't accept I will have any slip up and understanding maybe I need a different therapist if I am in this constant fear I feel I have to be perfect at recovery and it is making it harder. I am struggling a lot and I can't reach out for help because I am afraid my therapist will drop me. I am going to talk to her and this is not easy and if she thinks she can't work with me then I will need someone else I can be honest with as much as that would hurt me. I love her and our relationship but this is no way to be I can't not be honest with my whole team because I am in constant fear she will drop me. I think this is a huge realization and a lot of honesty on my part I don't have therapy until Friday but I am ready.,recoveryj,"Tue,04/14/2020-5:34pm","There is no shame in needing extra support. Maybe you could have more than one therapist on your team. I’m trying to do that now, as I have been really struggling too.

You are so brave for confronting this. I’m sure your therapist will appreciate your honesty about your fears. Then they will help you address that so you can continue to move forward.

499,04/07/2020,Weightrestoration,KateM04,"Hi... I guess weight gain is really scary for me, but I am trying to work on that. Aside from that can anyone give any guidance as to what really happens when you reach your body's set point weight? I know everyone is different but any guidance around this area of recovery would be helpful! I am worried that once I reach my set point weight while having all of my supplements, my weight will keep climbing up quickly. My family keeps saying that I am skinny but really when I look at myself I have a pregnant look stomach, which seems to permanently stick out. This is not the way I want to be, for once I just want to have a slim figure and I feel like I never going to be able to have that because I am literally being forced to eat 3 meals plus 3 snacks every day, with supplements that are high in calories.

504,04/14/2020,Weightgain,KateM04,"Hi, I am really conscious about gaining weight, which I know is something that I need to do in order to recover, but right now I am struggling with this. I have just started gaining weight really fast, and I am eating less than what I was at the beginning of recovery. I have been in recovery for about 2 and a half months. In the beginning to initially gained a bit of weight, which the doctor said was water weight, and then my weight gained plateaued for a while. Has anyone has similar experiences, does the weight gain slow down as you reach your bodies set point weight?",carmelfudge_f70,"Tue,04/14/2020-5:56pm","Hi. I'm no health expert so can't comment on what your weight's doing but understand how difficult & scary it is to gain a lot of weight really quickly. For me, it feels like some kind of cruel trick, like a bully trying to make my already difficult life even harder. Rubbing salt into the wound. Perhaps reflect upon the good things that come with having a healthy body, such as a better chance of fertility (if that's important to you) & having more energy. A healthy body is also more likely to live longer. Think of all the amazing things a fit & healthy body can do, such as run marathons, climb mountains & explore the world (I'm not sure if any of these appeal to you but I guess you'll have your own ideas of great achievements). Part of the mental recovery is realising that the ED's idea of the perfect body is unachievable so there's no point in paying it any attention at all. You could literally be a rotting skeleton & it won't be good enough for the ED! I hope this helps. x",march26,"Tue,04/14/2020-8:33pm","I'd also like to add about how much better I feel emotionally as I gain weight.

Honestly though, I think it was actually a blessing in disguise because it was like ripping off a band-aid- my absolute worst fear came true, and I just had to face it head on, because my only other option was staying sick. I've been at a healthy weight for about a year now, and I don't gain like that anymore... I can feel my body fighting to be at the weight it is. When I've made half-hearted attempts at weight loss my body really wasn't going for it, but it also hasn't gained in surprising ways the way it did when I first started gaining. Obviously though, everyone's body is different.
I urge you to hang in there though, because there's no way out than through this, even when it seems like other people's recoveries look a bit easier to handle lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know water weight can be frustrating but everyone’s bodies heal differently and adjust at different rates. Stay strong and keep up with the healthy movements. If you are really worried about the water weight I would recommend asking your doctor. They are a safe person to ask and may have some ideas as to what is causing water retention during recovery. xx,2Healthy4me,"Thu,04/16/2020-3:25pm","I had the same problem. The only thing that was useful for me was to join a gym, see a dietician weekly, swimming laps @ the local college pool, and eat what was recommended for me to eat.I felt sooo good working out, and still caring for myself that these activities became a healthy routine in my life. I am only walking for an hour nightly now as my gym closed down one summer, and now with to everything being closed down-i also can't swim laps currently. I look forward to getting back on my horse and riding but everything is on hold currently. Try and find some good things to due with your time and measure yourself less, or look in the mirror less.Oh female hormones also helped to balance my female system which also was causing me a ton of water retention. They put me on Yasmin and the water weight came off and that's when I was able to fit into my bathing suit so I could swim laps. I had Late Luteal Phase Disorder/PMS so that hormone balanced my system out just right...Try and keep busy, try positive thinking and healthy activities during these difficult times. In time, with body work, you should see big improvements. Drink more water daily too. And journaling about this process in recovery helped me a lot.

508,04/16/2020,RDN,Kaypa,"My RDN has suggested that I might be struggling with gastroparesis as we begin the, for lack of a better term, re-feeding process. I don’t know for sure if it’s technically “re-feeding” but essentially I’m learning how to eat x amount of meals and snacks per day to get my digestive system back in order. I did some research on it and it also lists diabetes being a possible cause which totally has me freaked out. I correlate diabetes with not good things and I’m disgusted with myself. She also mentioned that it is very common in eating disorder recovery to experience gastroparesis.
About a month ago, we started on a meal plan and I was experiencing extreme physical pain after meals or snacks. After our last session, in which she suggested this condition as a possibility, she sent me a revised meal plan. I don’t feel like I deserve to eat anything as I’ve already screwed my body up. What’s the point now? I fear that my body will never heal and that I’ll gain the weight.. that I’ll do all of this work and will never heal. I’m in a place of refusal and of extreme self doubt..more so than usual. I don’t know how to tell her this without pushing her away. Why would she continue to work with me if I am refusing? Sorry for the ramble. I found out on Monday and am just now starting to feel the feelings. I’ve been engaging in bx’s and not logging anything on recovery record. I don’t know if this is self sabotage or if this is just reality now. I hate myself for even thinking I was strong enough. Sorry for such a low post. Just where I am right now.

It’s something that’s been a huge influence on my eating disorder and other struggles in my life, and with the quarantine making it where I’m alone with my thoughts even more often, I keep looking back on moments where people have either judged me or may have had a negative or false perception of me. They are often related to my physical appearance and weight, but some are also moments where people have witnessed me make mistakes or me saying something that doesn’t reflect my best self. I look back on these and get genuine anxiety, even panic attacks. I’ve been in recovery for almost a year, but I still struggle with trying to improve on these obsessions and it causes me to go back into disordered behaviors.

I’m angry that my grandpa is gone. I’m angry that my loving, safe and nurturing made figure is dead and gone and their house is empty and I will never hold them again.
I am angry that he is gone, and my dad, who was abusive and generally not a kind person even aside his mental illness is here. I’m stuck with the wrong male figure.
And I am so ashamed. I know my dad had undiahnosed mental illness that made him rage. But it doesn’t change the affect it had and still has on me, whether I know that or not.
It doesn’t change that i resent he’s here and grandpa is
Gone.
And I’m ashamed for feeling that way. I think of my dad sitting in the living room oblivious to the fact I feel this way and I feel wracked with guilt. I don’t recognize myself right now.
I want to lose myself in my addiction and since that’s not an option with quarantine, which is probably the only thing keeping me sober... ED is still there. I want to binge and stuff down the grief but I am already disgusted with my weight and physically my body is too worn down from enduring extreme chronic pain every day as who knows when I will be able to have surgery due to this virus, my body is too worn down to compensate.
How backwards is that? Quarantine is the only thing keeping me sober, and chronic pain wearing down my body is the only thing keeping me from compensating from binging, and hating my body in turn prevents the binging.

My problem is that when I type on the screen when my hand passes over the keyboard it types out letters that I'm not touching. I have to try to figure that out. My friend's husband works with computers or did work with them all his life he'll help transfer material on my old computer that broke onto the new computer that should be arriving tomorrow hopefully.

So I try to tell you you all to be as honest as you can be with your therapist because I truly believe that's the best way to get well. So I had to do that today. It wasn't easy but I was able to tell my therapist some things that I have engaged in recently. It was very difficult but she was very good and asked me what was going on and said that this is a very stressful time for all of us and to try to  not be too hard on myself. I just don't like the way I'm handling things. My friend / sister has the virus and is getting sicker and I'm worried about her. My blood sister is fair.

Except to know that a number is not my worth, I am not what I weigh, I'm not a number.  Right now I need to focus on what's important and that's getting back to work helping my family and doing what I need to do to stay on track with God. Thank you for your support of me and allowing me to speak some of the things that I've learned into your lives.

524,04/13/2020,March26,iwanttolive,"Hi. It sounds like you are heading in the right direction. So often people dealing with eating disorders feel that it isn't as bad as we know it is. There is so much more to food and numbers with eating disorders, as I mentioned. Guilt is high on the list of emotions, especially when it comes to thinking we should be doing better than we are. I know that as Christians we feel guilt for not dealing better with our stress. We need to continue to lean into the arms  of our Savior. There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
I encourage you to let someone know about your struggles. Do you know what is holding you back, what you are afraid of in letting someone know?   I look forward to hearing from you soon. iwanttolive",march26,"Mon,04/13/2020-9:50am","Yea Ive been thinking about this a lot.
    I guess I've always been that darling child, who does her best to help the family, taking up responsibilities when needed. I've always also been just, perfect (not to sound... stuck up), I guess, being the perfectionist I am. And having an ED means I am not that way. And then the stigma mental disorders get, I don't want my parents to view me that way, like I am crazy. It's stupid, they'd probably be supportive, they love me but I feel so ashamed I guess..
     Just my reputation, I'm known for being good, good grades good athlete good well behaved child, everyone says i'm pretty and tall and fit and that has all just gotten to me... I want to stay that way. And yea having ED means I'm... not.
      thanks for listening, for taking time to ask about me. thanks a lot.",iwanttolive,"Mon,04/13/2020-11:35pm","Hi there, again. I understand what you are saying. I too, was the good little girl, always the teachers pet. But these characteristics are all too familiar for many of us who deal with eating disorders. So when we start struggling people don't know how to react. Just remember, struggling with mental health issues is just as real as a physical problem. There is a Christian comedian who dealt with depression and was hospitalized. More than one. After one of her shows someone came up to her and said she shouldn't talk about being on antidepressants. It didn't look good she said. The comedian's response was to tell the lady to take off her glasses and drive home. She was trying to make a point, taking the shame out of emotional struggles.
When I was deep in the illness my personality changed. I became angry ad depressed. I was deceptive when trust was and is very important to me. To lie and hide was so out of character for me. My parent's stuck with me and supported me even when I wasn't very nice. Today I am much better. A lot better. I am still dealing with some aspects of the eating disorder. Sometimes more than others. One thing I learned to not do is say "" my"" eating disorder, and therefore making it my identity. I am separate from what I struggling with. So I say ""it"" or ""the"" eating disorder. It may sound like symantics, but to me it is a powerful declaration that I am first God's
and He is my identity. I do admit what I struggle with.
Well, this is long. I hope it helps you some. For now.  iwanttolive",march26,"Tue,04/14/2020-12:11am","I feel touched. that has definitely inspired me to reach out, as I'm pretty sure everything I fear is all just in my head and not going to be true.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It talks about being yoked to Jesus. He carries the weight for us and we follow Him. He tells us to give our burdens to Him. I know this doesn't make the pain snap aeay, but makes it easier to bare. You are in my thoughts and prayers  Your friend",tryingtobebrave,"Mon,04/13/2020-10:29pm","Hi my friend. I read your update post and I’m glad to hear today was better. I have been praying for you.
I’m in the same headspace as you with have gained a lot of weight and I’m not comfortable in my body at all but I try to just focus on other things because their are too many other things to be concerned about.
I’m really struggling with wanting to use substances. I feel like the quarantine is the only reason I havent relapsed with my addiction. I think I’m going to start attending an online AA meeting because eventually the quarantine will end, but my grief and addiction will still be there and if I don’t get in the right mindset it will lead me nowhere good.
I want my sobriety but I don’t know how to carry my grief. There are moments when things are okay, but many more when I feel a loss inside my heart.
I had the most shameful thought today. Next month is mother’s day, then June is Father’s Day. And I felt that I resent Father’s Day so much because the wrong one is here. My papa who was my nurturing father figure is gone and I resent having to celebrate my actual/ birth father while feeling the grief and loss of the one who was my safe harbor.
I feel ashamed for feeling this way. I feel ashamed for giving voice to that feeling here.
I have appointments with my therapist and psychiatrist through telehealth on Thursday. I have a behavior I have to admit to her. Luckily, I can be honest with her and tell her if I’ve self harmed and she doesn’t send me to the hospital unless I’m a danger to my life.",iwanttolive,"Mon,04/13/2020-10:58pm","<p>Thank you for sharing in such a vulnerable way. I really understand what you are saying. Please try not to place blame it shame on yourself for having those thoughts. It makes perfect sense to me that you want your papa with you and resent your birth father. Your papa was a father to you. There is going to be an empty space as you just lost two very your main nurturers (is that a word?) have died. Your dad hurt you and continues to. It doesn't sound like there was any nurturing with him. As far as attending a 12 step, that sounds like a good idea. I never dealt with substance abuse but sitting in front of a refrigerator stuffing food in my mouth is a terrible way to deal with stress. I haven't done that in years. I want to numb out with meds but know that is a road I don't want to be on. Today I had to tell my therapist that I self harmed in a small area. I am angry with myself but she was great. Didn't threaten me with hospitalization. She is new so I didn't know how she would respond. I really hate this telli counselling. I cut my appointment short. So being honest is your best friend right now as you are very vulnerable. It is similar to having a burn and every time the burn is touched, even ever so softly it hurts really bad. You are burned right now, as I see it, and you need to take special care to prevent more damage. I hope that analogy makes sense. You are brave. You have so much going on and you still push forward. Taking the necessary steps to stay from sliding all the way down. You, I, may fall but we keep getting back up again. I am proud of you. In love you and want you to know that you inspire me. For now... iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

530,04/10/2020,Comparison,Spring17,"Hi everyone. I’ve recently felt I’ve started to relapse into on ED behaviors and sought out some online help, coming across this website. I’ve been recovering maybe close to 2 years now, and overall have maintained a healthier lifestyle. However, with quarantine happening I’ve really been struggling. I try and stay active and eat healthy, but due to sitting and working from home all day I feel bloated, disgusted and ashamed of myself. Additionally, I’ve picked up on learning a new language during my free time - which has been great and given me a distraction, but I think has also contributed to me feeling negatively towards my body. The language I’m trying to learn has people of a stereotypical small/petite weight and tend to be very thin and healthy. Personally, I’m very tall for a girl and have struggled with feeling “feminine” “small” and “dainty” most of my adult life. So while I’ve been happy learning this language and culture, I find myself comparing myself to the people in the videos and learning materials I’ve been using and wishing I was smaller like them. It makes me feel ugly, and the solitude and restriction of quarantine isn’t helping since I live alone and can’t go to the gym or at keep busy to distract myself. I feel almost silly for expressing this, as I tried sharing it with my family and they never seem to understand how I actually feel. I feel I’m crazy and stupid for comparing and thinking this way, because all nationalities and just people in general are born with different genes.. I just struggle to get past the idea of knowing I can never change the way I look to be “ideal” in my mind. I consistently think “ if I was just more dedicated” I would look that way, when that is not true nor healthy. Looking for some uplifting words from others who can relate and maybe some advice on how to get past this mindset.",alwaysthinking,"Mon,04/13/2020-7:08am","Is there any way you can continue learning the language without having any video material of them? I can understand the difficulty obviously of seeing people over and over again who look a certain way. And then you constantly are being barraged by seeing them. That totally makes sense. It would be as if you are in that world, And you are the lone person who doesn't look like them. I totally get it. It's like being the one person who completely stands out as completely different. I am so sorry that you are dealing with this. I encourage you to continue learning the language because I myself adore learning new languages and learning about new cultures. I would think that if you're learning it online, there should be a way to do it without having any video, along with it.  But yeah, it totally makes sense
how you feel.  It's kind of like in the movie Bride Wars, when Anne Hathaway's character got tricked by her best friend. And she ended up walking through New York City with  bright orange hair and skin. She stuck out like a sore thumb. So I can totally get your feeling of discomfort when you are viewing these videos. That if you are so much taller than those people you would feel like you stick out like a sore thumb. I'm not even going to comment on the other part because it really doesn't matter as I know you truly know. But I do sympathize with you because our eating disorder brains automatically go to that part as well. So, I'm here for you. And I'm sorry that you're dealing with this. And I'm sorry that your family doesn't get it. Hang in there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can't really tell you whether your stomach will become flat or not, because well, all our bodies are different so I'm not in a position where I can do that, but also because I think it would be a bit misguided since a big part of recovery is improving your trust in your body and gaining acceptance in your body changing. Do you have a dietitian? If you do and this is a genuine concern for you I'd ask them about it. However, in regards to the mental aspect of it, I feel like it's important to let your body change, even if it means sitting in discomfort sometimes, since it will more positively impact your recovery in the long run. Talking to a therapist or a loved one about your feelings and discomfort can help too. I hope this helps, I'm sorry if it isn't exactly the answer you were looking for.",KateM04,"Thu,04/09/2020-2:19am","Thanks for your reply! I do have a dietitian and I will bring it up for discussion next time I have an appointment.

   Um Im pretty sure im dealing with an ED, but i am honestly wayy too ashamed of it to tell my family, i am really young, so still relying on them a lot, can't really see a therapist without them knowing. ive lost a lot of my weight because of those thoughts that keep swirling in my head over the course of these two years. Recently I guess my schedule freed up and i started having to eat normally because I was eating with everyone else, so my parents started noticing how little i ate and forced me to eat more. i then experienced gastro-... idk stomach? issues and they took me to see so many stomach and digestion doctors.and recently from school (health class) i connect the dots and realize, i have an ED. and my parents have spent (wasted i feel) so much money on doctors and bills for my health when it was all self-inflicted... so im too afraid to tell them. just told my little brother today though, i feel he's less judgemental... sry its a bit very long, but through all of this im trying to rely on Christ more, like this will bring me closer to Him. Pastor said yesterday for Good Friday that trying to be a perfectionist, trying to have a perfect image (physical or emotional or achivements) are all basically saying that Jesus dying on the cross wasn't enough. praying ill be better in that area. thanks for your kindness in reaching out... ive thought of posting before but was way too afraid. :)",iwanttolive,"Sun,04/12/2020-7:21pm","Hi. I am really glad you reached out support. This is a supportive forum. Have your parents given you any indication that they would be upset if they knew of your struggles?  They probably have some idea that something is wrong. Also, not to scars you but eating disorders left untreated usually get worse. They are very difficult to overcome on one's body own. Even as Christian's we need support. I encourage you to see if you can tell your parents. There is  no shame in having emotional problems and an eating disorder usually indicates that you are hurting and don't know how to deal with your pain. They are much more than food and numbers. Please post as much as you need to. And if you can talk with your pastor that could be very helpful. What is the name of your church?  Well for now, take care and keep posting. iwanttolive.

I'm too afraid to send it though, and, like i said before, halfway through i felt like i was making everything up... but i saved the draft.

539,04/11/2020,Dissociation,tryingtobebrave,"So I have a dissociative disorder that I’ve learned how manage and cope with (aside from medication). Honestly I’m surprised this hasn’t affected me during self isolation sooner.
I made it over 30 days before my brain freaked out too much! But today’s it has started to do so. Basically a major symptom of my dissociative disorder, and the one I dislike most, is at times I feel like I can’t trust reality. I feel like I’m in a dream of hallucinating- which I’m not. But most of the day my brain has been convincing me I’m trapped in a dream- which just makes me panic more. Self isolation at this point is definitely triggering this. Luckily I have a telehealth appointment with my therapist and also one with my psychiatrist on Thursday.
Dissociation has surely kept me sane many times- but when it gets to derealization I hate it.
I just gotta keep reminding myself my brain is just trying to protect me and it assumes I’m trapped in a period of prolonged trauma even if I’m fine. If I can calm my anxiety it’ll start to back off.",hermione3,"Sat,04/11/2020-11:46pm",I don’t have much too say except I understand I have major issues with dissociation it’s a huge struggle.

540,04/08/2020,Poem,iwanttolive,"HANDS OFFDon't touch me there!
Hands off!
I got that scar, 10, 5, 15 years ago
And it reminds of everyday
To keep you and everyone else
Out of my lifeBut Jesus came
Bearing scars of His own,
And an invitation;
 ""Touch the nail prints,
Put your hand where the  blood flowed from My side.
Let My wounds give you freedom
To let yours go"".  ""You can trust Me with your  scars.
I  can't promise it won't hurt.
But I can promise you freedom
From the prison you have locked yourself in.
You thought it would keep you safe,
But it kept you wounded,
Alone in your painful memories."" "" May I, Yes?
I am peeling back the layers,
Uncovering disguised feelings,
Reactive behaviors,
Exposing the roots.
Scraping, cleaning,
Replenishing the soil,
Pouring in the oil,
The water of the Word,
The light of My presence. ""No longer are you defined by your scars!
You are safe in My arms,
Healed by My wounds.
And one day, like Me,
You will offer your scars

I know it is hard to feel like you do. I know it is so easy to feel like it is just better to give up. Especially when things are so difficult. But try to think of it this way, if someone who has cancer, keeps relapsing and keeps having problem after problem and would eventually go into remission, but then have another occurrence of the cancer again. Should that person feel like they are a failure? Should that person just give up on any chance of ever getting better? I know it is so difficult with mental disorders to try to think of it in that term. Especially since there are so many stigmas against mental disorders. But if people with cancer, diabetes, or any other physical disabilities Have the hope of getting better despite any relapses, struggles, or any problems that they have, then so do any of us with all of our problems.

With love, iwanttolive",tryingtobebrave,"Fri,04/10/2020-10:06pm","Hi my friend. Today was okay, weird. I was pretty dissociated most of the day. Grief is weird. I think this loss is worse because it feels like my tether to the safety and love I had is gone. I know they’re still with me, but it hurts so badly. It feels like road rash on my heart, is the only way I can explain it. I haven’t been abusing my anxiety medication, and I scheduled with my therapist for next week at least. I was able to have enough sense for a bit to do what I needed even if it’s not what I wanted. I’ve connected with an aunt and family friend I don’t know very well but who has been lending support from a distance which I appreciate. It keeps me from totally escaping to have people there, even if at a distance. My great aunt called my mom and they talked, and I didn’t realize she cared so much for me. Her son has a mental illness so she understands how i feel. Perhaps I’ve gained something. I just feel deep down sometimes still that I’m useless and assume not many people see anything worth loving on me, and it was a shock to realize otherwise.
But yeah its mostly Just dissociation. My papa and I both had the same stuffed animal donkey and I’ve been clinging to mine all the time.
I’m really exhausted. The pain is still there obviously and will be for the forseeable future. Sometimes it feels like my body is so exhausted from the pain that it’s just gonna quit. Sitting up wears me out, I do not feel as young as my age is at all. Anyway. I’ve been having thoughts about over eating which I’ve done a bit and also not eating at all.

First of all, let me just say how sorry I am with all of that you are dealing with. And secondly, even though I know it's not easy, try not to beat yourself up about how you are dealing with it.  We all deal with things in different ways. And we deal with them in different ways at different time periods as well. We may at one point in time  restrict in order to deal with some stressor. At another point in time, we may overeat to deal with a stressor. Another time we may simply isolate in order to deal with a stressor.  We never know what we may do in order to deal with stressors because stressors are just very frustrating in general.  We were not made to have to deal with stressors in the first place. That is not God's intention. That is Satan's. And you know that. But of course when we are dealing with stressors, that is very easy to forget that. And I am so sorry that you are having to deal with these things.

551,04/07/2020,Angry,tryingtobebrave,"My grief has taken on the form of anger today. Everything gets on my nerves. Having to take care of my hygiene, having to leave my bed, music which I normally love I can’t stand right now. I just can’t. It feels wrong. Here’s why my papa died: his former primary cares have kept him on oxygen and blood thinners for years and years because otherwise he gets clots. He is only stable on blood thinners and oxygen.
He gets a new primary care. The first time he sees this bleeping doctor, he decides he no longer needs oxygen and blood thinners because his tests are good.
READ HIS FREAKING HISTORY! He has only EVER been stable on those meds!!!!!!
And guess what happened??? Not a week later his lungs fill with blood clots and this time his body can’t fight them. He dies.
That doctor is partly (actually a LOT) responsible for his death. That doctor’s ignorance and not reading his records killed my grandpa.
And I am so angry about it I want to scream.
The family has a huge chance of a medical malpractice suit but we probably won’t pursue it because we’re too exhausted and just want to heal.I don’t like feeling this way, but I have a lot of anger and hate in my heart right now towards that doctor and I hope one day he will have to answer for his part in my grandpas death. Maybe without this he would have had a few months, a few years. He should not have died by a doctors severe negligence.",iwanttolive,"Tue,04/07/2020-10:45pm","H Braveheart, that would make me mad as well.  All's yourself to experience these emotions.

I have been in recovery for a little over 2 months and in my eyes I have gained a considerable amount of weight and I believe I am in a good place. I had an appointment with my dietian today, and they told me that I need to keep having all 3 of my supplements that I am meant to be having. I had an appointment with them 3 weeks ago, and they told me to add various things into my eating plan here and there, but I didn't do any of it because it really scared me what was going to happen to my body interms of weight gain if I did eat the extra food as well as the supplements, as my weight was already increasing without the extra food and I was feeling very uncomfortable even with the increase in weight with the original amount of food.
A couple of weeks ago, which was a week after the appointment I did my weekly weigh in at home and my weight had jumped up, which was really scary for me, and I felt like I couldn't bring myself to eating more food with this increase. I cut out all 3 of my supplements, but I followed my meal plan from when I weight myself till today. In those two weeks I felt happy and comfortable with what I was eating, and nothing seemed that bother me.
I am scared that my weight is going to jump up again, and I don't want to be big again, as that is something I am very insecure about. I just want to stay where I am where I am happy!
The dietitian also gave me a goal weight range today and it is not what I though it would be at all, and it is very close to the weight I was before I started restricting.This is triggering me to start restricting again, I don't know what to do. Even though my family say that I am skinny now, genuinely when I look at myself in the mirror I feel like I already am gaining weight!
Someone please help! I don't know what to do, I don't want to restrict again but I don't want to be the weight that the dietian thinks would be right for me, I am really self conscious now and get really anxious when I have my supplements because of fear of gaining weight. It like another 2 weeks before I see my dietian again, and nobody in my family seems to understand how hard it is for me to feel comfortable about gaining weight.
I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense and I kind of a ramble on... But I need some help, can anyone relate. I am really anxious and don't know what to do!

I think the reason why eating disorder developed is because I wanted control in a time in my life where there was no control, and I still feel that way. When I look at the scale and see the number go down I still feel proud and when I have to do my weigh ins it takes all the control away. It may sound like a good thing, but I am so anxious about it. And with my ED brain, I find myself trying to trick my support team that I weigh more than I do. Not only that but the weigh ins make me so embarrassed and ashamed. Its as if he asked me to strip. It is so hard on me. But I won't argue because my grandpa (who asked for the weigh ins.) took me in after my parents couldn't care for me.
I am also struggling with weight gain. A secret I have- I LOVE food. I like enjoying foods I used to restrict. But I am gaining weight, even though I’m not overeating or anything. And my stomach is no longer flat. I'm going through a tough time and now that i'm stuck at home its getting worse.

I look so short and fat next to her and there’s nowhere I can escape to. Sitting in the confines of the home I feel like a completely different person detached from reality outside. My usual trick when I’m feeling down is to read some body positivity blogs or look at some pictures of celebrities with similar bodies to mine, but then as soon as I look up and see myself next to her all my positive thoughts disappear.

I know that in reality being skinny wont make me happy but I dont know how to be happy with the body I have or make peace with food so i always end up convinced that if i magically lose weight or get skinny it will solve my issues and make me feel better about myself and I will be in control.

Coupled with the isolation due to this quarantine, I am really starting to get scared that I will start to cope with my old ED habits again. I do not want to relapse and this new guy that I am seeing does not know all the stress with my friends that is going on but I think I am going to talk to him about it tonight to try to see how he reacts. I just need some support right now and I do not want to lose everything and everyone that I have fought for. I do not really have anyone else to turn to. My mom is busy with my sisters and dad, and no one else in my family can really handle it. How do I keep myself from isolating and relapsing (again)? Advice?",AshleyNYC,"Fri,04/03/2020-2:59pm","Hi LittleFighter 77,

567,04/01/2020,Toomuch,tryingtobebrave,"My mood swings are insane right now. I was starting to feel more stable in the grief over losing my grandmother on Saturday.
But my mom talked to my aunt today, and my grandpa (papa) isn’t doing well. He’s tired, it’s almost been a year since my other grandmother died. His body is just tiring and it seems like he might not hang on much longer.
We haven’t visited him since last fall, I haven’t got to see him because my pain is uncontrollable without surgery and it’s too hard to travel. It makes me want to scream. It’s not that he’s the last grandparent I have, but I’m just as close to him as I was to the grandma I lost last year. They were my true home. My safe haven. No one hurt me when they were there. They loved me and I love them. I was happy with them. My papa is the only reason I grew up knowing a healthy example of a male in my life. We have a special connection and I cannot bear to lose it. Not now of all times. Not when I haven’t gotten to see him.
I felt so devastated after that phone call earlier today I almost had hysterical laughter because it just felt too incredulous that this is happening now.
I felt listless and selfish because my moms emotional state is too much for me to comfort her when I can’t stand this myself. I don’t want to talk about it with her. I want to hide in my bed and I know this is an awful thing to think, but I’m angry I can’t go out and drink because I want to so badly. I feel trapped and I want out. I want to run away from my life, from this, from the pain.",Kaypa,"Thu,04/02/2020-12:06am","Hi there dear one. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and fear and pain. I hear you and am here for you.
What you are going through is absolutely heartbreaking and I can totally relate (in my own way) to the grief you are feeling. In fact, I feel like you are sharing some of my story, too. My point is, you are not alone. It took courage to reach out here and to share your experiences  - keep coming back and sharing. Grief looks differently for everyone. If you need to scream, scream. If you need to cry, cry. If you need to laugh, laugh. If you need to talk, talk. If you need to sit in silence, sit in it. I wish there was a way for me to give you my number so that you could reach out via text. If that is not an option, I can link you to a few zoom meetings. I, in fact, chair one every Tuesday at Noon, my time, and would love for you to join. The thing is: you don’t have to go out and drink. Something that helps for me, when I am feeling the desire, is to “play the tape all the way through”. It never, ever, ever, ever ends well.Keep reaching out. Stay in your faith (whatever that may look like for you). If no one has told you today, I am here and I am listening.
Peace be with you. ~*~",alwaysthinking,"Thu,04/02/2020-4:31am","I am so sorry.  I was wondering how he might be doing, and if you were able to keep in touch with him.

I know I haven't been on in a while.  I finished the flag today!  A miracle as I am not crafty.  My Mom sewed it for me and my Dad made it even and I did the rest.My evening raids are less frequent.  My sister is not doing well.  She will be coming home but to my parent's house for the rest of her life.  That sounds awful to say.  The doctors say if she gets another infection and she very well may, her body won't be able to tolerate it.  She has been on five or more strong antibiotics IV and three at the same time and they finally got rid of the sepsis.  But with the central lines in her arms there is a high probability of infection. They had to take her port out as it was infected and they can not put another one back in.  That is how she gets her nutrition.  If she doesn't have that she will die.  If she does keep the lines in her arms she may get sick again.  She will be living with my parent's but my sister will be isolated for two weeks due to exposure at the hospital.  My sister/friend tested positive.  She seems to be doing okay.  I love what you said, Braveheart about us being family here. I am so sorry about your suffering.  The pain emotionally and physically.

569,04/01/2020,WorkingoutduringRecovery?,annem,"Hi! This is my first post and I am really hoping for some help!!I had an eating disorder from roughly August - January of this year. Not too long, considering. I lost some weight, but have gained it back. Just this past couple of weeks, my dietitian, doctor and I had decided it was okay for myself to workout again, at a slow pace.I have been doing a variety of exercises and I am eating (from what I remember from before the ED) plenty to support even more than what I am doing, but it feels like my body is super irritated. I am trying to eat a lot more too. But regardless I feel really really swollen, especially in my gut. I am drinking plenty of water as well. I guess I am just worried that I am backtracking and halting the progress that I have made. My doctor said I was not, but maybe to cut back on the exercises.Regardless of the amount of targeted workouts I have been doing. I only seem to be gaining weight in my stomach, which is starting the anxiety again and leading to thoughts of dieting and working out excessively. Which I immediately put a stop to. Does anyone have any advice or experience in this part of recovery and starting to workout again? I am very active generally and hate that the effort I put into working out is not creating any results.Does anyone have a similar experience, with a potentially shorter eating disorder and recovery time?",_admin_moderator,"Wed,04/01/2020-7:20pm","Hi annem.

Patient who are in partial remission are at greater risk of relapse then those who have achieved full remission, although all are at risk.

Those same patients were at elevated risk of relapse due to partial remission and evaluated over the next two and a half years.

572,03/30/2020,Feelingalone,koolkat07,"I feel so helpless. I had been doing really well for a couple of months now and hadn’t purged or binged at all. I’d been maintaining a healthy, balanced relationship with food and then all of a sudden when I went on spring break 3 weeks ago I just lost complete and total control of my eating. Day one I began binging every day like crazy, unable to stop myself. I began gaining weight extremely fast and my confidence has just been at its lowest it’s ever been at. I found myself going back to my old habits of over exercising for hours a day and even making myself throw up again to try and minimize the weight gain but my hinges have been SO overwhelming that no possible amount of damage control has been able to keep the weight off. Every day I have tried to show myself grace and keep a positive mindset of “tomorrow is a new day to make better choices” and then I wake up and binge again and the cycle repeats. It’s taking a HUGE toll on my mental health and I just feel so hopeless and like I just would rather die than continue destroying my body and my health every day. I’ve tried to be as open as possible with my therapist and with my mom about my episodes and feel like I’ve done everything possible to stop the binges (removing trigger foods, planning out meals, keeping a food/feelings diary, staying out of the kitchen) and NOTHING is working. It has never ever been this bad before and I have no idea what’s going on with me I feel like I’m going crazy and I feel so bad for my mom because she can’t even keep any food in the house because of her monster of a daughter who will devour every scrap of food before she can even get a chance to eat any of it. I’ve even caught her trying to HIDE food from me! How sad is that! I’m such a burden on her and I bet she’d be so much happier without me in her life. I just wish i was normal. I don’t know what to do anymore. No matter how much I seem to eat my brain screams at me to eat and eat and eat and it’s literally like a tunnel vision, lost time situation where I will just eat one simple thing and then it just is unstoppable and I don’t even know what I’m doing until I’ve eaten everything in the cabinets.

583,03/27/2020,mysister,iwanttolive,"Hi everyone.   I know most of us are at home or have some sort of restriction on our getting around.  I wish you peace and love.  To just do your best.  Try to find different things to do.  For me, it is making a flag that I am going to put in my front yard.  I am not a crafty person at all and don't really know what I am doing, but it has been fun.  This is an example of me trying something different while stuck at home.  My sister is critically ill  still and I just found out about the seriousness of her infection.  It has some weird wording and I don't quite understand it but she is on three strong antibiotics at the same time, as well as Theraflu and the Cornavirus malaria drugs.  We don't know for sure if she has it or not but since she is so sick the doctors put her on it.  At times anxiety will hit me, but I then try to turn my anxiety over to Jesus and ask for His help and peace.  It is very difficult.  She is already so ill to begin with, and her immune system is so poor that she has little left to fight this with.  She has been in a hospital for six months out of the past twelve, pretty much.  She has been living in her bed for that last two years.  Plus.  So my heart is sad, but I am trying to not let fear get the best of me.  Thanks for listening.

So I know he can help with that.  I have so much pain, especially at night so I am often up late and I just get up and go in the kitchen get some food, then climb back into bed and repeat this.  It has been going on for a while.  I know if I really tried more I could resist, but I don't.  I read, color, watch a program on my computer.

This helps keep my anxiety down but I have an anxiety disorder so that kinda confuses me.  But that is for another day.  Thanks again my friend.",alwaysthinking,"Fri,03/27/2020-10:36pm","First of all, I do want to say how sorry I am about everything with your sister and her health and also your pain and suffering. My heart breaks for you. I know that you are turning to God. And I know that that is the only thing that's going to get any of us through this. As far as activities that might be able to keep you from turning to the kitchen at night time, I have a few ideas. Simply because I dealt with this for a while myself.  When I was in college, I lived on campus for a while. And during that time I actually did not have a diagnosed eating disorder. I probably had a tendency toward  compulsive overeating however, So I kind of get it. At any rate, Sometimes the only thing that could help me  was doing either my meditations on my Bible passages, which I know should strike a chord with you, And the other thing that helped me as well  Was simply changing my scenery. Obviously with the restrictions that we are all facing at the moment, This is not as easy as getting out of the house and going for a walk somewhere like I had to do when I was in college. But since you live in a house, Are you  Able to go into a different room when the urge hits you?  And I don't mean the kitchen. :-) are you able simply to change your Venue, so to speak.  Sometimes it's just making the littlest changes and making the slightest things that we can control that will help us feel like we are in control, Rather than the eating disorder being in control. Another thought I had was if you feel up to doing some type of rearranging of furniture. And I don't mean massive moving of the bed, and such.  I know, of course with your back pain and things like that, that it is not possible. I posted under somebody else's post recently about  How when we feel like we are completely out of control, How if we do the slightest little things to take back that control, Then it slaps the eating disorder in the face. And then we feel that we are in control again. I hope this makes sense because I've had a really long day and I'm not really sure any of this makes sense anymore. :-) but anyway, what I have done in the past is rearrange things in my apartment because I have so many restrictions as to what I'm allowed to do with my apartment. And that makes me feel like I have control over things again. Even if it's simply rearranging where I have my paintings, then I feel like I am redecorating. Things like that. I know that you have said before that you don't do jigsaw puzzles, and I know you're not crafty, like you just said. So just anything that you can think of to keep yourself super occupied, but not so occupied that you feel like you're going to have to turn to food, in order to be able not to feel overwhelmed. I hope this helps. Again, like I said, my brain's really not thinking very clearly. Lots of love.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please know you are worth fighting for.  I know it is so difficult especially without support, but there is One Who never leaves your side.  Jesus is there and you can talk to Him all day long, asking for His help.  He will help you.  It may not seem like He is, but just keep trusting Him.As far as me being so strong, it is really my reliance on Jesus and learning, learning...to trust.  I just heard about a new diagnosis my sister has and it is dangerous.  Her life is already hanging in the balance, but with this now it is even more precarious.  My strength doesn't come from me, it comes from Jesus helping me, the really helpful people in my life and having Hope.  In the midst of severe back pain, two critically ill sisters and all this with the Coronavirus,  I am unable to do it by myself.  I have my times of really being afraid.  I have days where I am overeating.  When the thoughts of losing family to the virus are strong.  But...when I constantly am turning to Jesus He really does help me.Again, I am sorry you feel so desperate.  Is there anyone who you can turn to for support?  There are the support groups online that NEDA put on their website.  You don't have to live in a specific place to access the help right now I don't think. And most of them are free.

586,03/27/2020,Weightgainhelp,KateM04,"I have been recovering from an eating disorder for a little under 2 months, and I have gained more weight than I ever thought I would have to which is very triggering, daunting and scary for me. I was an outpatient and in the first couple of weeks of my recovery my weight jumped up by a large amount,which my doctor and dietian said is normal for such a dramatic increase in nutrition intake. After this my weight plateaued for the next little while and then over the past week it has suddenly jumped up a reasonable amount, I am kind of freaking out because I have had a pretty consistent nutrition intake for the past week. I am also meant to be taking 3 supplement drinks in addition to my regular eating to help restore my weight, but I have only being having a couple a day as I scared my weight is going to keep jumping up really fast (and I can't bring myself to drink the required amount of them when I know my weight has jumped up dramatically without changing my diet). I can't see my dietitian until next week, but this is all I am thinking about, I have been trying to let it go as I know I need to gain weight to recover, but this rapid increase really scared me and weight gain is a really hard thing for me as I was always considered the chubby kid, and I don't want to go back to what I used to look like. I am trying not to judge everything I eat, just because I know have gained weight, but it does scare me because I don't know why my weight has increased? My dietitian says that he will tell me what a goal weight range I should be aiming for, when he has discussed it with my pediatrician. This is so frustrating because I have no idea where I am headed! Does anyone have any advice or has a tone gone through the same thing? Does weight gain ever stop? Were you able to maintain a healthy/'set point weight' eating whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted after recovery?
Thanks",recoveryj,"Fri,03/27/2020-5:19pm","I definitely can relate to this. I understand the intense fear that comes with weight gain and feeling like it will never stop. Try to just breathe, trust the process. There’s a reason we have dietitians and meal plans - the better we follow the plan, the better our bodies trust us. And when they get to our unique set point, it will level off. Your body is just trying to get you to a point where you will be at your best. I know it’s hard, and it can be so scary to see jumps like that. But remember metabolism literally changes on a daily basis. Your body is making accommodations to make sure you get and then stay as healthy as you can be. The reasons for the supplements is also to help it get there. If you don’t get that nutrition, it’ll take your body a longer time to trust that it will get what it needs, so it will hold onto things longer. I’m so sorry it’s so overwhelming right now. Believe me, I understand. I remember crying on almost a daily basis for a while. It’s all so terrifying. But if you follow the meal plan, it will level off. And your body will reach its set point. And you will be healthy and strong. And you deserve that. You deserve recovery.

589,03/25/2020,Cananyonerelate?,tryingtobebrave,"My feelings about recovery vary so widely all depending on my mood. While I haven’t lapsed in a while, whenever depression or trauma symptoms kick in, I want so badly to run back into the eating disorder and behaviors. I want to lose myself in it and hide forever.
Fortunately, even during those times, the rational part of my brain remembers how agonizing recovery was at my lowest and I don’t want to go through that again.
When my mood is more stable, I’m glad for recovery. I hate how drastically my mood and feelings around recovery shift, even though I’m not acting on behaviors. I feel like there’s a storm raging inside me, wanting to drag me under and drown me, and it takes everything I have to fight it every day. Similar with my drug addiction. It’s so tempting to turn to destructive behaviors, and it’s frustrating that is something I constantly have to fight against. I have an appointment, hopefully telehealth because I have a weak immune system and getting a root canal finished on Monday was frightening with being so exposed. Anyway, last time we talked about increasing my antidepressant if my OCD symptoms weren’t subsiding, and I am nervous to do that and have to adjust while my dad is working from home.
I’m just tired of mental illness and chronic pain.
But I try every day to find SOMETHING positive.
Today, it’s that my mom and I have been getting along so well. Last weekend would have been my grandmothers birthday and we bonded through grief and healing. We work on puzzles together. Things like that make me want to keep going. Knowing when this is all over, I’ll get to see my best friend and give him a big hug. I check on him a lot because he’s 70 and at higher risk for being ill. We keep each other sane. It was like serendipity that formed our friendship, I would have never guessed he’d be my best friend.

592,03/23/2020,Support,tryingtobebrave,"I know for a lot of us, things are really hard right now.
Some of us have been doing fairly well but due to all that is happening right now are struggling.
My father is currently working from home, all three of us stuck together all the time. It feels triggering at times, reminding me of when I was trapped with his violence. It makes me want to binge eat, and the only thing stopping me is literally my jaw unable to open enough to do so. I almost don’t care, and would risk messing up my GI with being unable to digest properly as I can’t chew much. But then I don’t want to end up in the Er with an obstruction or other issues from it. Food was my one comfort and control when living in a violent home. I binged every day, multiple times a day, and became according to the BMI, very obese. I’m not there with my weight now, but I do struggle with the fact that I’m overweight. Usually I can be okay with my body but being ‘stuck’ at home with him, even though he’s no longer violent is triggering. He can be verbally abusive towards my mom because she won’t stand up to him, and she pretends like it’s not happening. To anyone stuck in an unsafe place during this time, I urge you to reach out and use crisis resources if you need to. Please know you’re not alone. Though I got out of my situation, I do know what it’s like to be trapped in that. Don’t let anyone shame you for being stuck; I know how that feels as well. I know sometimes it’s not safe to leave, or you’ve gotten Stockholm syndrome and feel you can’t. I just needed to say this as it’s something I’ve been thinking about with being triggered to my past.I do want to use food in various ways to control at times, but I remind myself the things that were ingrained in my mind were lies.

593,03/15/2020,Gastroparesis,imstillgrowing,"Have any of you developed gastroparesis during your eating disorder journey or your recovery journey? I think I've always had a ""slow gut"" but I started experiencing a lot of pain/discomfort/nausea/involuntary vomiting while restoring weight in treatment, and a year later and it hasn't really gotten better. It's just been confirmed that I have gastroparesis and my GI doctor said that can develop in the early stages of recovery (or during actively restricting). I'm sad, because I thought I wasn't going to have long term physical effects from the ED, and otherwise I""m very healthy now! But the constant pain and fullness is making it very hard to keep weight on. I'm still working with my dietician and she is fantastic, but I'm about at my wits end because of the pain and nausea! I'm not looking for medical advice, just looking to see if anyone else has or is experiencing this. And any non-medical advice you have would be awesome! :)
I've started taking a medicine again that I tried this time last year but didn't help much, but my GI said it could've been because I was taking another med at the time that can counteract the effects. This medicine can really help people but it can come with some adverse side effects. Hoping and praying it can help give me some relief. I really want to start enjoying eating again. Now my mind is in a better place and I don't want to actively engage in the eating disorder, but my gut isn't in a good place! Why can't my mind and body get along? Haha :) Blessings,

I am not saying this will happen to you, but even with the TPN feedings through a port in her neck she still feels the fullness.  She has many serious health issues so I can not say how much the gastroparesis is the cause of her pain and discomfort or all her other medical issues.I would definitely consult with your dietician and medical doctor, GI doc, and see what the recommend in terms of types of foods you could eat to minimize discomfort.

I feel as if I'm relapsing now because I've lost control.

My helplessness leads to me trying to gain control by reverting back to old, unhealthy habits. I feel so alone.",alwaysthinking,"Mon,03/23/2020-9:10pm","Is there a way you can find control in other healthier matters? Maybe you can try to control other things in your environment instead. For instance, one time when I was feeling very stuck and alone in my own apartment, I decided to redecorate the entire place again. Actually was more like just rearranging all the furniture, but to me it was like redecorating because I can't afford to truly redecorate. I also have entirely too many rules at the apartment where I live to do true redecorating. So they truly have all the control, but just that little piece of action in my part was my taking control over my little space of environment. So maybe you can find ways to take control over your environment. Make it personal. Whatever works best for you. Without it derailing your recovery. I know it's hard.

I also know you are struggling with eating and eating disorder issues and are really having a tough go of it.  How are you doing?,alwaysthinking,"Tue,03/24/2020-7:28am","Actually, we just got the order today. It starts tomorrow.  We've been allowed to go out, So far.  So it hasn't really affected me that much. But tomorrow it starts that were supposed to be on supposed lockdown. And it just starts tomorrow that my therapists are both doing  Telehealth where they are doing video conferencing so to speak, That is doing it over the camera on my phone. This should be interesting. Anyway, to get back onto the subject of my eating. It's been a rough go. I will have periods where I will be eating perfectly healthy. That is, according to my meal plan. And then I will get really frustrated or very upset and then find myself over eating on sweets. And what's so insane about it is that I don't even really want them and it makes me sick almost immediately. I don't really have that big of an appetite and I get full very quickly. I always have. I've never been able to eat much in a single sitting. And yet, when I overeat, I will be shoving food in, And let's make it clear, It's not a binge; And I don't really even want it. It's just like an emotional  reaction of some sort. And it only happens  like once  a week if that and then turns me into deciding that I'm not going to eat anything. For who-knows-how-long. And today is that day. So yesterday, I had that overeating of sweets at my  afternoon snack time, and it really wasn't that much of an overeating spree, When I really think back on it. But to me, it seemed like a huge amount. But now, I feel totally guilty and horrendous About it. And of course, I did not eat any supper  or my bedtime snack and I have not eaten anything yet today. And at this moment, I have no plans to eat ""ever again."" Of course, that happens quite often. So, who knows what will happen then? I just feel like a total disaster anymore. I'm so done with my body talks anymore.  I don't blame my body parts, and I don't blame anything from the past; I'm just back to blaming good old me. Because that's what always happened my entire life. I was always the one to blame. And I just can't get those messages out of my head. One of my therapists said it's more of a holding other people accountable Rather than blaming them. And I just can't figure out how to do that. So I'm back to Just blaming myself, Like they always did. I just feel like a total wreck. I don't know what to do anymore. Other than continue to pray like I always do.

604,03/20/2020,Reallystruggling,hermione3,I am struggling a lot... I don’t want to have to go back to treatment but my therapist said if I do not improve she wouldn’t hesitate to send me back. I don’t think this outbreak is helping and just my own self already struggling before it happened. I was cleaning out my closet at my parents house and there were a lot of clothes from when well when I was really sick... it was hard also my parents house is a trigger for trauma. She said eat for what you want like being a good friend and getting out of my job all sorts of things j want j can’t do if I go back to treatment... I just feel so awful,alwaysthinking,"Fri,03/20/2020-6:15pm","And coming from the standpoint of someone else who has had entirely too many traumatic things happen to her, i.e., me, It's okay. I have had occasions where I would be in and out of hospitals  every month. And all of this was because of my father's abuse. If this is what you need right now, then this is what you need. Think about it this way, and I'll use myself as an example.   For two years, when the trauma In my life was at probably its highest point, And things were absolutely awful in my life, I was in and out of the hospital every single month for those two years. I would be in the hospital for a couple of weeks, get out and go home and live with my parents. And then within a week or two, I'd be right back in another hospital. Of course, I didn't know about what was happening  During that period Of time, But I was quite aware of all my mental illnesses. And I was extremely suicidal. But now that I've been out of my parents house, and I have gone through all of those hospitalizations, I've lived a much Fuller life. I've only had two hospitalizations in a two-year period, And neither one of them lasted very long. And actually the last hospitalization was over 7 months ago. So even though in your head, it seems like an absolutely awful thing to have to go right back into the hospital right now, think of the bigger picture. This could possibly mean that in the future, You will have a much richer life, one that is filled with so many possibilities and far less hospitalizations if any. Even though none of us want to ever have to go into the hospital, with all of the things that we have all experienced, what we can do is continue to learn from them and grow from them. It's the best that we can do with what life has dealt us. It's really all we can do with it. It was not our fault What happened to us.  Now is your time to heal from it.  I know it's not easy. And we are always Our Own Worst Enemy. I had to be kind to myself today. And it definitely was not easy. I've been up since 12 midnight. We had the fire alarms going off and no one knew if it was real or not. And I was in my mama bear mode and doing everything I could to get all the residents out. We have over a hundred apartments in our complex. And we had the people on the handicap floor, the ones who are in wheelchairs, being stubborn idiots who would not leave. They were complaining that the fact that we were on a semi lockdown because of the coronavirus, that because they were not allowed to use the elevators, They couldn't get out. Because right now we are only allowed to go out the front door, which is on the ground floor and they are on the first floor. So my mama bear came out. I went over to the emergency exit door, And even though it was a little stubborn, I shoved that thing with all my might and I pushed that blasted thing open and the siren went off, But it was open! And I told those people get your butts outside. Because we didn't know whether or not it was real.  Anyway, the reason why I'm telling you all of this, is because since I have been up since 12, and it is now 6 p.m., I have been in hyper-vigilant mode all day,  And it has caused me to be in the weirdest mood ever, And as a result, I have eaten more than I ever have desired. Part of that has been because I had to drive to my therapist who is 2 hours away, And I was getting sleepy both going and coming, and I was afraid that if I did not eat, That was the only way that was going to keep me safe. Of course, I compensated for it,as well.  But both for the eating more than I desired and for the compensation, I told myself, I'm not going to beat myself up about it. I'm going to be kind to myself and say this is what I needed to do to get through today.   If people are going to be complete idiots and not get out, when there might be a fire that could kill them,  And I'm trying to shuttle out as many people as I can, then I'm going to eat whatever I need to, to feel better.  No, I'm not going to do this every day. Today was unique. At least I hope so. :)   but I say all of this because, Try to give yourself a break if possible. It's okay to be frustrated with yourself. And it's okay to recognize that this might be what you need at the moment. Just do what you can to take care of yourself. And if you can't take care of yourself, listen to your therapist and do what she says you need to be able to take care of yourself. And here's a lot more take care's -  I care about you, So please take care.",hermione3,"Fri,03/20/2020-9:57pm",Thanks for understanding and caring.

And then I felt like, no, it was my body parts that allowed it.  But, what I've been able to realize through therapy, is that I was powerless. And, If I had had any control over any of it, I wouldn't have  allowed any of it to happen. And I know it's much  Easier said than done, Because I still struggle with this frequently, But I'm sure you know, logically That changing how you look on the outside is not going to change anything about What happened in the past.  And I'm sure you know logically that that is not going to change your value. It's how God sees you that  Determines your true worth. And he really couldn't care less What any of us look like on the outside. Something we all need to remind ourselves of frequently. He sees who we truly are.

But then I have to change my thinking and turn to God and ask Him to help me.  I know it isn't easy.  I am in isolation and will be for a while as my sister has symptoms and is very sick.  I don't know if she will die from this or her other medical problems.  I do know that God knows.  This brings me peace, that even in these dark and scary times, I can turn to Him for peace.  He gives peace that passes understanding.  Peace that makes no sense.  I do get scared.  I do get stir crazy and the pain in my body is getting worse from inactivity.  But.  There is a bigger picture and for me, that is trusting God and allowing Him to help me through this time. That I can stay at home.  That my roommate and I can live together and love each other even though at times it is challenging.  But we do get along most of the time.  To look at the things we have, what we can do right now.  Changing our focus.  It is so important and can really help us all to be able to do the really difficult things we are being asked to do right now.  I love you fellow warriors.  As we continue to support one another, know that if you are struggling, there is no shame in that.  Let that struggle make you stronger.  Learn about yourself from the things you struggle with.  As I said before, a pearl is made when a grain of sand gets inside a clam or oyster, I am not sure which and the friction is what creates the beautiful pearl.  So see If you can allow this friction this scary time create in you something beautiful and wonderful.  You already are.  Just never give up.

614,03/21/2020,iwanttoliveandmysisterwhomayhavethevirus,iwanttolive,"Hi.  I am concerned about my sister.  She had to be discharged earlier than she should have been because of the virus.  Her doctors believed she was safer at home than at the hospital.  However, she has a fever, sore throat and a terrible cough.  Her immune system is terribly compromised, and I am concerned that she has the coronavirus.  My Mother has gone into her room, and will be coming over on a regular basis to set up my sisters feedings.
My mother is 78.  She should not be doing this.  But she says she is ""safe"".  There is nothing safe about her doing this, but there is no telling her otherwise.I know I am not to worry.  However, there is reason to have concern. I am quarantined due to exposure already and now I have to report to work, I am a home health aide, that I am still exposed to someone living with me.  They are aware of my sisters condition, but not her symptoms currently.Well, life goes on, even in quarantine.  My roommate usually wind up working things out or she just isn't aware of the hurt she causes or how mean she can be.  I only hope that she becomes more open to talking about when struggles occur.  I must be patient though.  And I will be.  I just need to not take it personally.Thank you for listening.iwanttoliveI emailed my Mom and Dad just now and called my sister who is a nurse in California.  She is speaking harshly with both my parents about their interaction with my sister and my mother will not be going back into her room, nor will I unless my sister becomes unable to get her feedings and hang them.  So I am so needing to cry right now but am okay.  Scared and so chock full of emotion.  On top of this I am still nauseous and feel so sick to my stomach.  My back is in severe pain and overall I am just very emotional.  I am okay though.  As long as my mother does not go into my sisters room I will be okay.  My sister may not survive this.",alwaysthinking,"Sun,03/22/2020-7:02am","There are not enough words to say  how to choked up I am about this.  My heart goes out to you my dear one. I'm so sorry.

WOW!!!)))))))))What can I say???  :)))As far as being cooped up and dealing with your dad, I am at my house, dealing with my roommate.  My sister is coming home early from the hospital today due to the virus spreading in the hospital and possibly getting the virus herself.  I have been self quarantined for about five days or so, but starting yesterday it is a mandatory quarantine as my friend who works at the hospital had a possible exposure and is herself on a mandatory two week.  Because I work in the health field, I am required to tell my agencies and then the mandatory.  So, it has been difficult.  It is only the beginning.  My roommate is nice most of the time, but if I ever ask her something, for instance, This morning she was banging the post and pans and slamming the cupboard doors and I didn't get to sleep until 3am.  She is usually quite noisy in the kitchen and my room is on the opposite side of the wall.  I asked her if she would please try to be quieter when she was cooking in the morning, something she does frequently, and that the cupboard doors slam shut so if she could please not let them fall closed but gently close them.  She turned into a lion. She gets this way.  She asked me if I was asking her to change how she was doing things for You? Meaning me.  I said I just want you to know it is loud and is waking me up.  She went on to say how she gets up earlier than I do and IS cooking for my friend.  So I left and went back to my room.  Half an hour later I came out and was going to ask her if I could ask her a question",Savedbygrace ,"Fri,03/20/2020-3:53pm",I'm so happy you're going to get your surgery.

I hope things improve soon.,iwanttolive,"Fri,03/20/2020-4:01pm","and decided to say I would like to say something.  I said you asked earlier if I was asking you to do something different because of me.  I said right then that Yes, I am asking that.  I said you may not be aware of the level of noise that you make when banging the post and the doors slamming closed, but I am letting you know so you are aware.  She became a different person.  Mean. Nasty.  I said, you are not being very nice.  Then she told me that I was not nice.  I took that to be a general statement.  She then said that I use the blender in the mornings to make my smoothie.   Irrelevant as she is up at this time.  I said yes, I make my smoothies.  She said she doesn't slam the doors, I said, but please close them so they don't close loudly.  She again was nasty and said I was imaging things when I told her she was laughing at me.  She basically thinks I am crazy.  Anytime I, which is rare, ask her to do something she doesn't like, she does this.
But, she can pick up my things, put them on my chair, tell me not to open the front door as it makes the furnace go on, she doesn't pay utilities, my Dad does.  I walk around feeling like a prisoner in my own house.  I am not the only one who sees this in her.  My other sister, not the one I live with, and a former roommate, see it.  She is a control freak.  I am nervous about my sister coming home.  I am going to have to keep my mouth shut about most things because she will find ways to fight with me.  As sick as she is.  Which is sad.  My sister in California is under a lot of stress.  She had to move out of her house to protect her husband and girls, he has a weak immune system.  She is a labor and delivery nurse.  She will only communicate with me through my Mom.  I don't even know what I did.  So, I am trying to stay strong.  I have to stay away from my Mom's and Dad's because of the virus.  The nurses at my job told me this, and my sister being exposed to who knows what at the hospital, it makes it even more so that I have to stay at my house.  I have my dog though.  And God.  And I can do things like walk by the brook in my back yard which I just did.  That was really nice.I am so happy for you and so sorry I ranted on about me and my silly stuff.  We are all going to have to support each other here as much as we can in the weeks ahead.  I love you and am delighted that you are going to have the surgery.  Now I have to start praying it is as painless as possible, less pain than you are having now.   iwanttolive",Savedbygrace ,"Fri,03/20/2020-4:30pm",How are you doing right now?

621,03/19/2020,Broken,tryingtobebrave,"I feel like I am truly at rock bottom right now. I am a complete wreck. I was holding up okay until I got the denial letter from the insurance in the mail. My dad once again went back on his word to help me, and my mom was telling me how I have to handle this myself. I went from fine to being close to crisis in so little time.
I tried to explain that it’s not that I WONT handle the hearing and legal part to get the surgery, I /can’t/. With my ptsd, this stress pushes me way over the edge and I CAN’T. I don’t know how to explain it any better but my mind just can’t tolerate it without pushing me into crisis.
So now I feel belittled and looked down on from both of them, I don’t know if he’ll help or not, and I feel completely hopeless. I texted my therapist and we made a telehealth session for tomorrow morning. I took my anxiety medication. I KNOW I did the right things in response to feeling a crisis possible coming on, but the interaction with my parents has made me feel completely out of control. It makes me feel crazy and worthless. I can’t stop crying, I feel so anxious and useless and I feel like a worthless waste of space when I can’t even handle dealing with the insurance anymore.

Thanks again for asking about me. Sorry my response is negative.",iwanttolive,"Thu,03/19/2020-2:44pm","Hi Blue44.  I just want to say that an honest answer to a caring question is not being negative.  It is being honest and the best way to get support.  That is what we are here for.  I am sorry you are struggling in dealing with your husband's stress and hating his job.  Have you any ideas on how to help yourself cope with the anxiety, that will work if you are home now with the virus?  Have you asked your husband what he needs from you during his stressful time?  I am sorry this makes you feel worthless.  You are a great support here on the forum and help a lot of people, so to me, that shows me in one small way that you are not worthless.  You are of great value in God's eyes.  He created you on purpose and for a reason.  Your worth is not in what you do or do not do, but in the fact that God loves you.You say you don't know how much longer you can live like this.  What do you mean?  How high is the stress level in your home?  Do you talk with each other? Share in each others company?  What is making living like you are so unbearable?  I ask not to pry but to see if you might be able to figure out for yourself what is going on and then maybe not be so desperate, so don't feel that you have to answer here on the forum.  Just something to think about.  If you don't talk much, maybe you could play a card game together or do something that isn't talking about ""stuff"" but just being together on neutral ground. My parent's play cards every night.  Well, keep posting and get support for yourself as you so often give it out.iwanttolive",Blue44,"Thu,03/19/2020-4:07pm",I appreciate your kind words.

She is giving me a limited number of pills at a time. When I said I don’t know how much longer I can live like this I didn’t mean divorce. I don’t believe that is what God wants.

624,03/16/2020,Coronovirus,iwanttolive,"Hi everyone.   I just really feel that I want to post and say that I am sure many of you are worried and don't understand what is going on right now.  Some are forced into quarantine as I am and some of you may know of someone who is affected by the virus.  Many places are shut down, we have a curfew  starting at 8pm until 5am not enforceable at this point by highly recommended.  Places of worship are not holding their meetings.  Most of you know all of this.  The purpose of my writing this is to encourage you.  One thing fear does is feed on itself.  The more we feed the fear, the bigger it gets.  I urge  those who are troubled and worried to try not to watch the news a lot.  To try to find puzzles and or word games  or color.  You may want to  talk to Jesus.  Jesus tells us that you can cast all our fears and worries, or give them to Him by talking to Him and letting Him know how you are feeling, for He cares for you...1  Peter 5:7.I know not all of you are follow a certain faith.  I as many of you know am a Christian and know that I NEED to place my trust in God during this time.  If not I will and have been anxious.  There is much going on with my family now as well.  I can CHOOSE to worry, or CHOOSE to turn to Jesus and ask Him to help me when the anxious thoughts come.  I invite you to do the same.  Let us support one another during this time and know that worry will only make things worse for us.  Thank you for reading this and I hope you are all doing okay.iwanttolive",Blue44,"Tue,03/17/2020-7:50pm",I appreciate you taking time to write this post.

Yes, we all want things to get back to ""normal"" but perhaps the normal we have been living isn't all that we should return to.  Not all, but some.

Maybe not this way, but when things go back, let's hope that we remain a friendlier world.Keep up the Hope.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
625,03/17/2020,Troublewithcomparison,Potterhead4life,"I reached my weight goal! Yay! I’m finally starting to embrace it, although when I first found out, my ED started to at up and complicate things... Anyways, in the past few days I’ve had a lot of trouble with comparing myself to other people. Not only looks but also to how much they are eating and how much I’m eating. Sometimes I feel like I’m eating the same amount as a stereotypical grown man and am still hungry while other people are only getting through the beginning of the meal and are full. I mean I know I’m still growing but I’m unsure (or I guess my ED’s unsure) if I’m eating too much. Not to mention, I occasionally look at those clothing magazines and not really (but at the same time really) compare myself to all the models with their abs and pretty faces. Ugh!

Back before I went to treatment and I overdosed and my therapist called my mom and she told my therapist she didn’t want me to go to the hospital or get blood work because they might think i was suicidal which I was. I then got blood work that showed my kidneys starting to fail and has to be hospitalized anyway but my mom was not happy luckily it was reversed and I soon went residential after. Yet my therapist feels my mom likes to be the martyr about taking care of me and my dad maybe unconsciously but she does it. It’s the emotional abuse stuff with my parents that is tough like my other abuse i can like be like no I won’t see those abusers again my parents I just let keep controlling me and have charge over my life. My therapist also says she feels I hold on so tight to my eating disorder because it has always literally been the one thing I can control and still because they are still so involved.

And I really had been doing all of this ever since I was four because I loved helping people. I still do. And yet, my parents, specifically my mother, made it abundantly clear that I was not capable of living on my own, nor could I drive to  the big city  that was 30 miles away for my various appointments that I had because that would mean Interstate driving. So I had to rely on my father to get me to the appointments there. And he is absolutely the craziest driver I have ever had to experience riding with, And his driving always scares me to death. And yet my mother didn't want to drive me there herself. So, I lived with my parents until I was 41. Because they convinced me that I could not take care of myself. But they still basically hammered it into me that I had to take care of them and everybody else. Yeah, very confusing. And this is what my therapist at the time told me was codependency, emotional abuse, and the most toxic  Household he had ever seen. He also told me get out of that house as often as possible, and he really did  Encourage me to think very strongly about leaving. For good. And thankfully I finally did have the courage to get out.  Which definitely was my saving point because then I learned about all the real abuse that was going on. Which obviously I'm not supposed to get into in depth. I hope that alone is allowed to be said. So, I don't know if that gives you any insight into what you may need to do. I don't know how similar your situation may be.  I just know how frustrating it is to be an adult and to have a parent tell you that you are not able to take care of yourself, When I know that I am perfectly capable of doing so. So I feel for you and I hope that you are able to get some comfort from Knowing that you are not alone. Take care.",hermione3,"Sat,03/14/2020-12:59pm",Sorry to hear about your situation that sounds difficult.

634,03/16/2020,Denied,tryingtobebrave,"My appeal for surgery has been denied by the insurance. The next step is a hearing with the insurance after i consult a lawyer. My dad has promised to handle to lawyer for me and when he tried to go back on it today, I stood up to him. I told him he said he was going to do this one thing for me, so he’s going to do it, because I never ask anything from him. And it’s true. After all he did to me growing up, I never hold it over him. But I physically cannot fight this myself and I somehow found the courage to stand up to him.
Earlier today, I almost threw away five and a half years of sobriety from narcotics. I had leftover pain medication from my tooth abscess this weekend, and while my mom went to the store, I went in a frenzy searching for it after the insurance call telling me the surgery was denied. But gratefully, I didn’t find it. I suspect my mom disposed of it after I told her I didn’t need any more yesterday. It was just bad timing having it around when I got crushing news. All non emergent surgeries are being canceled here anyhow. The hospitals are too full.
Anyway. I don’t know what more to say, while I’m not okay, I don’t feel like I’m a danger to myself and that’s more than I expected. I mostly feel myself shutting down and going into survivor mode.

635,03/03/2020,Reallystrugglingtostaystrong,lostatsea,"It's been a while since I've posted here. I'm not sure where to turn to, since I hate relying on my best friend all of the time. Most people in my life (who know about my issues) don't understand it, and never know what to say or do. Which is understandable. I just don't know what to tell them because I myself am not sure. So I've pretty much stopped reaching out to everyone besides my best friend.Sort of tangent-ed there. Right now, I'm struggling with fighting my negative thoughts and falling back on my behaviors. I've done really well for the most part in distracting myself, loving myself, getting the nourishment my body needs, and not purging. The thoughts come and go in waves, and I want to fall back so badly even though I know it's not good for me. Can anyone else relate? I don't know why, but I can't help these thoughts and I try so hard to not let it control me. I almost want to give up. Some days I can't even stand looking at myself or looking at photos of me.One of my roommates has been saying some pretty triggering things lately and I don't know how to approach it. I'm too afraid to even confront it because I don't want to expose myself to her, if that makes sense. She doesn't know about my issues, and I think she's the type of person that asks questions. But I'm not sure. I don't want to make my issues known, even though the things she says sometimes really triggers me. She also bought a scale and put it in our bathroom and when I saw it, I literally felt my heart sink and instantly felt panic. I haven't stepped on a scale in so long and I've avoided it. Now that it's in our bathroom, I always look at it and am tempted to step on it again even though I know it'll really send me spiraling. Sorry, that was a lot. I've had a lot on my mind and haven't been able to really talk someone through it other than that one friend. I hope someone can relate and possibly give me some advice.

I have been there. Relapsing just after returning home from treatment is a horrible feeling.But remember that coming home, especially when you have been away for some time, is a real shock to your system. Given how stressful this time period is, it's not surprising that you are finding yourself wanting to lean on old behaviors to cope. I hope you will treat yourself with kindness.
The despair you are feeling is a common early recovery experience, and it will not last forever. The first few weeks after you return home from treatment are in my opinion the most difficult. Call a friend, take a walk, do anything to get out of your head whenever you start to beat yourself up. Focusing on self-hatred will only slow you down and make you miserable. You will probably have some slips along the way as you progress in your recovery journey. They are not wasted if you learn from them.

638,03/15/2020,Howtoeat?,Steff,"Hi everyone!
I've been doing well with my recovery for a few months but lately I was searching for a better and more intuitive style of eating.
For the last few years I've been maintaining pretty healthy diet and eating about X kcal a day. Lately I've came to the information that it's not enough for a woman and I should be eating at least X kcal. Even though my diet kept me satisfied I believed that because I still binge from time to time.
I have to mention that I don't starve myself and I eat every time I feel hungry. I am looking for a new way of eating because I am tired of controlling how much I eat and what time during the day. I'm also afraid that I may have slowed metabolism or even damaged.
I want to ask about your approach to eating during recovery. Do you give up all restrictions and eat whenever you want? Or maybe plan your meals and count calories?",bunnyteaparty,"Sun,03/15/2020-10:35am","Personally, I think it's best to not restrict or count your calories at all, at least that was what I was taught in treatment, and I have found it is better for me. If you restrict or monitor your eating habits in some way there is a risk it could get worse or turn into a relapse. I think it's best to just listen to your body's signals and eat when you're hungry without counting calories or too strictly planning your meals.",recoveryj,"Sun,03/15/2020-10:46am","I agree with what the above poster had to say. Additionally, are you currently seeing a dietician? I would highly encourage you to seek one who specializes in EDs.

I was curious about different approaches to nutrition and eating. I've read that human body is so deprived after bulimia that it's necessary to eat about X kcal a day or more to heal and also to cure ""extreme hunger"".

I had people do and say harmful and insulting things to me because of the way I look and how I dress (I dress in more alternative and eccentric styles.) It did hurt then, but it's suddenly taking an even stronger emotional hold on me, to the point where I can't get through a day without thinking about it and breaking down crying, and it makes the urges to engage in harmful and disordered behaviors much stronger, despite the fact that it's been almost a year since I've graduated. I have talked to my therapist about it and we are working through it, but I'm wondering if anyone else who has gone through something similar has any advice on healing from experiences like this.

The scans SHOW my jaw is severely deficient and it’s agony. You’re not even paying the out of network doc, only the IN NETWORK hospital so denying on the basis of an out of network surgeon is crap. I am at the end of my rope. In my life, I usually pretend I’m fine with others because they say “how is it even possible to be in so much pain all time” because what other choice do I have? Greedy companies control our health, our suffering, our lives. Someone who doesn’t even know me is deciding whether my life is gonna be horrible pain, or give me a chance at a life I actually want to live.
And yet, here I am, not giving up. Whether I like it or not, survival has been in my bones since my earliest memories. It’s who I am. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t wear on my will to keep fighting. I’m still only human. And I need to try to accept my feelings for what they and not avoid it. I don’t know if I’m just venting or just looking for support because the pain is emotionally isolating. The support I get on here truly keeps me going.

If the insurance denies... first I’m going to get someone in charge on my phone because it can’t be that hard to make them understand that they’re not paying anything out of network. My Medicaid dental plan, which is totally separate, covers the surgeon and approved it! All the insurance is doing is the in network hospital and in network anesthesia. There is no logical reason for them to deny. So I will try to get them to understand that first. I will try to talk to their medical director if that’s what it takes.

646,03/11/2020,Tryingtoopenup,lostatsea,"I have been gradually opening up to one of my best friends about my ED and the related struggles, with a changing dynamic between us (we both like each other more than friends). He can be a little cold when I talk about my ED and my negative thoughts. He's the sort of person who doesn't like to beat around the bush and be straight to the point, but I receive it as cold-hearted and unsympathetic a lot of the time. I know he wants the best for me and wants to help, but I'm not receiving some of the things he says very well. I want to help him understand what I need to best support me, but I'm not sure exactly what to tell him. I also really want to open up to our other friends more, but it just feels like they can't understand. Is there anyone that can give advice or talk about their experience? I'm still trying to navigate what it takes to recover and how to change almost a lifetime of self-negativity. Anything you can do to help me to help my friends better understand would be greatly appreciated. It's really difficult and I'm struggling.",tryingtobebrave,"Wed,03/11/2020-10:14pm","When I was in treatment, I learned a lot about different styles of communication, and some people’s can be very different from our own and sometimes things end up being misinterpreted. Have you ever heard of assertive communication? There’s a lot of information online. An example would be:
When you do/ don’t do (blank), I feel (blank), because (blank). It might be helpful if you (blank).
So maybe something like
“When we are talking about my eating disorder and you respond straight to the point, I feel like my feelings/struggles aren’t heard, because I interpret your responses as being detached. It might help if you’re willing to be open emotionally/ more vulnerable during these conversations”. That’s just an example, and you can change it to however feels true to you. It’s important with assertive communication that you don’t use statements with “when you do blank, it makes me feel blank” and instead use I statements, “when you do blank, I feel blank”. I hope some of this makes sense. I was really surprised to find that this solved some the communication issues in friendships, because I have friends who are also more blunt, and I’m more sensitive and also can feel like they’re brushing it off or I’m being annoying. But it’s just different styles of communication.",lostatsea,"Thu,03/12/2020-2:25pm","That actually helps a lot. Thank you so much for sharing that.

I think the way you put it was perfect and really solidifies what I've been trying to figure out. I'm going to try that in my conversations and see how it goes.

648,03/11/2020,Surgerypostponed,tryingtobebrave,"So.... I still don’t know if the insurance will cover the surgery. I should have an answer by Friday. However, since the hospital needed an answer two days in advance, I won’t be having it done on Friday. There’s still hope it can happen within the next two months as long as the insurance says yes. Maybe before if there’s a cancelation at some point. Or the insurance can say no and id have to get a lawyer to sue the insurance and appeal it. I’m not really up for that so just hoping it goes through. I’ve been doing things to keep my mind off it, puzzles and coloring mandalas. I’m just really bleeping exhausted from life and my body right now. When the pain first started this badly, I coped with it for a year with a positive attitude because jaw surgery sounded like too big of a deal. But fast forward to a year later, which would be this same time last year, I couldn’t cope with it as will, if continued getting worse, I started being unable to chew my food enough and it messed with my stomach, and the pain started to be so wearing. So I decided to get the surgery and braces, luckily the orthodontist took my discount plan so it was tight but doable. I was still positive enough about the surgery happening now, when it’s supposed to. As the months dragged on last year, it became a matter of beating the pain and forcing myself to find small reasons to stay alive every day until surgery and I would find relief.
I wish more than anything I could just go into a coma until surgery because it feels like I cannot bear the pain for one more day. I’m not even angry anymore. I’m just worn down and done. I don’t get any kind of movement in anymore, it’s not worth any extra pain and fatigue. I haven’t seen any friends in too long, and I dread therapy because talking for an hour makes to pain worse. Freaking talking. Being awake hurts. I’m so over this.
I’m at a point where I’ve increased the amount of liquid nutrition I get, while I still have some solid food, I just don’t give a damn about eating enough to cause more pain. I’m not even anxious about insurance right now. I am just tired, down to my bones. My body feels like it’s ready to physically quit too a lot. My dietitian explained this to me as from a metabolic point of view, my body had kinda grinded to a halt because it’s chronically inflamed from having so much pain for so long. Makes sense. She also validated that I’m not getting movement and wasn’t judging at all. Actually, all my doctors have been great about that and supportive. If only insurance companies didn’t think they knew better than docs and didn’t care more about greed than human beings yanno.
I know I’m supposed to stay positive and strong etc but I’m only human, and this is just where I’m at.",alwaysthinking,"Thu,03/12/2020-6:36am","I'm really sorry that you had to deal with this.

651,03/08/2020,Lostandaloneinanewcountry,rubymay,"I'm not really sure where to start... my eating disorder (bulimia) only began two years ago. This time last year I was lucky enough to receive free treatment for 8 months (that was the allocated amount of treatment I was allowed). I was able to mostly overcome my body image issues but I still use food as a way to deal with stress.I'm currently on university exchange in Europe. Initially after arriving I was fine - I was busy meeting new people and didn't have time to slip into my old ways yet. But now I've had time to settle in and living in a different country has become lonely and I don't feel I have any close friends (my ex was my go-to last year) to talk about what I'm going through. The layout of my flat does not help because my flatmates eat in their rooms so so do I. As a result, food has started to become my only source of comfort. I've tried thinking back to what I learned in therapy and think of things that made me happy but I never truly found anything.I can tell its impacting my weight and am really scared this is going to spiral out of control especially when I have literally no one to talk to anymore.Any support or advice would be unbelievably appreciated",bluebird,"Wed,03/11/2020-2:03pm","Hi rubymay,I don't have any great wisdom to share with you, but I'm going through something similar. I'm not in a new country, but I just moved to a different part of my country and I don't have any friends here yet. I also went through a bad breakup last year, and used to tell my ex everything. I have had my eating disorder since I was 8 years old, and I'm 24 now. I have been working very hard at managing my eating, but it's hard sometimes because I also feel so depressed and lonely. Nothing seems to break through the fog, but I keep trying.If you haven't already, I suggest making a short list (3-5 things) of activities you can do for comfort, and then make sure you practice one of them every day, no matter how you feel. For me, yoga, meditation, painting, and rolling up in a blanket with my cat for 30 minutes all help me feel a little bit better. My second suggestion is to limit your time spent on introspective, solitary activities, particularly if you struggle with depression. I usually set a timer for 30-45 minutes, and then I make myself get up and be active when the timer goes off. And if I experience an urge to act out with food, I leave my apartment and go somewhere distracting until the urge passes. My last suggestion is... in my experience, happiness doesn't come when you're searching for it. I would focus more on the satisfaction you get from trying your very best, and do what is meaningful to you, even if the happiness isn't here yet. It will come!I'm right there with you.

652,03/09/2020,Plan,tryingtobebrave,"So, this week I will find out if I have surgery on Friday (probably the day before).
I talked to my therapist about how hopeless it feels if it gets canceled. My mom said we would get a lawyer and fight it. But I am so worn down, I don’t know if I can. My therapist said it’s okay to ask for help and rely on others when I’m depleted. It makes me feel useless and weak, but it feels like I’m at a point where I’d have to.
Anyway, part of my safety to plan is to spend a little time with my best friend Friday if the surgery doesn’t happen to help with the feelings of hopelessness and he’s one of the people I stay alive for when I want to give up. We’ve got each other’s backs. So I called him and told him all of that, and asked him not to let me back out of following through with my safety plan if I end up needing it. To drag my butt out the door lol. I’m keeping hope. I’m keeping faith. Feelings change moment to moment, but in this moment, I have faith.",iwanttolive,"Mon,03/09/2020-9:15pm","I was going to post you!!!!  Sounds funny, but anyway I wasn't sure if you wanted any as I know you are nervous about Friday's decision.  Did you get a chance to read the post under alwaysthing's that I wrote that I mentioned to you?I am glad that right now you have faith.  I know that I will be praying for you throughout this week.  Keep us posted.  I am glad you have a good friend.
My friend is in her late 70's, I am 52.  So it is a little different for you as you are not as ancient as I am, but she is really the only friend I have outside of the people I know.   There is a difference.I had an MRI Friday and received the results today.  My back is getting worse.  I didn't need an MRI to tell me that but it is needed as medical proof.  I have bone on bone in my back as the disc disintegrated.  Now the bone is chipping as there is no disc to cushion  them.  There is also nerve impingement which I could tell.  I am in constant pain.  I just started back up, tomorrow is my first case with my original agency, and if I have to leave again for back surgery, basically an nerve implant, I may never work for them again.  I am okay with that as I am trusting God more and more these days with my life.  I do know working makes the pain worse, but I need to work as long as I can.  Right now I am shuffling my feet when I walk.  It hurts to sit, kneel down, stand back up, stand, walk, lay down.  Everything.  I will be calling my one pain management doctor tomorrow who does these procedures and at the time it was decided not to go through with the procedure but now that there is more breakdown in my back and PT didn't work and chiropractic efforts are minimally effective, I am going to go ahead and do it.  One of other discs is flattened out, squeezed and the spinal cord is impinged.  I know my pain does not compare to yours, but it does affect me a lot and is getting worse.  I worry about it affecting my ability to walk but my doctor told me today not to worry about that now.  Trusting God is not always easy.  Knowing my parents are getting older.  Knowing my sister is so sick.  Knowing that my back is so bad.  Being peri-menopausal.  But in all these things, I trust because what else am I to do?  Who else am I to turn to?
My new therapist is really good.  I am really glad I made the change.  I am sorry that this has been such a terrible time for you.  Let's hope together that you are able to get coverage.  Did you ever look into charity care?

653,03/04/2020,FixationOnFood,Miggi,"Ever since my eating started becoming disordered I've had a bad fixation on food. Watching food related videos and posts. Taking a bunch of ""What's your favorite food?"" quizzes. Liking to talk about food. And I usually think two meals ahead for what my next meal will be. I always eat at the same time, and i anxiously await that time. I am always thinking about food. And I plan my life around it! I get really anxious when my ""food plan."" gets foiled. Anyone else relate to this? Any advice?",tryingtobebrave,"Wed,03/04/2020-10:36pm","I relate to this, I went through something very similar earlier in my recovery. If it helps you to know, this eventually passed for me and a lot of people go through it too. In recovery it takes time for your relationship with food to change. Do you find yourself fixating more on types of food that you’re used to restricting? It can also be overwhelming if you’re eating more than before recovery, you’re not used to food being a focus in your life (in a recovery sense- from my experience I fixated on calories before recovery). The more “permission” you give yourself to nourish your body, and the longer you’re in recovery and your body starts to trust that it will be nourished, you can move through this stage. But in my experience, during this phase, the more fixated I was on food, like anticipating the next meals of the day, it gets into a cycle where you just keep becoming more fixated. Try to stay focused on the current meal, and in between, try to focus on non food related things, helped me. I know it can be difficult, but it’s like strengthening a mental muscle. The more you practice, the stronger it gets. I hope this helps, and you’re not alone. Hugs",Blue44,"Thu,03/05/2020-4:13pm",Whenever I am restricting I tend to think a lot about food. You are not alone.,AndiTutti,"Mon,03/09/2020-6:27pm","In the depths of my restriction, all I could ever think about was food. I would have my whole day planned out to be exactly right. If I was waiting for it to be the ""right time"" to eat I would take quizzes about food that had pictures of different foods or I would go on social media and watch food videos. Ever since starting recovery not that long ago, my food obsession has decreased dramatically. It's definitely still there and some days more than others, but I am still early in my recovery and have trust that it will fade even further. Restriction only makes your fixation stronger. I repeat: restriction is what is causing your fixation! Please reach out to your doctor and get help-- recovery is worth it! (And like I've said a million times by now, it will help with your food obsession!)
Also, I know from personal experience that ""going off plan"" is scary but the way to erase that fear eventually is to practice! Again, I am still working on this myself but I trust it will in time. Healing takes time has been my mantra lately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know she is exhausted from being bedside with my sister in the hospital for a week, plus another week all day but she slept at home.  She is 78 years old. She is not dealing with my sisters illness all that well and is overdoing it.  I am not mad with her, I just don't know what to do when she starts freaking out on me and then my father gets upset but she tells him he is not involved and tonight he listened and walked away.  I just have to remain calm, not try to defend myself and this too will pass.I am angry with my sister and I need to let go of it.  She wasn't home for several hours when she starts berating our mother because my mom spoke to one of her doctors and I heard her on her phone and then she came out of her room and started telling me how terrible it is that Mom would do something so terrible.  She is very ungrateful and has no idea that she is.  My mother has put her life on hold, and has been bedside, sleeping in a jerry chair, for weeks at a time, trying to help her.  Then she gets mad because she doesn't want my mother talking to any of her doctors.  The next time she wants to talk about my mother like that she will get the hand and talk to my hand.  I will not tolerate this rude and selfish behavior.The other thing is I am going through my changes.  Hot and cold within minutes of each other.  Not sleeping.

My dad was absolutely horrible to my mom today. Said some very cruel things. Is totally ungrateful for everything she does for him. He works and she stays at home, but she does just as much as him. Yes she uses cleaning as a coping mechanism (hmm I wonder why??? Not..) but she still does everything for him. Cooks his meals, does his laundry, pays the bills, cleans the house.. and he’s so mean to her. So ungrateful. I was so angry. I wanted to scream and cry and I felt like a little kid. I know his bipolar affects his behavior but the things he says are deliberately cruel, and that’s more than just being irritable. I think my dad is truly just a mean spirited person, and it is not only his mental illness. It’s just who he is. I have mixed feelings because I resent his abuse when I was a kid, I resent how he verabqlly abuses my mom, and to accept him for who he
is feels like looking the other way and it feels wrong. I was going to ask him to handle the lawyer for me if it comes to it but I will not. I will force myself even if it breaks me to do it myself. Even though I have nothing left right now with which to fight. All I can do is leave it to God. I know we have to act ourselves too, but I just cannot right now. I don’t know how to explain it.

Have you ever looked into that?The hospital will help you set up a doable payment plan.  And again, trusting God with everything, even this.  Trusting Him doesn't mean the insurance will pay for the surgery, but that God will be with you and help you pay the bill.  It may be in small payments.  It may be through charity care.

I was discharged from inpatient hospital recently and I have returned to my old habits.ive lost weight and being penalised by my community team, I'm fourteen so still in camhs.Its quite stressful like I have no control or else I will have to live with thse thoughts. I’ve been trying to restrict under the unnerving stares of my parent. However I'm still losing weight. I don't want to repeat this illness I want to do so much with my life so why do I keep getting trapped in this awful cycle of restriction. I really dont want my parents to have to suffer again and watch me return back to the corpse I used to be. What should I do I'm so scared.

I understand once being diagnosed with an ED it is a life long struggle and many different things play a part in the ability to keep on track throughout the recovery process. I would love to hear what others think/feel about the struggle of maintain recovery and if it also feels like it is now something you have to be aware of thought the course of life and what that means to you. Is it something you view as a life-long disorder now? Maintaining recovery is a daily challenge for many who struggle, Keep going!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iwanttolive",alwaysthinking,"Sat,03/07/2020-6:23am","It's been rough. Thursday, I went in to see my therapist and I also ended up going into the ER because I was extremely suicidal. But as so often happens, I prayed like crazy and Jehovah God help me out as he always does.  And now I feel amazing and ready to conquer the world. I realize that my biggest issue was that I was just getting majorly overwhelmed. I recently got diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I also am dealing with  multiple chemical sensitivities to fragrances and it causes me to have allergic reactions. It has made me have to avoid just about everybody, Including going anywhere that has to do with my spiritual routine. And that has pretty much destroyed me because I Desperately need my spiritual life to  Keep me alive. But Jehovah has helped me as always and I know what I need to do in order to keep going.

I am sorry things continue to be so challenging for you but am happy to hear you are still clinging onto our Heavenly Father.  Sometimes we can not hold onto Him but He always is holding onto us.  In the Old Testament, Moses was the leader and there was a battle.  God told Moses to raise his arms up and while he held them up they were winning the battle.  When they lowered, they started losing the battle.  So he needed help as no one can hold their arms up in the air for an entire day.  I believe it was Aaron and I forget the other who helped him hold his arms up and they won the battle.  I say this because  there are times God knows we need extra help and need others to help us do what we know we need to do or are asked to do.  He provides those people to help us.  You don't have to do this alone.  God also knows there are times we are not able to be out serving, but knows our hearts.  He sent Jesus to do all the ""work"" for us.  We do not have to earn God's love or acceptance.  We are accepted in Jesus once we have surrendered our lives to Him.  No other faith has the God come down to earth, in the human form of Jesus, to rescue us because we will never be able to ""do"" enough, or ""Be good enough"" to earn or have His favor.  It is given as a gift.  We need to accept this gift and rest in God's love and salvation.  This is so important to understand because it releases us from guilt of not doing enough, not reading enough, not serving enough, not giving enough and so on.  Jesus did it all.  We now serve because we love Jesus. Not to earn His love.  We are loved.  We go out and serve because we are loved and we love God back.  I hope this all makes sense.  I know it is somewhat different from what you believe but I hope you pray about it and see if you find some scriptures to make it real for you.  You are loved unconditionally.  Rest in His love.He has you.  I am alive today because of God's love for me and God not giving up on me even when I was struggling with my faith.  I am thankful He remains faithful.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

662,03/05/2020,Binge/StarveCycle&PCOS,miliz,"Hi, This is my first time posting, so I apologize if I ramble - I was recently diagnosed with an eating disorder this past summer after having struggling with it for years. I spent all summer working with a dietician and personal trainer, and was feeling really great about my progress. However, a months ago I moved away from home and I'm really struggling to stay healthy. I'm also diagnosed with PCOS, which makes it extremely hard for me to lose weight although I'm on two weight loss medications (prescribed by my doctor). I feel stuck in this loop of starving and then binging, and I feel too guilty too reach out to my friends and family to seek support. My mom is also so petite and it's hard to talk to her about it, because it just turns into a conversation about me not working hard enough to be healthy. This summer I worked so hard and I feel like I've lost any progress I've ever made, and I feel like I have no self control and can't help but feed into this self-destructive behavior. I feel awful because I know that when I'm going through this cycle it's not good for me but somehow I always come back to it. I also see pictures of myself and I feel like I don't recognize myself, like the person in the mirror isn't the person in the picture. I feel ugly, and I don't know when I'm ever going to be able to accept myself for who I am regardless of how I look.",Blue44,"Thu,03/05/2020-4:15pm",Welcome to the forum. I’m glad that you posted.

I read about PCOS and I can tell that this is definitely a struggle when you have an eating disorder for sure. I don't have advice obviously. But I do empathize with you. I know how I would feel, And it would definitely be a major struggle for me if I had to have this. I am so sorry and I hope that you are able to talk with a therapist or someone that you feel close to be able to cope with this. I am glad you posted and I hope you get the support that you desperately need.",stillhere52,"Sat,03/07/2020-9:22pm","First of all:
You are beautiful no matter how you look, even if you can't feel it right now - you will get there. <3Also: I can definitely relate to the binge/starve cycle. I don't know much about PCOS, but binge/starve was what really kept me in my eating disorder. It's such a hard cycle and reinforces itself. Starving yourself/depriving yourself of enough food - even though it seems like it might help - just makes food really pleasurable when you do eat it, so it's especially hard not to binge, and it throws your hunger/fullness cues out of whack which just makes everything confusing! I found that the best way I was able to recover was by eating three times a day consistently. I know it's exactly the opposite of what you want to do, but this was the only way I was able to reset my body's rhythms and get back my fullness cues. It was hard at first, because I felt like anytime I ate I wanted to just keep eating... my mom really helped me by reminding me (with kindness) that I have a choice and am not controlled/made to binge (not that it's not hard! but it was helpful when I felt strong urges to remember that). Obviously there will be times that will be harder, and you will make some mistakes, but this is what helped me get to a point where now I feel like I can eat when I'm hungry and stop when I'm full. It's honestly a huge relief, and I feel like now that things feel more stable and intuitive, I can make slow but consistent and healthy progress towards my goal weight. Before stopping the starve/binge cycle everything felt way too out of control to be able to make decisions about anything.It might be helpful also to think about what YOUR definition of healthy is, vs your mom's, the media's, your ED's, etc. What do you want for yourself, for your life? I know that's a big question, but something to think about :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
663,03/06/2020,"update,iwanttolive",iwanttolive,"Hello friends.  I have not been on much as I am stepping down a little bit, but I want to let all of you who know me how I have been doing.  In one word; Great!!!Things have really never been as good for me as they have been since I got out of the hospital in November.  It was not really necessary that I went in, but it was a decision based on stopping behaviors that I hadn't engaged in for fifteen months not snowball.  Since I have been out there has not been anymore self harm except on small time.  The eating  is good.  There are some weeks when I eat more than I want to, but I am overall making good choices and I still really like my sweets, but that is because I am sweet!!))))My relationships with my sisters are still guarded but not terrible.  My one friend who was not really in my life for many years now is not in it all at this point but I know she is struggling with her own social insecurities.  I am letting her go, forgiving her for things she has done, accept my role in the dissolvement of the friendship and am moving on.I am still involved with church and doing the Bible study at my house with an additional prayer meeting at my house as we really need to be praying right now for our country and so many other things.I am now peri-menopausal which is just so much fun!!!  Hot at night, nauseous.  Some hot feelings during the day but all dealable.    I think I made up that word.So, my sister is quite ill again and was in the hospital for about two and a half weeks and is waiting to go back to University of Penn in a few weeks.  Learning to trust God with all things right now.  Since moving out of my parents home a few months ago, my father and I are getting along very well and it is a lot better all the way around.  My roommate and I are getting along.So as you can see, things are going well.  The depression is at an all time low.  Working part time with two agencies.  Working with a new and wonderful therapist close to my house.  Dealing with a lot of back pain but still walking so I a not complaining.  Many people fast around this time of the year and while I am not fasting from food I am fasting for forty days from negativity and feasting on positivity.  Something that some people I know have been doing for a few years and a brief teaching comes on my inbox each morning.I can not believe I am so happy and so well adjusted.  Still working on things in therapy that have kept me hung up for all my life but this too will see positive results.  I always espoused full recovery and believed in it, but actually living a life of recovery and enjoying things and not being so scared and traumatized every day by just having to face each day is so wonderful. I share this with you to offer you Hope and that one day you too may start to see better days and for those of you who are, tell others so that they can be encouraged.  We are on this road together and we are fellow warriors.",tryingtobebrave,"Fri,03/06/2020-9:40pm","I love you, and I am so happy to hear you’re doing well. This gives me hope.

I had a really good visit with my dietitian today. I feel proud of how far I’ve come in recovery. Of course it’s not perfect, there was disordered thoughts we addressed but overall I’ve made so much progress. I’m going to start seeing her for a little while, because after surgery I can only get nutrition through liquids for six weeks and this is will be a challenge in recovery. But I’m being proactive with it by seeing my dietitian and she gave me a detailed plan with various options for nutrition. The challenge with meeting it I think is more physical than mental post op, but I can do it. I also am going to keep an appointment if the surgery doesn’t happen, so that I won’t give up on recovery even if it feels like it doesn’t matter. It does.

666,03/02/2020,JointHypermobility/pain,efo11,"So this probably a super weird question...but has anyone else had issues with their joints? I struggled with anorexia for about a year and a half before I began to recover. Ever since gaining weight, I have noticed how my joints are extremely mobile and I have back pain worse than ever before. When I was at my lowest weight I did not notice either of these issues, but now that I’ve gained some weight, I feel it a majority of the time. My major in college is athletic training so it is very body-involved, and requires quite a bit of strength. My joints pop all the time when doing normal motions or even placing moderate pressure on someone else. I also am extremely flexible to the point where my classmates think they are going to hurt me. I am assuming this is just due to a lack of muscle and stabilization of the joints? As for the back pain, its the same idea. I have gotten adjusted at a chiropractor but the pain returns quickly, I can't imagine it a muscle tightness issue considering I don't really have any right now, as I have not returned to exercising regularly.
