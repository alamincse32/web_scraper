0,10/25/2021,UnsureifIhaveadisorder,B4TM4N,"My wife is concerned I have an unhealthy relationship with food because I count calories and macros daily. I do have a bit of body dysmorphia because of a lot of things:
When I was a kid I was very skinny as a wrestler, so that did harbor a negative relationship with food at a young age. College freed me from that and I put on a ton of weight rapidly. Then I lost a lot of weight to get healthier about 4 yes after graduation, which focused mostly on avoiding certain foods and exercising. And I was in a stage performance in 2019 where I lost weight to fit a vision, but I had the understanding that I wouldn't ever do that again once the show ended.
Since then I've just been counting to make sure I eat the right amount of food for my size, and keep things balanced. This to me feels like a more generalized idea of eating. I also exercise several times a week. I'm not skipping meals, though I do tend to skip a snack in the day and then binge later at night.Is this obsessive? Or some type of disorder?",_admin_moderator,"Tue,10/26/2021-12:27am","Hi B4TM4N! Welcome to the forums! Your post has been edited to comply with NEDA’s Community Guidelines.

But what I would ask myself is to what extent these sorts of things are getting in the way of things from an emotional standpoint.  That would seem to be what defines "" a problem"" to me.
Also, what sort of level of anxiety or self-condemnation might you find yourself feeling if you strayed from whatever routine you have set for yourself ?  I think that's a measure of things as well.
In any case, just some things to think about.",,,,,,,,,
1,10/14/2021,AMIBULIMIC?,nikos,"It started last year ,while i was 18 years old.I spent a rough year stressing over exams and at the same period i was really afraid not to gain any weight ,because of the limited time i had to workout .My weight was never a real problem .Nevertheless, i started developing in my head this constant fear of gaining weight.So , i balanced my time between reading and working out daily.I also had a pretty strict diet(cutting out certain food groups),which i maintained for 2 months and lost some weight .People started commenting on my beautiful body so i felt really uplifted .Everything felt great and even though i was extremely pressured ,i managed to balance all that and was feeling really healthy.I feel that the real problem started developing the summer after the exams .After all that pressure ,i could finally let loose of myself.So i stopped watching my diet and gradually till august i had gained all the  weight back.I still felt ok with my weight as i knew that other people couldn't really tell the difference.But i started feeling more dissatisfied with myself than ever before.My clothes would't fit me perfectly and my eating habits had gotten back to normal.I was at 0 .And then...quarantine gave me a hard slap on the face.I couldn't play volleyball anymore,which was my passion since forever.I couldn't go to college , took online courses instead.I couldn't see my friends .It was a big change in my life ,it felt like everything was falling apart.I think i spent months being depressed,arguing with my parents,doing nothing productive with my life .They didn't even allow us celebrate christmas with our loved ones.I could literally see my life passing by...I think that's when i started finding confort in food.All i did was binge eating ,watching series all day and feeling bad about myself.   After those months ,coffee shops and gym were finally open again .My decision was to take advantage of my free time and get out of that cycle.So i started working at a coffe shop ,took driving classes,enrolled to the gym etc.I thought it was all over .I thought that keeping myself busy would make my food problem disapear .Instead i was always exhausted from work and started binging even more.I still couldn't realize i had a problem.I spent the whole summer thinking about my body and my weight.Then summer ended..  The now: Now ,a year later, i finally left town to go to a university.I'm still adapting to the new life:new home,new town ,new people ...As one can imagine im pretty stressed.At first ,i really tried eating healthy and maintaining my weight.But now,i find myself binge eating exta amounts of food uncontrolably.I just can't control myself.I consume food till i can't move from the pain .Then i feel awful and weak ,but i always end up doing it again .Im Often so swollen and embarassed to get out .I cancel my plans and sit home all day hurting.I've tried purging.Today i made it for the first time.It was this moment i realized things are serious and im not just simply walk away from something like this .It sickenes my mind even thinking about it .Im desperate,im afraid,i can't control it ,don't know what's hapening and why ...I just want to stop worrying about my weight .Please help.P.S.

2,09/30/2021,DoIhaveaneatingdisorder?,kga63,"Hi guys, this is kinda scary lol.  Anyways I am a 19 year old male, a freshman in college.  I am reaching out because I am scared to talk to people I know in person about this topic.  I have not gone to the doctor about any of my mental health concerns due to fear of my parents overworrying about me which makes me stress out more.  If I say that I have a mental health disorder or imply that I feel like I have it, and I do not but this process offends anybody I sincerely apologize.
I have been struggling with what I feel is anxiety for years now, but it is not to the point where it messes with my functionality so I think i'm fine there.  I started having what i belive to be bipolar episodes in eight grade.  I go through phases where I am extremely depressed, but then something can happen and I will become extremly happy, but I am also more happy than sad so IDK if I qualify as bipolar.  Now with the eating disorder it has been going on since freshman year.  I would change my body to what other people wanted.  During football season I was a lineman and would gain weight to be at my heaviest.  I was 5 foot 5 at the time.  I would do this by stuffing myself full of food.  During baseball season however I would need to lose weight, the lowest I got during baseball was less than my heaviest and I was 5 foot 7.  The way I acheived this was by starving myself for 2-3 days while doing my atheltics.  Then I would gourge myself for a day, feel terrible and start over. I was so proud of the number on the scale, but still hate the way my body looks.  About 3 months ago I stopped starving myself and havent felt like this, but recently I have started hating my body again even though I havent put on any weight and I feel that I am going to fall back into that cycle.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,10/01/2021-2:05pm","Hi Kga63!

I am very happy that I loss that tremendous amount of weight in my age, to be healthier and so I can wear all my fitted clothes.

At first I said i’m gonna eat only certain foods and because I have money I can buy food whatever I want and how much I want to consume I hide a food from my cousin and to mom in my closet go outside when my mom and cousin are busy, then increase how much I eat, which is very high for my age and it very depressing for me and concerning.

I am a high school swimmer who has been dealing with restriction and purposeful under-eating for a little over a year now.

Even just after 2 weeks of starting to consume more and challenging my thoughts, I've noticed a significant increase in my energy levels, speed, endurance, and overall disposition to swimming. Especially as a swimmer, we've been told to not eat before swimming to avoid nausea and stomach pain, and my disordered mind took that a bit too far. Now what I try to focus on is imagining my food directly powering my body, and not only does that help my relationship with food improve, but it also pushes me to be faster in a healthy sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,

8,04/10/2021,Ineedtovent,barrettamaryllis,"TW: Addiction (specifically stimulants)Hi, I need to vent on here because friends aren't forever and family has a loud mouth.I'm an 18yr male and just made it half way thru my first year of college (ironically psychology major). As a kid I was always known as the ""skinny kid"" since most of the cousins my age were heavier than me. Then around the age of 9, after the best cruise to the Bahamas with the grandparents, I came back a more fitting member of my cousins. Everyone made comments, some were mean, but my mom's left scars. It felt like I fell off a ladder I didn't even know I was standing on. I didn't do much about it, I hated my body, but I guess not enough until my freshman year of high school when I started using my prescribed medication (with some lovely side affects) to erase some history. Though, I never consistently took them until about 6 months ago. Ever since then I've depended on stimulants to maintain my grades and body (as a college students that's basically my entire life) and I've lost a noticeable amount. I'm starting to think it's less about my weight and more about the feeling of stimulants on an empty stomach, but beginning to feel satisfied with my body is another awesome high I've never felt. I've also started being more active and taking other stuff whenever I reopen those scars. I realize the consequences of my past decisions and the ones I'm making now. I'm not ready to open that door until I am happy with my body (gotta have something nice to sleep on). I feel like I've been preparing for the worst since that horrible cruise.Sad thing is I always though I'd settle with my body being ""average"", but there's always a step higher on the ladder.But I hate to end on a bad note so now I'm going to go watch my favorite show.",BobJ48,"Mon,04/12/2021-11:38am","Yep, there's being thin…and the process of becoming thin.People can be happy about the former, but become addicted to the latter, and that can be where the trouble begins.

I typically don't start eating till about 12, but have recently been eating breakfast at school cause I've even started to get hungry then. When I do eat I bring food to go along with school lunch or whatever I've made for the day, (school lunch typically has smaller nutritional values of everything you need to make up for what some kids may not be getting at home)After that I eat a snack.Then for dinner we typically have protein heavy meals, but there are always carb and veggie options.

(like right now I just had a meal, started with a small plate and waited for everyone to eat, then went back for more)At about 1 AM I eat whatever I can find.I eat all this during the week, the weekends are similar but my meal times are much more unplanned and also more of what my body considers a ""snack""I currently do not do much for physical activity, I am in band, I play mallet percussion, and I sleep about 12 hours a day.

10,03/03/2021,IwasjustdiagnosedwithBodyDysmorphicDisorderat22.,fintimd,"This is going to be a bit of an unorganized train of thought, so please bare with me. I'm still processing all of this.I've struggled with my body image for my entire life. It's been almost an obsession. Ever since I was a teenager, I have spent large parts of my day looking over myself in the mirror. I've had to stare at my face in the rear view mirror while driving. I've had to turn and look at my reflection in every single store window that I've passed. At work or with friends I've often found myself pulling out my phone to look at myself in the selfie camera. I'd never take any pictures -- I hated all of them -- but it was like a portable mirror. It's been agonizing. I've gone through diet and exercise binges more times than I can count. I'd run so much that my legs and joints would begin to ache. I've lost and gained absurd amounts of weight multiple times in just the last three years.I remember a night two years ago in particular that was particularly hard. I was a summer Resident assistant in a dorm at my university, and while the entire building was staffed, only two of the floors had residents -- the rest were set aside to rent out to conferences. I had my own room for the first time in years, and the bathroom was built into the bedroom. The room was sized for three, and the floor had 50 rooms, but for the most part only I and one other person were up there. None of my friends were in town, so I spent most of my time by myself in an over-sized room in an empty dorm. It was oppressive, and my body image concerns exploded. This one particular night, I was up until well past three in the morning staring at myself shirtless in the mirror. I'd go sit at my computer and play some games, only to feel the compulsion to get up and do it again. I spent hours just sitting there, staring at myself -- revolted by what I saw. I had a couple of panic attacks. It's not as bad today, but I still do it. I'll get up multiple times a day, pretend to use the bathroom, and then spend that time just gawking at myself in the mirror. Sometimes I'll weigh myself a few times a day, too.I finally sought help this last December. My girlfriend of one year had left me, and I felt utterly worthless. I was spending those long hours in front of a mirror over and over again. It didn't help that by that point, the relationship and the pandemic caused me to gain back all of the weight that I had previously lost. By sheer chance, the therapist I saw for anxiety was a specialist in eating disorders, and she first diagnosed me with Binge Eating disorder and we've been working on that since the start of February. Yesterday, she amended that diagnosis to include Body Dysmorphic Disorder because of my compulsive tendencies. I'm relieved to finally be getting treatment, but I also feel weird and anxious about all of this. I'm the only male patient that my therapist has, and I'm going to be the only man in the eating disorder support group that I'll be starting soon. Most of the resources that I've found and my therapist had available were oriented towards women, and that stigma makes it really difficult to discuss it with anyone. I also find myself constantly doubting my diagnoses, and falling back into unconscious dietary restriction or extreme exercise. I've been obsessing about numbers. It's like I'm fighting back against the notion that there's something wrong with me so that I can go right back to restriction. I feel kind of stuck in this by myself. I don't really have a support system outside of therapy. All of this is honestly stressful and confusing.",BobJ48,"Mon,03/08/2021-6:05pm","Good for you for getting treatment.  When stuff gets in the way of our life like this, it's best to try and get on top of it before it imprints itself on our brain in ways that become harder and harder to get rid of. About being the only guy in your ED support group, you'll have to see how that goes.  I work on an online ED support group, and while the majority of members are female, it's been my experience that men are accepted as well.  It's also possible that your presence as a guy could be helpful to the rest of the members.  They may feel a certain amount of shame that EDs ""are a girl thing"" and seeing that they can effect guys as well, may help them broaden their perspective in ways that are helpful both for them, and for you as well.  As you said though, when it comes to EDs, it can be hard for other people to relate to them. This part can be difficult for women too.  Like how people think it's about vanity and such, when it's really about so much more.  Not sure what's to be done about that - EDs can be pretty complicated and I'm not sure that we can expect the general public to understand them.  Plus expecting the person who has the issue to also be the one who has to educate their friends about it…that's asking a lot I think.  So you are right, that is a tough matter it's true. But again, good for you for trying to get some help with this.  Asking for help for anything can be a hard thing for guys, so simply the idea that you are somewhat open to that sounds like a positive thing to me. I'm not sure if you'll post again, but if you do, I'd be interested in hearing how you find yourself feeling about the support group. In the mean time, hang in there if you can. And try and remember that you are you, and not just some diagnosis.",fintimd,"Wed,03/10/2021-2:35am","Bob,I really appreciate your comment. It certainly helps put the eating disorder group into perspective. I really like the idea that my presence might help them with their stigmatized struggles as well. It's really hard to move myself out of this feeling of terror regarding the group, though.My first session will be within the next few days(I don't want to give specifics) and I'll update here with how I feel afterwards. A lot of my fear regarding my body and my appearance is tied up in how I feel women perceive me, so there's a lot of anxiety going into this on that basis alone. I know logically that women aren't constantly judging me, and that this will be an inherently accepting environment, but the fear of being repulsive tends to override everything else. To be clear, in this line of disordered thinking, I don't think that women are at fault. I just feel like I'm extraordinarily off-putting to everyone around me through my own defects, and my desire for validation from women makes that fear that much worse. I really doubted my diagnosis of Body Dysmorphia the day that my therapist told me about it, but the more that I think about it and read about it, the more that I realize that it can't be anything else. This feeling of be inherently and justifiably repulsive to everyone around me, and the constant self-checking and hiding that this involves has been an absolutely overwhelming force in my life. I felt like I looked the same at my lowest weight as I do at my highest weight and nothing that I've done to forcibly change my body has changed that perspective on myself. I really hope that this treatment helps. I'm sick of feeling like some wretched abomination of a person.",fintimd,"Thu,03/18/2021-4:30pm","Bob,I have now had two sessions of my online eating disorder group and I have really mixed feelings about it. I've found that being the only man in the group is incredibly anxiety-inducing, and a lot of the exercises are really triggering. It's run by eating disorder specialists at my university, but I'm really struggling with it. The Zoom component in particular is REALLY hard. I find myself spending most of the sessions staring at my own screen. I'm going to keep with it and see if things improve, but this is hard.",,,,,,

I have always struggled with self confidence, body image, depression, but one year it kind of took me to the point of starting to do unhealthy behaviors and it took over my life. About two years ago I was in a relationship with an athlete and being active was their life. Seeing them I always felt as if my body, my performance, or just what I looked like in general was not good enough. Subconsciously I thought that if I lost weight that is would be more likely that 1) I’d be good enough and 2) I’d feel better about myself. That’s when the target behaviors began, and it really took over my life. I was constantly thinking about food, counting every calorie, and restricting very extremely the day after I had had a target behavior incidence, or I would just do the target behavior every day multiple times a day. It was miserable. The person I was in a relationship with new nothing about my mental health or eating disorder, and for a while not a single person did so I just felt lonelier and lonelier and it got worse and worse. I thought losing weight would help but no matter how much weight I lost or what I looked like I was never happy. Being an athlete on top of all of this made it so much worse. Without getting any nutrients I made no progress with sports. I would be in the weight room 3-4 times a week for about two years, and I made no progress. With my ED it made progress practically impossible, and any time the weights did go up and I made any sort of progress, my ED got worse and I lost it all 20x faster than I made it. All my friends were lifting gettin bigger and stronger, and I was the only one who was lifting and getting weaker. Being a young male with the majority of my friends being talented athletes, it really didn’t help. I was embarrassed by my size, wether I thought I was big or small at the time, I was embarrassed by my performance, the weights I could lift, and pretty much everything. This was life, and it was only getting worse. I felt extremely depressed every day, guilty, and like a failure because I couldn’t control my eating habits. My girlfriend would make fun of me for not eating a lot and I would kind of just laugh itoff, but she had zero clue that the night before I had binged and purged significantly to the point where I didn’t want to even looks at food because I thought it would somehow make me gain weight. The day of my very first track meet I took off my shirt to change into a jersey and a couple guys told me “ you aren’t built for this sport” and I had a mom come up to me after words and say I was too skinny and I needed to eat food. I couldn’t win no matter what I did, and I still thought I needed to lose weight. I have a picture of me very thin and it was supposed to be the “ before” picture for a “ weight loss journey”. To me it was never the number on the scale even though seeing it go down helped, but I just was never happy with how I looked. The thought of my girlfriend having any affection towards me was impossible, just because I couldnt believe anyone else could love me just cause I don’t see any positives about myself. My last season of soccer was two years ago, last year was cancelled cause of Covid, and I am not able to participate this year because of my mental health. I feel like the ED has taken everything from me. I am still struggling, but I want to end this story with some positives. I am getting help. I am currently at a residential center and even though I still feel hopeless, it feels better just to be doing something about it. Eating disorders really suck, especially while you’re an athlete. No matter what age you are, gender, anything, just know you’re not alone. Asking for help isn’t easy, but I can say from experience that this is nearly impossible to do alone. Thanks for taking the time to read this, I hope everyone is taking a step towards recovery and making a change for the better.",BobJ48,"Thu,02/04/2021-2:25pm","I'm not sure if you meant this as a gift, but thanks for taking the time to post about your experience.
Even though we are supposed to know better, I think people still tend to believe that EDs are for women. But your reactions are almost exactly the same as what other ED sufferers go through.
 The ""good enough"" thing, and the lure of self-discipline really can draw a person in, in ways that seem reasonable to begin with, but which can begin to assert control over a person in the opposite way that they expected it to.
Plus like you said, when getting bigger seems wrong, and getting smaller seems wrong too, things really can start to feel mentally disorienting, and it can become hard to put much faith in our thinking at all.
You didn't mention if you were residential voluntarily, but just to say, the fact that you could list some potential positives, that's a good sign I think, even if things still feel hopeless at times.
Also, I hope you find that you are willing to take some risks while you are there.  I'm suspect you know what I mean, in that a person can be asked to do things that simply don't feel right at all, so being able to take risks, and being willing to believe that they might actually help move things forward, no matter how wrong they may feel at the time…if you find that you can take those risks, even if at the time it may feel like you are losing control instead of gaining it.  If you find yourself willing to experiment in those ways, despite what those ED thought patterns may be trying to tell you, then that may be a positive sign too.
Whatever the case, if you feel like writing some more, I hope that you will.  The whole recovery thing, it's like a mental journey I think, and like explorers of old, we can't always be sure where we are, but being able to keep walking forward, in spite of our doubts, that really is a lot of it I think.",,,,,,,,,,,,
12,05/16/2020,NotEating/LosingWeight,yorkhaven36,"Hi, my name is Patrick and I am 36 years old. I am reaching out bc I am losing weight regularly and not eating well. I haven’t ate well in about two months. I was losing weight during the winter and my doctor did tests on me. They all came back fine and well. I was healthy. Since March, I have not ate well at all. I consume little during the day and at nighttime and that’s bad. I lose a few pounds a week estimated. I fear swallowing and eating due to an episode back in March when i did choke on some food. I fear if I when I eat now I’ll choke, have heartburn, be bloated, or excessively burp. All of these symptoms are true to a degree. My doctor doesn’t seem to want to help me after a few months ago. My family is unsure how to help me thru this crisis of mine. I’m unsure what to do next. I did reach out to a counselor for help that’s a start. I should call my doctor back but what to say something but what. They will be horrified of how I look. My family is horrified of my appearance as well. My weight loss is the cause. I’m at a crossroads. I care about my health and want to get better. I’m unemployed for the past few months as well. Life has been a challenge a well. It seems to be better to be stuck in old ways and not care. Feel free to message me back with any thoughts or feedback would be appreciated. Thanks, Patrick",_admin_moderator,"Sun,05/17/2020-11:59pm","Hi yorkhaven36. We edited your post to remove numbers and mentions of specific foods, which are not allowed on the forums.

A person can find themselves being fearful that the same thing might happen again if they eat. If there are other things happening in your life right now that cause you to be anxious, those anxieties might attach themselves to you fear of choking as well.  Maybe you know how that can be - we worry that bad things might happen to us, and when we look around, sometimes we see that it's true!  Look at how thin you have become, and how difficult it is to eat!  So the thing that we want to avoid to try to stay safe (eating) ends up causing outcomes that only increase our anxiety instead.   Kind of like a snake eating it's own tail, if you know what I mean ?Sometimes our worries can go around in circles like that. Particularly if there are other things happening in our lives that cause us anxiety too. So yes, I think you are being wise by reaching out to a counsellor.  They may be able to help you with this, because it sounds like it's nothing that you are enjoying at all.",flightbeast,"Tue,07/07/2020-8:28pm",hmm,karen11,"Thu,08/27/2020-4:05pm",Hi Yorkhaven the same thing is happening to me. I got sick this year in February I had a flair up of my IC to where it is hard to eat any foods without getting sick. I have ate but it is not healthy I do not know how to choose the right foods because I am scared of getting sick. The recalls of foods scare me the ingredients is bad for me because of covid 19. I wanted the doctor to help me but they say I am healthy. Now I am afraid of gaining back the weight it is battle.,,,
13,07/08/2020,Ican’tstopeating,Antwire,"So I’ve always been bigger than I should be but in the last 10 years I’ve gained a significant amount I fascinate about food, I drive past a shop and think “they sell that” then I go and buy it all and eat it all. For example I could easily got to Morrison’s and buy way too much. Then eat it all in the car on the way home and then come home and eat something else. yesterday I did the above and then for lunch a really large meal, followed by a large dinner. I litteraley never feel full and never feel hungry. a few years ago I was lucky and got onto afitness programme the local authority was running which was 12 weeks of boot camps X times per week and lost some weight really enjoyed life. (I was lucky enough to do the programme twice) but then politics got in the way and I didn’t feel welcome there. move tried joining gyms but I got X or X times. I always feel embarrassed. I got into running and ran a few ks but then I hurt my shoulder and I can’t get back going, I always feel embarrassed the minute I see someone else walking. ive been to the GP many times over the years and told them I feel like an alcoholic would but with food, I was referred to a lifestyle programme but it’s one where after a few weeks they don’t want to be seeing you every week. I went back to the GP and was givenn medication but that didn’t work either. I’ve also taken medication on and off over the years with no joy. I joined a different programme for X months and put on weight I paid to go private and see a physiatrist but after 3 appointments all he was getting me to do was fill in food diaries so I didn’t go back. I really don’t know what else to do, I feel like I’ll never beat this and no one will ever understand my problem or be able to help me. I have a young daughter and I’m embarrassed to be out with her, I go on any rides at theme parks with her and it’s horrible. I feel shame, I know I need to do something but I just can’t motivate myself to do anything. Has anyone ever known anyone this stupid and can anyone offer and advice? thank you",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/08/2020-6:29pm","Hi Antwire.Welcome to the forums!

To feel out of control of our life, and like there's nothing that we can do about it.  Plus the shame part too - That can't help matters either.So have you ever gotten hooked up with some binge eating groups ?  I'm sure that they must have some online.Just being able to talk with other people who are in the same boat, and not having to be alone with it…that could help make a difference I think ?",PaulShipmanSmith,"Wed,08/05/2020-12:23am","This has been a lifelong battle with food for you. In a way, you might be gaining comfort from your eating and maybe that all the foods you are eating coulbe be classed as 'comfort foods'. People comfort eat when they are stressed, depressed, hurt, embarrassed, ashamed, feeling guilty and the list could go on.... Much of your eating may occur in private – hence going to the shop, eating it all in the car and then going home to eat again. There is that secret element to this satisfying indulgence that will encourage within you a certain enjoyment. The question for you now is....How can you lose the weight, maintain that weight, increase your fitness and overcome your eating behaviours? There are many books, medications, therapies, treatments, fitness programmes....This list can go on. You successfully completed two 'boot camps'. However. What happens after that initial X weeks of intense diet and training? Then you might injure yourself running. As often happens, when an injury strikes it quickly puts a stop on the activity. You may benefit from different aveunues..... Consultation with an advisor. Fitness routine. Self help. Some psychological support. You could seek some dietary advice. You could benefit from a change in how you think and feel about yourself. Your struggles with you weight are not just about the physical side of things – but the mental state of mind as well. OK. When we embark on a diet and fitness campaign, we have these amazing expectations of ourselves. Feelings of guilt and shame can be associated with food and play a major part in the causes of our eating habits - especially any form of eating disorder. Some counselling may help you to explore your feelings of guilt and shame and may also help you to address the personal causes for your eating issues. Much of this can stem from life experiences. Changing how you think and feel about yourself may enable you to overcome those feelings of embarrassment and could be discussed in counselling. There are also books available on the subject of self-confidence. Having the motivation does take time and will power Admittedly. It's not easy, especially when you are trying to juggle it with your other life commitments. You'll learn that these changes may only at times be subtle, but can make a huge difference. What's more important is how you feel and value yourself - whatever the weight.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,08/05/2020-1:59pm","Hi PaulShipmanSmith, thanks for posting!

14,06/16/2020,Readytomovepastthis,mmartinez,"Hello I've been working on this problem for a while now. It has been over 3 years with bulimia on and off. Absolutely no-one knows about this situation of mine. I havent experienced any major problems because of this, but am exited to move past this. I am 18 years old and I am gay. I know this is not treatment, but am looking forward to talk to people on similar circumstances and hear advice and how you are dealing with it. I have a therapist and even having a deep trust in her I do not want to tell her about this since I dont feel comfortable with sharing any of this with her, since I am very concearned about not being able to go back to the US and continue college if I tell her. I really want support and advice on how to procede since going back to college if really important to me, and I would do everything possible for me to return. I know my parents will support me in every step of the way, but i'd rather not tell them for now. I think my bulimia is not that bad, since I could go from one to three weeks without purging  without purging, but it also comes in waves I could be fine for one or two months until it stikes again.",BobJ48,"Tue,06/16/2020-4:12pm","So what do you think the situation is, or the concerns are, that triggers you to purge?  ""I don't want to get fat"" is what a lot of people would say, but I mean emotionally deeper than that.  Like what would ""fat"" symbolize to you ?Some people might say ""It would mean that I'm not in control of my life.""Which is a different concern than ""fat"", if you follow what I mean ?",,,,,,,,,,,,
15,03/12/2020,SomehowLostAnImportantPhysiologicalFunction,hungrimahn635,"I have to say the least, a very unique situation. At some point along the line in my life, I've lost the ability to normally perceive hunger. Or maybe I've never had it to begin with, I cannot decide. A little bit of context may indicate some kind of answer to this: I have a physical disability known as Spina Bifida, of which spinal cord damages it has caused has lost some nerve functioning in the course of many incidents over the years. I've yet to act on this suspicion, if I even need to. I know fully well that this isn't normal, yet I don't see this to be a problem. Sure, I don't eat many snacks, and if left unattended I am at high risk of accidentally missing a meal(or two). However, it isn't like I don't feel the side effects of hunger;Usually when I am ""hungry"" and food is presented in front of me, I can gauge my hunger level by level of interest in food. Also, if I go without food long enough, I start to feel weak/faint and low energy. But, these are quite inconvenient and unconventional measures for hunger, and I am having second thoughts about themSo what do you all think? Is this as bad as part of me thinks it is? Any other thoughts?",BobJ48,"Mon,03/16/2020-6:19pm","Here's how I see things like this.   If they are getting in the way of your daily life, or are causing you to not function as well as you could, then that qualifies things as ""a problem"". When I was a very small child, I just didn't eat.  I didn't enjoy eating, and it seemed like a nuisance to me.  My mom took me to the doctor, but I was healthy, so he told her not to worry.  This went on for me well into adulthood, and I remained painfully thin.  I was still quite active though, so it never seemed like a big deal.   However there were repeated times when I would go out in my canoe for fishing, and I'd stay out for a pretty long time, and I'd notice how weak and addle-headed I would get.Golly, maybe it would help if I packed a lunch ?  So I tried that and what do you know - I was much more able to keep my wits about me.at the end of the day.   When I was doing extended physical activities , it turned out to be the same thing.   If I'd eat, I had more stamina and could do a lot better.So yeah, there are practical things about eating that can make life better I think. This is assuming that there's not some big psychological issue attached to eating of course,  which is something that you didn't mention ?",hungrimahn635,"Fri,03/27/2020-5:47pm","You're reply is reassuring - I am not the only who has dealt with this issue.I would second all of what you have said about the effects - I tend to get weak and listless when I don't eat. I just have been spooked since people around me can talk about food they feel like eating, and I don't exhibit same level of interest that everyone I've met has in food.I don't have any psychological problem with eating as far as I can tell. Food is just sustenance for me unless it is food I like. But even in the case of food I really love, I don't think about it unless it follows along with my daily 3-meals-a-day need, rarely is it out of strong personal desire. I never get ""hunger pangs"" or get even close to yearning for any food. I may suffer a lack of interest as time, but I am not perpetually/consistently adverse to food.In conclusion, this seems to be more abnormal but not a problem - it doesn't necessarily ""get in the way"" of my day-to-day life. It is no longer a cause for concern. Thank you for your insights, they were helpful.",,,,,,,,,
