0,10/10/2021,extremelyanxiousdaughter,pepper65,"Hi. I have an adult daughter who is extremely anxious about food (has been since she launched). She is anxious in general but worrying about food often keeps her from eating. Recently she confessed that she sometimes binge eats and feels she can't stop. She spoke as though this was a few years ago, but I didn't press. She has digestive problems and was put on an elimination diet by her doctor. Perhaps it helped a little bit, not much. But now she seems even more anxious about food and eating. I'm not sure if this is an eating disorder or not. To complicate things, she married about a year ago to a young guy who is a very bad example. He is still eating like you would expect a college kid to eat, any random thing that looks good, lots of junk food in the house, orders food delivered as his supper. Her anxiety has transferred to him and she's mad at him all the time. She seems unable to talk to him past a very superficial level. When I urge her to explain things to him she becomes hysterical. She is also always tired and seems depressed but she denies she is depressed.I don't even know where to start. I want to cook for her so she has healthy foods in the house that won't cause her the extreme constipation she sometimes suffers from. And also to relieve her  of worrying about being able to eat well enough. Her husband does not want me involved. He says he will take care of things but he absolutely does not. For example, he was going to make lunch for them today (there is very little in the house to eat except junk) but he watched the football game instead. I picked her up and took her to the grocery store and got her to choose some ready made foods that were not junk food. It was expensive but it will get her through the week.If I cook for her, it will cost much less and be more healthy. Am I wrong to do this? This downward spiral has been going on for over a year and I have watched her mental health deteriorating and am starting to get concerned about her physical health.She will be going to an EAP counselor in a couple of weeks. She gets 10 visits for free. I'm not sure what happens after that. In the past she has not been honest with counselors, so I don't know what will happen this time. I am in a lot of distress watching her deteriorate.",Tryingtoheal,"Tue,11/09/2021-12:57pm","There is no such thing as good or bad food.   That is diet mentality.   Professional help is best.  It sounds like the best place for her to be is in a hospital. Labeling food as good or bad is like saying ""junk food"" is bad; immoral.  All food serves a purpose.  It sounds like she needs more help than you're trying to give her.  Even if you get her what you deem as ""healthy"", or ""good"" or ""moral"", doesn't mean she'll eat.  Unfortunately you can't force recovery.  She has to want it in order for her to get better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,10/29/2021,BoneLossandRecoveryAssociatedwithAnorexia,kent24,"Hi,  Our daughter has been suffering from anorexia/orthorexia for approx 2 years now. Her weight dropped greatly and while she has recovered most of it back she is still in the grips of the disease. She has shown reduced bone density as exhibited in DEXA's done the past 2 years (3 done annually from July 19, 2019 - July 2021).  She also has a rare genetic affliction called Hypophosphatasia (HPP), which also can cause problems with bone density (although the symptoms shown by those suffering it vary widely from no symptoms to it being fatal in infants). I also have the disease and have never shown any signs of bone loss.  So, before blaming any bone loss on the HPP (and being resigned to a treatment regimen we are not in favor of) we are trying to get some specific information on bone loss and recovery associated with anorexia. My questions are 1) how long after the onset of anorexia does bone loss begin to be evident, 2) how long after gaining the weight lost by anorexia (i.e., back to the pre-anorexia weight) is it before the bone loss is reversed, and 3) how long would it take to get back to pre-anorexia density (if that is even possible)?  We have seen doctors, therapists, dietitians, etc., and I am not convinced that any of them really know these answers, and the easy way out is to simply agree with the geneticist who she is seeing for the HPP who simply blames it on the HPP and appears overly anxious to get my daughter into a study using this fairly new drug because there are so few patients in her category (as the disease is so rare).  Does anyone have any knowledge about this, or know where we could look?  Are any relevant reference works available? Some objective statistics would be great, but any thoughts anyone might have are welcome. I feel like just seeing another doctor isn't the answer.  Thanks! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,10/21/2021,Daughterstrugglingincurrenttreatment,HopeFaith2108,"Hello.  This is my first post.  My teenage daughter has been in a residential center only for a few days before they recommended she needed to go to a hospital for a feeding tube (via nose).  even though she was only at that center for 4 full days, she didn't eat any of her meals and barely drank water or supplemental drinks.  She's been bounced around with different therapists up to this point and residential was recommended as we tried virtual and that was not effective. I want her to go back to the residential because I feel consistency is key.  right now the dr's at hospital are focusing on her meds so she can be released and those thoughts go away.  You see my daughter's body image is distorted big time.  I want her to eat, she's still given meals at the hospital and she has been drinking her supplements but get the feeding through the tube at night as well.  I'm so worried and frustrated with doctors and the process.  I'm exhausted and wish there was something I could say so she knows that she will die if she doesn't eat.  She keeps saying she is okay but she isn't, I mean she's in a hospital. anyway here have experience with a child that had to have the feeding tube and how they came about removing it and finally eating?  I just want to hear from another parent...I'm alone.  Thank you so much.",BobJ48,"Wed,10/27/2021-4:36pm","One thing to remember about EDs is that people in your daughters position are going to be feeling that nobody really gets it about why she has to starve.  Because she does feel like she has to, or else…something bad is going to happen.  ""She'll get fat"" is her main concern, but ""getting fat"" is a stand-in for all sorts of other worries she has.  Plus she feels in control when she restricts, and feeling in control is a huge part of eating disorders.
So go to the hospital and they're going to force you to do every single thing that feels totally wrong to you.  Which is how you see recovery to be - you lose all of your sense of control, and everything that other people are going to try and force you to do feels absolutely wrong. Which who among us ever feels comfortable with that idea ?  No one that I know.
The folks at the treatment center aren't set up to deal with people who may be dying because they won't eat.  Imagine their legal situation if one of their clients died while they were supposedly taking care of them. So you can see why they'd want to ship someone off to the hospital in order to medically move them away from that possibility.
Having said all that, I can pretty much promise you that there's a part of your daughter that understands that she might be in trouble.  Sure, she still may want to push forward with her ED, and continues to view it as a positive thing.  But there's going to be another part of her that knows that it's not.  For one thing, just look at all the disruption it's caused for her, and the worry and concern that it causes for others. There's no way to spin any of that in a positive direction.
What it's going to take to turn things around is hard to say.  Guilt-tripping her is not going to help her feel better about herself, and the war-of-wills thing which can happen in treatment can be problematic as well.
So you'll have to see.  Her own decisions about things is what will make the ultimate difference. Rather than decisions that others try and impose on her.
Having said all that, the idea that you as her parent, would be open to hearing her real feelings in a sympathetic and non-judgmental way…that may help her feel more at ease.
Which people with EDs generally don't feel at ease in the least, so anything you can do along those lines is likely to work in her favor.
In any case, wishing the best for all of you. With EDs, when things are at this stage, it's rare that anyone feels good about anything, so try and keep a level head if you can, and see what you can do to take the moment-to-moment sorts of things in stride.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,10/07/2021,"We’renewtothesubject,lookingforadvice",lurch72,"My wife and I learned of this disorder just a few months ago, and our daughter is in a 6 week daily program that she seems to like.

In addition, heavy marijuana use over the past few years has led us to research Hyperemesis.The big picture question I have is this- how to know if an eating disorder was diagnosed correctly, vs. just an additional symptom of her anxiety?

- they cannot talk during meals
- they cannot stand up w/o permission
- no one talks in the groups
- she has not been given boxes and letters we’ve sent. I believe they are being held as incentives
- she has panic attacks and is ignoredI also found a Reddit entry by a past patient about this particular facility that says these things and more. The specialists we work with and others tell me my daughter’s ED is just trying to get out of there and she is trying to manipulate me. But she says her mental health is deteriorating in there. I’m so conflicted! Do any of you have experience with residential care?",BobJ48,"Mon,03/08/2021-6:42pm","I suspect it's going to be difficult to get a straight story.  When residential seems to be the only option, folks can be reluctant to badmouth treatment places.I do know from many years of reading people's self-reports about their treatment experiences (often from people who have often been in multiple programs) that some places do indeed seem to be better than others.""The specialists we work with and others tell me my daughter’s ED is just trying to get out of there and she is trying to manipulate me.""Again, it's hard to say.  Keep in mind the fact that some patients go in voluntarily, and are truly looking to get better, while other patients really do just want to just get the heck out of there and get back to their EDs.  What I mean is that a client's attitude can have a big influence in how they perceive their situation. One other thing to keep in mind is that it's not at all uncommon for new patients to completely freak out for the first 10 days or so. Frantic calls on the phone, talking about the horrors of their situation are not uncommon, so I'd withhold judgment for the first couple of weeks, and see how she feels about things then. But yes, despite the warm and glowing self-descriptions that almost every treatment place sets forth to the public, some places can be considerably more heavy-handed than others I think.

What you are hearing is your child’s disorder trying desperately to escape a place where it is being directly tackled!! DO NOT LISTEN!
they are not allowed to talk during meals likely because many patients would speak inappropriately about the food, or try to distract staff through conversation so they don’t have to eat.
They cannot stand without permission because many sufferers will have a standing compulsion (trying to burn calories)
People do not talk in groups because they are shy or scared: this is normal
The calorie talk and complaint about feeds  is clearly the ED talking.
As for the rest of her complaints: I believe her ED will be trying to demonise and portray the residential as far worse than it is!
stick to your guns, and please please don’t listen to the ED!!!! you are stronger than it, and your daughter is where she needs to be.

I have been in touch with a treatment facility who offers residential, IOP and PHP.  I am having absolute sticker shock about the cost of treatment after insurance covers.

I am devastated, and will never forgive myself for not learning more about this terrible illness. If I had known, now,  what I recently learned (over the past 8 months) I am sure she would still be alive. (She would definitely be struggling and the road to recovery would have been a difficult two years - if not longer - but she would be alive. I miss her every minute of every day. We were so, so close; until the last 8-9 months.  We fought, she lied, she hid the laxatives, and made promises that she never intended to keep.  Her brain had deteriorated, due to malnourishment, and her eating disorder became a severe mental illness. I was told, over and over, that she would die if she did not receive the help she needed; yet, the hospitals did not provide her with the help she needed. Our system is broken and anorexia is different for each person. There is no one way to treat it. (This is why we have so much difficulty helping anorexics.)I would suggest that you start reading articles and watching videos about this disease. You should read the book X.  EVERY doctor, nurse, and parent of an anorexic should read this book to understand the progression of this illness. (Obviously, family dynamics will differ from each family, but the way the main character deals with her anorexia will definitely send chills up your spine because you will relate to her behavior.While reading this book, you could share it with your mother, since you daughter is living with her. Somehow, you should try to make your mother understand that if something happens to your daughter she might feel guilty. You, your husband, and your mother should try to work together to develop a plan. Since your daughter is living with your mother, and you mentioned she is not working - it seems she is dependent upon your mother for shelter and food. If this is the case, ALL 3 of you need to develop a plan to get her some help. I hope your daughter either has some type of health care. If not, see what medical benefits she is entitled to and reach out and help her get what she can get. THEN, all three of you must sit down with your daughter and discuss how concerned you are, etc. Remember, the most difficult part is to remain calm. (My husband and I had handled all of this the wrong way - we were way too emotional - I didn't know how to handle it back then. Her behavior caused us so much stress. After her two severe hospitalizations in Aug. and Oct of 2019, we yelled at her all the time. Her behavior was so erratic and strange.  I later learned from the therapist who saw my daughter one time (and this therapist admitted telling my daughter that if she didn't leave our home, living with us would kill her!)before my daughter packed her bags and moved where no one could see her and led a life of lies about how she was gaining weight, etc. Remember, anorexics can be extremely smart, manipulative, and liars. COVID is the worst environment for anorexics.What I am trying to say, is that you need a plan of action of how you can get her to do what you want her to do so she can get the help she needs. (A few months after my daughter moved, my husband and I decided to try and lure her a promise of a studio apartment near my son's condo if she gained weight and kept it on for 3 months. She promised this and kept telling us she was gaining her weight.  We wanted her to reach a higher weight. When she left for Chicago she was under that weight. When I reached her place in Chicago, she weighed even less!)I think a problem parents face is being too emotionally involved.  We love our kids and will do anything for them, and I kept believing my daughter's lies. I wish I had read that book last year. I wish so many things.  (Ironically, I found this book among my daughter's things when cleaning her room.)I hope this helps you. Anorexia is a deadly disease and it takes a lot of strength to help those affected by it. I kept thinking that my daughter was old enough to decide if she wanted to gain weight or not, but it isn't that easy. Because anorexia is both physical and mental, both types of treatment are needed for success. It is so difficult for anorexics who are 18 years or older to go for help. We pleaded with our daughter for 8 years. It only became worse.I hope you are able to take away some advice from my response. I will be thinking of you.",marty2020,"Sat,10/17/2020-10:24am","I hope the forums have been providing some support for you.

My heart goes out to every parent who is trying to keep their child going one day at a time.  We went to treatment centers, therapists, nutritionists and nothing worked.  If anything, working with ""specialists"" made her more resentful and made her dig her heels in more.  What worked for her was getting to the point where she had such alarming chest pain that it scared her so bad that she wanted to turn her life around.  She no longer wanted to live like this.  Having said this, she was full of disdain for ""trained professionals"" who had no idea how she was feeling or what she was going through.  She sought out people who shared their story online who had beaten this dreadful disease so they knew exactly what she was going through.  In her mind, they were the experts.  I would say she has been trying to recover for about two years now.  And as hard as it is to live with someone with an eating disorder, the recovery journey is just as hard, if not harder for the person suffering with the disease.  This is where she gets comfort from learning from people who have been through this.  My daughter is sharing her experience online now because she wants other people suffering with this disease to know that they are not alone.  She gets messages from people who say ""I ate dinner tonight because of you,"" or ""I am one month into recovery and I am following your progress and you are what keeps me going.""  Maybe try and steer your daughter towards finding someone who she can relate to who has turned her life around.  It has been a long road, X lbs of weight gain but my daughter looks amazing and healthy.  She said this morning for the first time, ""you know, I actually don't hate my body anymore.""  She has been weight-restored for a while but we are seeing signs of the neural re-wiring in the brain.  I wanted to cry when she said that this morning.

15,06/25/2021,AdultDaughterSufferingFromFoodAvoidanceED,august41,"My 24 year old daughter, who has lived in another state for the past four years, has returned home with a relapse of anorexia, taking the form of food avoidance and texture issues. In the past, she has been treated for anxiety and depression, with both medication and therapy. She left home to attend school, living with boyfriend. Her relationship (thankfully) ended and she lived on her own for some time, then quit attending school without informing us (she was in a cosmetology program), so all the money we had invested was gone. She began a new relationship, which seemed great, made a single semester stab at college, then moved to another state with boyfriend. The relapse with food issues began off/on last summer, after she had been prescribed a medication for depression/anxiety. She read this medication also can suppress your appetite, so she discontinued it and therapy. Things have gone downhill from there. Her relationship has deteriorated, not only due to her issues, but her boyfriend's controlling and verbally abusive behavior, which really intensified her eating problems. I finally told her to leave and come back to our home, as that was clearly a toxic environment for her. She's been here two weeks. She has always been on the slender size, but is currently less than her normal weight.. She does not NOT eat, but she says at times she'll spend a long time just trying to get herself to eat something. If I cook a meal, she'll eat it. She doesn't purge, she sees her body clearly as it is. We are looking at the best way to get her treatment now and residential seems out of reach financially, even with insurance. We're trying to find counselors to treat her, but she keeps rejecting everyone because she says (based on online info) that they don't have experience with her specific type of ED. On top of all this, she's floundering in terms of knowing what she wants to do with her life in terms of career, boyfriend will not leave her alone, she's conflicted about the relationship - basically, a ton of bricks. I'm unsure of how to move forward with her. She's welcome to stay in our home and receive treatment here, but past issues have made us impatient with her. In the past, she's gone through psychiatric treatment and therapy and didn't following through with it. The ED in the past seemed to be a component of anxiety problems and was helped by treatment for that. She was put into an involuntary psychiatric hold after cutting herself so badly it required a trip to hospital for treatment. That was a nightmare that did more harm than good. She no longer cuts. To add to this, I have a very elderly parent who is requiring more care, a husband who is on dialysis for kidney failure and another child with substance abuse issues. I am a little uninformed about this type of ED as it is not what I have heard about in the past and feel overwhelmed. My daughter is willing and anxious to get treatment, but her past behavior has made me expect she won't follow through with it. I'm overwhelmed and unsure how to find the right treatment that is affordable and accessible. Any advice is welcome.

I am new to this and trying to figure out how to manage.  My daughter is 12 and has anorexia.  Her ED therapist has recommended residential treatment, as my daughter is really struggling.  It seems we may be on a 4 to 6 week wait to get her into a center, and I am terrified we won't be able to manage keeping her going that long on a basic survival kind-of basis.

19,03/05/2021,Howlongcansheliveonnutritiondrinks?,Maare,"New here and first post. My 15 year old daughter was diagnosed with restrictive anorexia about a month ago. We knew things where going down hill at Christmas. She has been working out and getting in phenomenal shape since last spring. Eating healthy but always eating enough. She was counting calories but always maintained weight. She actually was counting calories so she could eat what she needed to build muscle. She is an amazing volley ball player and came into 9th grade strong as an ox. December came and she got mono. She lost weight because of it and it spiraled her very quickly into very restrictive eating. Long story short she just came out of children's hospital 2 days ago after a 13 day stay and a beginning of a re feeding program. The stay was brutal, but by the end she was eating most meals and came home on a high calorie meal plan. Yesterday she ate half of breakfast and half of lunch. Since then has refused all food. The rages and yelling have stopped, she just sits for the half an hour and just stares, doesn't eat anything, then I give her the supplement and she drinks it in a few minutes and goes back to the couch. doesn't speak to me or anyone unless its to tell me she hates me or i should burn in hell. How long should I let her just drink the supplement beverage? literally today she drank all her calories in beverage form. when do I push and say she can't have it and must eat? and if she refuses? I hate that its the weekend and I can't get a hold of her team at children's hospital. I have to wait til Monday. do i make her sit until she eats solid food or just be happy that shes drinking the supplement?",_admin_moderator,"Mon,03/08/2021-12:59am","Hi Maare, welcome to the forums.

What brought this on is hard to say, but kids can be really sensitive at her age.  Some kind of bullying comment from someone at school about her appearance - often it doesn't take much to set things off. And imagine how the hospital must have felt to her.  Here she was, exerting all this self-discipline, and (successfully!) seeing herself get thinner, and suddenly she's put in a position where all of her control has been stripped away from her, and strangers are forcing her to do things which absolutely feel wrong. It must have felt completely traumatic, and it sounds to me like she may still stunned by the whole thing.And now she's expected to repeat the whole thing on her own ?  So yes, what to do ?  It's probably not fair to try and discount her experience, or say that everything's going to be fine.  Hopefully the treatment team will have some suggestions.In the mean time though, yes, it's good that she's at least willing to drink the supplement.  That really does count as something.Just keep an eye on her for a while after she drinks it would be my suggestion.

21,02/07/2021,Parentalinvolvement,The_Dad,"Thanks to all in advance,Our 18yo daughter has wrestled with anorexia for a little more than a year now and is currently being treated within a residential facility, which we are very thankful for. It is, at least as best we can tell today, her and our best path forward.She also suffers from a severe restrictive disorder and the house's no option for food choices has presented her with challenges that exceed, by a wide margin, her anorexia within that setting. She is struggling through it (with drugs it seems).One of the things that we as parents have struggled with is the apparent removal from her treatment process over the past year. We only want what is best for her obviously but we are at a loss to explain and understand why her counselors at her previous treatment program and now her residential program appear to say that parents are a very important part of the treatment process and then *appear* to try to reduce parental understanding of what is happening most of the rest of the time. I understand that somethings are best to remain confidential, and I fully support that concept, but Im at a loss why (for example) the caregivers at her residential facility do not want to learn more about our daughters experiences to date from us. They indicate (to us) that they receive that information from our daughter, but surely they know that ED behavior includes lying through their teeth about whatever they can for the benefit of the disorder. They will only accept consent from a person who is clearly not able to provide it.Its as bad as kids getting released from the same program that she is in without any go-home plan. Some parents are not told if the patient has eaten or not, what they are eating or even what the plan should be to carry on the treatment within the home setting.Its very easy to point fingers and become paranoid about what appears to be the cutting off of communication between the patient and the parents, but we will never and are not doing that. I have total confidence that her program has her best interest in mind with all of their actions, but I just wish that someone would tell us. Surely it is something like:1) We have found that increased independence from family facilitates recovery, or
2) There are good and bad days and the reality is that you cant do anything to help the bad days, so we are trying to give you the rest that you need so that you're able to carry on when she comes home, or
3) She has requested that you not be part of her treatment, or
4) We find if too much communication goes home that we have to deal with back-seat driving parents and that takes away from the resources we need to treat your loved ones.We do not care what the reason is - nor do we doubt whatever rationale its based upon - but does someone know why this happens? We have been on zoom calls with parents of other girls getting treated and this seems a universal approach - everyone seems to feel that they are being completely shut out of the process - some even pick up their girls from the facility without a plan for what to do the next day! It seems so inefficient at best but at worst brings high probability of taking steps backward once the girls are back at home.There has to be a reason for this - I wish someone could just say it!",SDmom,"Tue,02/16/2021-10:17am",Your daughter is in one type of program. There are other programs out there that use FBT or Family-based Therapy. It sounds like that is what you want to try.,The_Dad,"Tue,02/23/2021-2:36am","Thanks for the reply - this is indeed ""family based therapy"" which is why its so confusing to many. This is the third FBT program we have been in and they're all the same - poor communication between the program and the family. Its a poor set up. The programs require the heavy lifting to be done at home (and it is torturous as Im sure you are aware, unfortunately) but provide absolutely no feedback and leave the families guessing what to do. Its very strange.Update: my daughter was discharged from the residence just one week into her 8week stay for being unable to meet the rules of the house. She also suffers from ARFID and is unable to eat 90% of the foods that were presented -supplementing  was allowed but it still sent her into abrupt panic attacks that were severe enough that she ended up vomiting (which is against house rules for obvious reasons). Big set back as she was trying her very best to align and was discharged for the involuntary behavior of struggling with her ED.We received the call that she was discharged and to come and pick her up 5 days ago. NOT A SINGLE FOLLOW UP CALL FROM HER PREVIOUS CARE PROVIDERS TO DEBRIEF AS TO WHY SHE WAS EJECTED OR TO ADVISE ON NEXT STEPS OR ANY GUIDANCE AT ALL. ""Come pick her up"" was the last we heard. ED centers need to do better. She quit school and her job to attend this center who dumped her for struggling with the ED she was there asking for help to deal with, without so much as a single follow up to see how she is doing or to help in anyway with the plan. We deeply regret her stay at this location because it really has made things much worse.",BobJ48,"Tue,02/23/2021-2:57pm","Boy, I'm sorry you had such a lousy experience with this residential outfit.  One can certainly start questioning where their commitments lie, that's for sure, when you know that they understand full-well that their actions have only made the person's situation worse, and haven't helped your attitude as a parent either. It's hard to know what you should tell your daughter about this.  One would hope there would have been some follow-up from the program to help you with this.  For what it's worth, there are some treatment-provider review sites on the web that you might want to search out, and leave a review of your experience with them.The fact that your daughter was willing to quit school and her job in order to get help is still something positive though, even if all she got was a poke in the eye from this place for her efforts.  If it were me, I'd advise you to keep trying to find a place for her, rather than allowing this experience to cause you to give up.  One way you might get a better idea of what certain programs are like is to check out those websites where employees can leave feedback on what it's like to work at various companies.  I've done that before for various ED treatment facilities, and the information I've found has often been…informative.",SDmom,"Wed,03/03/2021-2:57pm","Did you try family-based at home with help from ED specialist, dietician, and family therapist? It is the Maudsley Approach and is done 100% at home--except for visits to your outpatient team (unless it's all virtual due to COVID). If your daughter wants to recover and is willing to try it. You become the residential. It's VERY hard but it works for some families. We tried it, and it was going well for weeks but my daughter started binging/purging at night and rejecting her meals...among other problems. We did learn a ton if we ever choose to reboot and go that route again. There is a ton of preparation that has to go into it before you even begin: setting up a contract with your child,  a consequence/reward structure, finding an ED specialist who specializes in FBT, etc. etc. One of our big mistakes was not taking away all privileges, which could be earned back gradually by eating. We were not prepared and informed enough on it to be successful. I would approach it very differently and be much more prepared ....like you are training for the fight of your life...before launching into it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,01/02/2021,Comorbidities,soosan,"Bulimia, substance abuse, self-harm, an abusive boyfriend, promiscuity, lying, other risky behaviors. This list, which seems a many-headed mythological monster, defines my nineteen-year-old daughter's past year. Although these horrors appeared to hit us like a surprise sledgehammer, they were lying in wait for quite a while. My darling, bright, funny girl, the one I've treasured and guided since before she was born is mostly unrecognizable these days. I feel as if I've spent the year mourning her disappearance and doing my best to help and live with this often belligerent, vacant stranger. Once in a while, I catch glimpses of that lovely girl I've known, but these moments are fleeting. I have wondered if she suffers a personality disorder, but as she is considered an adult, I have no way of conferring with her therapist.My daughter struggled earlier on with bullying, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsion and has been willingly seeing therapists since middle school. I prayed that this, along with the time I've spent with her over the years, lifting her up and encouraging her, would somehow shield her from such darkness. I was wrong. I spend my days worrying, being hopeful, crying, trying to take care of myself, and trying to take care of her when she lets me.The other day, after her boyfriend (who may be a sociopath) disappeared during the holidays (and, unfortunately, reappeared afterward with no explanation or apology), she seemed at a turning point, at least in regard to self-care and leaving that toxic relationship. For a day or two, she looked and sounded healthier than I've seen her in a very long time. She was present and was cutting down on harmful behaviors. We talked and talked and talked, without her getting angry at what I had to say. My heart lifted. As soon as her boyfriend reappeared, though, she flew back to him and lost the life in her eyes. Though we are living together, we've spoken few words since he reappeared. My current quiet is neither a reflection of anger nor disappointment in her; it is despair. What is there to say, really? Instead I hug her and ask if she'd like some tea.Though her bulimia is not my only concern, it is one of the more immediately life-threatening. Each horror seems to be tied into the rest, so much that talking to, helping her with one means addressing some of the others. I have to time my attempts well, at the risk of her shutting me out. Talking about her bulimia seems to provoke the most anger, so I am careful with it.She is a college student and plans to head back to school in a couple weeks. I don't know how she did it, but she managed excellent grades this past semester. Part of me wants to keep her home for the spring, but the other part, the beaten-down part, is relieved at the idea of her going. I realize therapy would help me, as well, but I am barely affording her care.As I type this, I wonder what it is, exactly, I am looking for by posting. Perhaps I wonder if there is anyone out there who is experiencing such a storm. I realize an eating disorder, alone, is storm enough. My exhaustion, worry, and heartache often leave me wanting for neat, organized thoughts on the matter of my daughter, as if a map of her life, of my life could be drawn that would leave me without trailing caveats, without questions. At this point, she and I seem to be at the mercy of a miracle.Thanks for listening. Peace.",SDmom,"Thu,02/18/2021-1:15pm","soosan, my heart goes out to you. You are a strong woman, who is suffering greatly. I can relate in small regard since my daughter has ODD and possibly BPD in conjunction with her ED. It's exhausting and brutal. I've heard that NAMI has a good program for parents. I am so immersed in ED treatment right now that I haven't reached out, but as soon as my daughter is in PHP I will. I look forward to the family therapy that the PHP program offers and getting my daughter into dialectal behavior therapy and meds--I think that is her only hope for a somewhat ""normal"" life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Getting my daughter into weekly pediatrician visits was the first step. The pediatrician and I talked in advance. The next step was getting her working with an ED specialist, not any other kind of therapist, but one whose primary focus is EDs, especially in teens. This all came to a head with hospitalization mandated by her pediatrician before real ED therapy w dietician could begin. Next step was refeeding in the hospital, because of the effect of malnutrition on her brain, weight restoration had to happen quickly and asap. The ED thrives in the malnourished brain, which is said to shrink up to 20%. From hospital, she should have gone to PHP or residential, but due to COVID there are long waitlists everywhere. So we brought her home intending to do the Maudsley Method or FBT. For 3-4 weeks it went pretty darn well, she had significant gains and got her period (only once so far). Now 6 weeks in and still waiting for PHP, she is backsliding. Anyway...I hope this offers some help to know the experience of others.

My daughter has been suffering from bulimia and anorexia since about age 12 and is now 20-years-old.Throughout, she has binged and purged in her bedroom--I have most literally done everything I can to end this cycle and she has been through inpatient and IOP treatment for months at a time twice.When I find her behaviors, which is often, I confront her and tell her she needs to stop doing this. Sometimes she does and sometimes she doesn't. She won't. I won't go into all that I've done to try and change this behavior and get her to take being in recovery seriously, but it has been extensive and all-consuming (yes, I probably need to learn to let go and accept there is little I can do).Does anyone else have experience with this behavior?

I don't know that I have any good suggestions for you, as I am in the thick of a similar situation with my daughter. Certain approaches on my part are effective only on certain days; it seems there is no one successful prescribed path for a parent of a suffering child. It is indeed all-consuming. I do believe that maintaining loving and open communication with your daughter is vital (though not always easy). There have been times my daughter has shut me out completely, which I calmly accept, indicating I will be there for her. She always comes back. Ultimately, though, it seems they have to WANT to get better, to get help. You can only do so much. I have a daily conversation with myself about this, which is exhausting. I also try to remember to take care of myself, to find physical and emotional outlets, to breathe. Being outside, listening to music, spending time with our pets (among other things) can be healing, even if temporary. Your well-being is essential.This is all just to say that you are heard and you are not alone. The fact that you posted here says much. Hold on and take good care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,12/22/2020,WhentoforcePHPorresidential,SDmom,"Past sufferers and parents,
My daughter has been doing ED behaviors for 1.5 yrs-- starting w binging, moving to binge/purge, then restricting and currently very low BMI.I've tried talking to her about 6 times over the past year after reading how to do that on NEDA. It is ALWAYS met with denial and now rage. She is currently seeing an ED specialist for depression and anxiety--since she won't admit ED. They are trying to do it in a round-about way. She is not honest with the specialist about purging or restricting. She told me she would lie to a dietician. She recently dropped more weight. When do you force a defiant, strong-willed teen into PHP or residential? I'm afraid it will backfire. Please help! I'm so scared, and I feel totally ineffective as a parent.",Annet,"Sun,12/27/2020-11:02pm","I am not a worried parent but I was the daughter of some worried parents some time back.
Although I did not recognize I had a problem at first, there was a moment in my life when I did and I sought for treatment on my own.
My parents did several attempts that did not work. The sufferer needs to bottom out in order to react and accept treatment. It is then, when you are able to make significative changes.
I know sometimes, it is required to force people into treatment (especially when their lives are in danger). However, I firmly believe that complete recovery can only happen until the person is ready. Before that, people only keeps themselves ""alive"" and at the minimum weight that can keep them ""out of hospital"". But they will continue to secretly struggle with their ED. Other times, they become ""functional"" but are not able to live a full recovered life.Cheers with your daughter.

26,06/06/2020,24yearolddaughterhomeforCovid-19,Fuji1999,"Good morning,
Our daughter came home for Shelter in Place mid-march and during the past 3 months her eating disorder has progressed to the point where she is isolating in her room, door closed, only coming out twice a day to eat. She gets food quickly from the kitchen and retreats to her room to eat. She is severely restricting, eating as little as possible. She is severely underweight.
We, her parents, are going to tell her that we want her to see a medical doctor because we are concerned about her health. If she refuses, we are going to tell her she cannot stay here any longer, as we cannot participate in her destruction.
Has anyone else done this? Taken a hard-line such as this with the hope that the sufferer seeks help? We don't know what to do. She is angry, isolated, lethargic, and refuses to speak to us. Please, if anyone has had a similar situation, what did you do? She is not under any therapy at this point, though we are going to encourage that.",BobJ48,"Sun,06/07/2020-2:36am","I'm on a board for people with EDs, and with the lockdown a lot of people are retreating. It's hard to tell if they are glad about it or not.  Mostly not I think, but as you said, they can use the time for ED. And they know what they are doing. Even if she is pushing forward, and being angry and irritated, it's also  possible that she's not happy about it. But when people have eating disorders, they act like people who have eating disorders do, even if they are not overjoyed.  It's tough one both sides.Which…she probably understands that part too.  So it's easy for things to turn into a stalemate.I'm not sure what to tell you. I can't give you any advice on making her move out.  But I think you could ask her what her plan is.  If you can do it in a way that shows you understand that she wonders too.  Because she most likely does. NEDA has a bunch of parental resources and educational things you can check out. But yes,  EDs can cast an evil spell, and are  difficult for everyone involved.",Fuji1999,"Tue,06/16/2020-9:57pm","Thank you for your response. We did not know she had an eating disorder before this, but it is very apparent now. She is very angry, very hostile towards us, and as crazy as it sounds, we are afraid to confront her because we know the explosion that will follow. How pathetic is that?! What do you think of sharing with her the symptoms and the consequences of anorexia? That is, I am not sure she realizes the damage she is doing to her body and to her mind. Perhaps now she won't care, but in the future, maybe she will reflect on that and it would help her get some support.",sdspeach,"Mon,02/01/2021-1:15pm","While it might be ""pathetic"" it is a reality we have experienced in confronting our daughter who has an eating disorder, medically diagnosed by a Dr who specializes in Eating Disorder.  Our daughter refuses to go to treatment.  She admits she has the eating disorder and shares that it is indeed a struggle for her.  She has agreed to see a Psychologist with ED credentials.  It is  a start.",brutus94,"Thu,06/18/2020-4:30pm","My daughter is 20 and has been dealing with an ED for 3+ years.  I have spent a lot of time lecturing, pleading, fighting, and avoiding the topic with my daughter.  The cycle of hope, sadness, depression, and anger is a real thing (for both the parent and the kid).  So I understand what you are describing very very well, unfortunately.We finally told our daughter we would no longer give her money for college unless she got the help she needed.  She made that deal with us prior to her first year of college, which she completed, but her health declined.  So, we said no more money.  It took a year to really kick in (about 6 months for her to realize we were serious, and another 6 months to find a program to go to).  So in the grand scheme, she has missed this last year of college.  But, I'm happy to report she is finally getting the help she needs, and she made the decision to go to a residential treatment program on her own.  Her motivation is to get back to school (which she LOVES), so that has worked.  At the end of the day, the beauty of this is that we didn't have to force her or argue with her, we just didn't write a check.  Unfortunately, it took us awhile to find a ""pain point"" that 1) motivated her and 2) we could implement without fighting.  One key here is that we did not forbid her to go back to school......she was free to go back and pay for it all on her own, but we knew that was pretty unlikely.So back to your question......I don't know if kicking her out is the right answer or not, but we did seriously consider it.  Other ideas we considered were taking away the car and taking away the phone.  In the end, college money seemed to be the best option for us.  It was emotionally hard to do, but I was 100% certain it was both right and fair.  I am hopefully the progress continues and she can manage things better going forward, but it will always be a struggle for her.Over the years my wife and I spent alot of time beating ourselves up over this entire situation, so let me also offer you some encouragement.  This is not your fault and you are not a bad parent.  And your daughter is not a bad/mean person either, she is just suffering from a very difficult and frustrating illness.  In fact, kudos to for doing your homework, looking for answers, and trying to help your daughter.  In the end, we had to realize that WE could not fix it.  WE could not MAKE her do anything.  They have to choose to fight.  I wish you and your daughter the best...…..and make sure you take care of yourselves too!",Fuji1999,"Sat,06/20/2020-7:41pm","Thank you for your response. Our middle daughter also had an ED, orthorexia (she was a competitive swimmer), and it took her a year of outpatient to finally decide she wanted to get better.

This older daughter has anorexia (restricting), and has the whole self-loathing, guilt, and so on that is common with ED. We know we need to confront her (we suggested that she see a doctor for a physical and she flipped out), but her anger keeps us from speaking up. We will, though.

She has been anorexic and obese and anorexic and obese.She also suffers from bipolar. She is very intelligent - law school graduate. What to do? She has admitted binge eating a whole cake. She never feels satieted. I am worried about her health. As a teen she asked for a personal trainer. We got her one. She started running and working out and dropped weight and looked very healthy, then the obsession kicked in and she became anorexic. A couple years later it was the other extreme with binging and excessive weight gain in a short period of time. She has lost her gall bladder as a result of the excessive overeating and quick weight loss. I am not sure if it is appropriate, but I want to order her some self-help books. At the risk of butting in, I feel that I need to offer something because I love her. She sees a psychiatrist for anxiety and bipolar but I don't think they even talk about the overeating.

28,01/01/2021,Adultchildwon’teat,Dneill79,"My daughter was a bottomless pit as a child. She ate everything in sight. She came home one summer after being at her father’s and said she wasn’t allowed to eat there—couldn’t have seconds, couldn’t help herself to the cupboards, etc.  Then when she was 15 she wanted to live with her dad. I let her, after so many struggles. She started fainting there. Then after a year, she went to live with my sister. My sister said she would hardly ever eat. She had to force her to eat. She fainted there, too. Then after a year, she went to live with her stepmom. She fainted there, too.  After a year, she came back to live with me. I cook, but not all the time. She’s very picky. If I make something she doesn’t want, she’ll storm in her room and say, “I guess I’ll starve.”  I have gone out of my way to buy food that she asks for. Usually, the food goes bad or just sits in the cupboard because she doesn’t “feel like eating that food anymore.”  The stress was getting to me. I was constantly worried I wouldn’t fix the food she wanted or worried that because we have leftovers, she won’t eat. So I had her stay at my dad’s house for a few days. He had a car he was going to give her  to motivate her to get a job. (She’s 18 and never had a job.) He wasn’t able to get it registered in her name, so she was in a bad mood when she came home. She said she was making a grocery list so she can have food she will actually eat, said grandpa had food she could eat. I asked what food. She told me and said “he actually cooked for us when we told him we were hungry. I’m tired of looking anorexic.”  I said, “you can’t blame me for you not eating.”  She said yes she can. My husband defended me and told her not to blame me for her choices. She got mad and went in her room, slammed the door, and called her friend to pick her up. She texted me and said she’s never coming back, said I’m a horrible mother for not doing things for her, for not cooking, etc.  Obviously I cook. I post new recipes I’ve tried on instagram all the time. I feel like there is a deeper issue here, but I don’t know what it is. Whatever I say to her, she twists my words and says completely the opposite of what the truth is.  I don’t know if she wants me to hand-feed her like a baby or what.",_admin_moderator,"Sat,01/02/2021-10:16am","Hi Dneill79, Welcome to the forums!

We are beginning treatment next week, but I feel like I am losing my mind when she eats so little. I have personally suffered from bulimia so I know that the disorder is screaming at her that she can't eat more and I also know that I can't force her to eat more because it will make her feel like she is ashamed or angry or whatever. But I spend nearly every waking moment feeling like I'm going to be sick because she is so thin and the amount she eats is barely enough to sustain life. If I leave her alone, she acts much like her normal self but it's eating me alive to stay back. How do you handle the emotions that are so overwhelming? Her siblings are angry with her because they blame her for making me cry so much. I've talked with them about how she isn't choosing to feel the way she does and that her mind is not well right now. They've definitely improved, but I want to stop myself from being so emotional all day long. I do go to a therapist myself, but after talking and feeling better when I get home, I see her with the tiny portion of food on her plate and my heart is ripped open again.

It is incredibly disturbing to see this going on and not be able to do anything to change it. Starting treatment should give you some peace of mind. I feel like she is the only one who can decide to get better; all I can do is provide the tools (therapy) and do what the specialists tell me. We just started with outpatient therapy, so I have not received much coaching yet. My husband is good at reminding me that this is one hurdle she will face in life...not to downplay its seriousness, but to remind me not to let it consume me. She is a challenging person and we will always have challenges with her. Reading the posts from recovered sufferers helps too. Taking deep diaphragmatic breaths often in a series of 3-4 and meditation help me. Maybe journaling will help get some of those emotions out.

However, there is a moment in life when you realize you want to change and you change. You get open to treatment and show real improvements.What can you do for now if it is still not their time to change?Let them know that you are worried about their health and wellbeing and if they ever need a listening ear, they can count on you.
Avoid any comments related to diets, people overweight, body image, etc.
Let her you know love her for what she is and not for the way she looks like.
Be an example of a healthy relationship with food and exercise.
Don't play a ""police-role"" at meal times. That will only make things worse.I am in recovery from an ED for I do not know what number of times and I have become pretty aware of the way ""normal people"" eat.

You all could be writing my daughter's story. She's been in and out of treatment but never committed to giving up her ED. And now I hear her purging, her room is littered with empty junk food containers and she will not be honest with me or herself. In fact, dishonesty is such a key trademark of this disease.At any rate, she's 20, so I can't do more than love and encourage her to seek support and to want recovery. I try my best.And in the meanwhile, I work very hard at keeping perspective that she has a number of good things n her life that weren't there before and so hopefully if she keeps building a life she likes (perhaps loves) that she will want to keep it and do what she needs to get into a sustained recovery.Best,

31,11/11/2020,Daughterdenyingobvious,SDmom,"Hello, I'm looking for any advice from people in recovery or from parents who have been where we are. My 15 yr old started binging and purging about a year ago after a summer of binging and gaining. We talked to her therapist and had been monitoring. I talked to her (after reading how to do that) about the signs and our concerns. She completely denied. As things continued, I approached her again, each time she grew increasingly angry and threatening (""you will give me a disorder""). Around August 2020, just after her yearly physical, she stopped eating and dropped significant weight within 3 months. When I brought it up she would get in a rage and tell me things like ""You want me to be sick, you have the problem, you are mean, you wouldn't say this if I was overweight, you are skinny-shaming me, you make me feel bad about myself."" I had to trick her into going to doctor for weight about 2 weeks ago, because she kept denying weight loss. She is medically stable, but now being monitored due to BMI. It's a total battle and she continues her tirade toward me. My husband and I sat her down a few day ago and, with the ammo of her recent weight loss, and expressed our concerns. She blamed the weight loss on depression--which I'm sure is intertwined--but she knows full well she has an ED. We got her back to dr. on Monday and her weight was same (2 wks later). We got her to agree to go back to her old therapist--who is not an ED specialist but a very experienced MFT, who has rapport with her. My daughter has ODD--so is extremely quick to anger, defiant, and impulsive. Our experience is that if you push her against her will, it backfires. For instance, when she was 13 she wanted to pierce her nose. We discussed and agreed she would wait until high school. One night she decided she wanted it right away. I told her we already discussed and she needed to wait, and I wasn't going to talk about it now because it's late (11 pm). I said goodnight, and she went straight into the bathroom and pierced her own nose with a safety pin. Questions:
How do we handle her showers after eating? She goes in the bathroom and turns music on loud. I have talked with her about this and how I think she is purging. She denies and says the showers help her relax. Do we force meals and snacks. Our family dinners have suffered as our kids (1 older brother) have become teens and involved in sports, working, etc. She usually only eats once a day when she eats. She won't eat with us. When do we tell her ""We know you have an ED whether you admit it or not and you need to start taking steps to help yourself or there will be consequences."" It is 100% clear she is not ready, does not want help, and will NOT admit to an ED. My greatest fear is pushing her and having her get worse or do something impulsive. Do we just see how the therapy goes and continue monitoring before taking the next step--forcing higher level of treatment and habits at home?Thank you so much for any suggestions or experience you can offer.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,11/12/2020-4:13pm","We are so sorry to hear about the struggles your daughter and family are having.

This could be my daughter. Unfortunately, anger, denial, and incredible dishonesty are all part of the disease. So frustrating.One thing I would recommend is not to think of information as ammo. With the dishonesty and anger that comes with this it is very easy to fall into an us versus her mindset or to think like a lawyer presenting a case. However, this will push her away.As to your questions:The shower is issue is common and there should be rules around it, but they should be made with her therapist or, ideally, with her ED treatment case manager. And she should agree to them. Forcing her to accept rules will force her to become even more dishonest.Don't force food on her or to take meals. Again, work collaboratively with an expert.Do be honest and do look at information on this site about how to speak with your daughter. Using the right language and mindset, as I've learned repeatedly with my daughter, makes all the difference.I'm also in a similar situation where after being in and out of treatment, my daughter still uses ED behaviors. I want her to get support but she refuses while lying to be and getting angry, etc.All I know is that I won't cure her or treat her.

First, it's so helpful to know others have a similar situation. Second, your point about ""ammo"" is well-taken; I have to stop thinking this way--which is trying to get her to acknowledge the problem. I guess I struggle with ""how can she deny it and not agree to getting help if we tell her we've seen this and this and this."" We got her seeing a specialist, who is part of a private ED treatment group ($$$), once weekly, but for depression and anxiety, which she is open about. We have to talk with our daughter today, because she is supposed to start getting weighed once weekly as well so that they can monitor that during her therapy. This is bound to lead to another huge blow-up. I feel like I need a specialist to move in with me and coach me daily!! My biggest question is still when do you force treatment--like PHP or residential--on someone who won't admit to the ED but knows full well she has an ED?

32,12/19/2020,DayTreatmentFacilitiesquestion,worriedmama,"Hello everyone! I hope you all can help me with this. My 21 year old daughter has recently come forward and admitted she needed help with her eating disorder. We recently found out 'how bad' things were and after some examinations, it seems that a treatment center is going to be the best thing for her. She suffers severely from anxiety/panic attacks as well and I am hoping that this type of treatment can help her. I am beside myself with grief that she is struggling so badly and has been hiding it for so long. Now that she has ""come out"", she is overwhelmed and exhausted. She, on her own, did some research and found this center in New York that has a day treatment program (virtual due to Covid). She fell ""in love"" with the place as they seem to do more than just ""therapy"" including things like yoga, art therapy, etc. She has talked with the counselors (we have as well) and has started with a nutritionist. She has had a medical evaluation and it is the center's suggestion that she do a full time day treatment program (5 days a week, all day) for at least a month and then downgrade (potentially) to a nightly/weekend program.    The center does NOT accept insurance and is very expensive. In the beginning we talked with my insurance company and they said that after we hit our VERY large out of pocket maximum, they would pay 100% of the bills.  Now, as we are two weeks away from her starting the program, we find out that although the insurance company does pay 100%, they only pay 100% of the ""fee scheduled rate"" which is about 10% of their actual fee. We would be responsible for the rest. SO, we basically can only afford 4 weeks of the program she wants to go to before we would have to switch her to someplace else.My question is this: Does anyone know if it is better to start the program in the place she wants and then transfer her to someone where else after the 20 sessions OR is it better to start at the 'other place' (the one that is in-network)My daughter is determined to go to her original find and does not want to consider starting somewhere else first. I am concerned that if she loves the program she picked, it may be really hard for her to re-adjust to a new center.Has anyone had this experience or can offer any guidance?  Thanks for listening!",marty2020,"Sun,12/20/2020-7:37pm","I’m sorry to hear that your daughter has been struggling with disordered eating for so long; navigating through eating disorders and anxiety at the same time must feel draining.

33,11/08/2020,OnlineTeenPeerSupport,purplerosehope,"Dear all,D17 was overweight and got herself to lose X pounds from March to September; luckily she never went below normal range in weight, but her restrictive eating got behaviorally out of control and she was hospitalized for first time two months ago due to low HR.  The indicators stabilized and she was released after 5 days in the hospital; the health indicators have remained stable on weekly check-ups ever since.  The last seven weeks at home have been very difficult for everyone but there has been full compliance with meals (even if they take too long), and psychological progress has been very slow but she is starting to make some strides with her therapist and us in terms of accepting the disorder and opening up leads on underlying causes.  Our treatment team is comprehensive (head of adolescent medicine and head psychologist at Children's hospital, both specialists in eating disorders, and highly specialized nutritionist and parent psychologist). They have been very responsive, especially those that are not hospital based; we even have a group chat.In the last two weeks, D17 has opened up quite a bit with therapist and us with underlying causes: years of what she perceives as broad, acute and persistent social rejection in school by peers (she thought caused by being overweight but now she realizes continuing despite weight loss, aggravated by increased academic demands and SAT/ACT testing stress of junior year (as usual, she is an A student across the board) in a pressure cooker top-national prep school and even greater isolation from March through October due to online school and lack of structured school EC activities (which had provided the best outlet for social interaction, and provided real/reliable stability for a few years).  We do not have a diagnosis yet of any co-morbidities, although strong rejection sensitivity, perfectionism, etc and the usual associated consequences around self-perceived failures are definitely present.While responsive, the treatment team does not seem to be aware of virtual alternatives to supplement regular outpatient treatment (two hours of psychotherapy/wk and 3-4 expertly supported meals) virtually with an online teen peer support zoom/videochat group short of a ""full-day"" intensive outpatient program.  Given the perceived underlying causes of the eating disorder, we were hoping to incorporate (ideally expert supervised) virtual/zoom peer group for her that would also ameliorate and help her work on interpersonal dynamics and strategies in parallel with acceptance and hope, which would still allow her to attend school in person during the day. Weekend and nights would probably be ideal.

She is in therapy, she sees a psychiatrist for medication for her depression and anxiety, and she is also getting help From an  Eating disorder clinic. She is working on trying to eat more each day and tryIng  not to purge.
Because of Covid, she is living at home for the last few months after having been living in an apartment and going to college. Her college classes are now all online. Moving back to our house was very difficult for her, and ended up triggering her eating disorder which had been in remission for the last couple of years.
My husband and I are having a really hard time knowing the right thing to do under certain circumstances. It is hard to know whether we are speaking to my daughter or to her eating disorder when she asks us to do certain things. When my daughter asks me for a snack and tells me that she will be fine with it as long as I stay with her for a while after she eats it, and I give her one, and then she ends up throwing it up, I feel terribly guilty and that I made a mistake. But on the other hand, she is 20 years old, and it’s not like I have so much control over what she does. Sometimes, I will give her that snack and she will end up being fine. But how am I supposed to know when she asks me the next time whether she’s going to be fine or whether she’s going to purge afterwards? I know that in some ways this is a rhetorical question, but I’m trying to figure out how to live with the consequences of the times that I Make the mistake and give her the snack and she ends up purging.",Annet,"Sun,11/01/2020-7:44pm","I am glad your daughter trusts you enough to ask you for a snack and accompany her.

At age 16, she seemed to be stable and doing well in recovery, even though she was a little short of the goal weight. Unfortunately, her anorexia has become a pro at fooling herself, us and her therapist. We just found out she's been hiding food and skipping breakfast for months. She's now losing weight again. The biggest roadblock in her recovery is our inability to help her gain weight, even while monitoring X meals, X snacks.

40,03/02/2020,Brutus94,iwanttolive,"Hi.  This is iwanttolive.  I just want to check in to see how things are going?  As for me, I am really doing very well.  I hit a snag a few months back but overall I am  doing the best that I have ever done.  The depression is going away but I always have a low level, dysthymia, I am unsure of the spelling, but it is a low grade depression that doesn't go away.  I struggle with this, but the major depression is gone.   As well as the severe anxiety, but I still take a low dose anti-anxiety med for that.  But I am truly living and happy and engaged with life.  I say this to encourage you that even after one who had been as deathly ill as myself and had been to as many hospitals and programs as I have been to there is Hope.  I know you believe in and have faith in Jesus.  Never give up Hope.  My parent's didn't.  I didn't even though life was so excruciatingly difficult and painful for me.  I am healing and finally found the right therapist to help me work through some of the trauma.  My sister continues to be quite ill.  She is back in the hospital and will be going to a different hospital tomorrow.  Out of state.  She has an extremely complicated condition and most doctors don't know how to help her.  Unless God does a miracle she won't make it.  Even then, our faith and trust is in God and we continue to Hope.  It is difficult to watch as any illness is for any family member.  But with the eating disorder, there is just something about it that makes it really troubling to deal with.  Guilt, anger, shame, sadness.  So many more adjectives.  I deal with guilt and fear and anger with my sister as she hasn't always made the best choices for her health when she could have and now she is so ill.  But as for me and my healing, my parent's get a lot of credit for their unfailing love and never giving up on me.  They tell me they don't know if they always made the correct choices, should they have allowed me to live with them while ""acting out""?  They don't know, they only know they did what they thought was best and what they felt God wanted them to do.  We are very close and more so after I moved out of their home after staying with them  for six months due to some difficulties I was having with my sister.  Since coming back to my house, the issues I was having with my father resolved themselves.  I know it is difficult but keep hoping, keep believing and keep taking care of yourselves as you journey this road.  True recovery is possible.  I am at a good weight and am not afraid to eat and have even stopped the overeating I was engaging in for a while.  It feels good to be doing so well.  And I want to encourage others that it is real and possible.  Take care.iwanttolive",brutus94,"Thu,03/05/2020-4:59pm","Thanks for reaching out.  My daughter has not yet gone to the program she found (the one I mentioned at end of the year), turns out she still needs to ""improve"" in a few areas for them to accept her.  So, she is working with her doctor on that.....but I also think she may be trying to avoid going.  Hard to say.  For sure she does want to go back to school in the fall, so that is a motivator.  Problem is, she has a ways to go and she doesn't understand things take time.  I would have thought after sitting out a year she would have learned that we aren't kidding, and that she really does need to improve before she goes back.  But, the thought process of a young adult with an ED just doesn't seem to process good parental advice the way I would hope.  :)  Sorry to here about your sister.

The behavior makes no sense, and there is no easy fix, and yet the solutions all seem so simple to outsiders.  If nothing else, my experience so far has reinforce my humility and taught me to be more compassionate to the difficulties others are facing.  There is also the struggle of trying to ""accept"" the things I can't change, but at the same time remain hopeful for the best.  Because you are right, true recovery is possible!  But, at the same time, you sort of have to prepare yourself a for the possibility that they won't make it.  My hope right now is that my daughter is motivated to get better so she can get back to school, get back on track, and get her life back.  I fear if she misses another year of school it will all just come crashing down, she won't have the hope and motivation to go on fighting.  And it will also take a toll on our family.Take care!",iwanttolive,"Thu,03/05/2020-5:21pm","Hi  I just want to thank you for responding.  My sister just to clarify is dealing with serious medical conditions.  She does not have an eating disorder.  But as I did, I understand the adjectives I used in showing understanding for those who feel so helpless.  And the fact that my sister isn't thinking clearly because she is malnourished and is so sick.  I want her do more to help herself before the ambulance has to come to the house and it is a crisis, instead of being more proactive, but as you said, we have to allow our loved ones make their own choices  and pray for health and healing.

It is a program she found, researched, and took the lead with insurance coverage, etc.  That is a pretty big step for her, but I think she finally got to the point where she realized life was starting to pass her by and she is tired of it.  A year ago there is no way she would have even considered such a program.  She is already planning to return to school next fall, and she wants to complete this first phase of the program before we go on family vacation in June.  I hope you are doing well.

No matter how bad things might seem, they can get better once the person with ED truly has a change of heart and seeks help.Last year at this time we hit rock bottom and my daughter stayed home from college.  It's been a rough year (ok, 4 years) of frustration, disappointment, anger, denial, fear and hope.  But earlier this year she finally decided to seek residential treatment on her own.  I won't share the details, but suffice to say she took steps and did things that she refused to even talk about in the past.  Why?  She finally found the motivation and overcame the fear.  The physical, emotional, and mood improvements are incredible, and for the first time in years we feel like we are starting to get our kid back.  Oh don't get me wrong, there are still feelings of anxiety and it is still a battle.......but now she is choosing to fight to stay on top!  While relapse is a concern, she has new tools, experiences, and relationships to help better manage.We dropped her off at college this weekend (the college she loves) and the reunion with her friends and classmates was a blessing.  A beautiful memory to help heel, and a valuable reason to continue to stay on top.  Wherever you are in your journey, may the peace and blessing of God be with you and your loved one battling an ED.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

42,06/08/2020,Newhere-seekingadvice,mjherman0712,"Hi All-
I am new here and really struggling.  My 17 y/o daughter has not been medically diagnosed but we are just so distraught over what to do for her.  She has been to therapists who have not really helped.  She won't admit there is a problem to anyone and believes we are crazy for thinking there is!  Her ED seems complex to me.  She sometimes binges, sometimes just doesn't eat, drinks excessive amounts of water and exercises excessively. SO much of her day is spent around obsessing of caloric intake and exercise.   The quarantine has not helped at all.  She has never weighed less than she does now, and she has always been petite. We notice some physiological symptoms in addition to her behaviors.  She is always cold, sometimes gets that blueness in her lips and hands that goes away, some fine hair noted on her skin, periods on and off.  She had a grand mal seizure in January for the first and only time in her life.  All neuro testing and cardiac testing came back normal but part of me wonders if an ED had anything to do with it.  It was a terrifying experience and I am just so afraid of something happeneing to her.  She is athletic which makes things more difficult especially with the exercise component.  I've been looking into treatment programs and found one that has inpatient, PHP and IOP.  I can't find any substantial reviews on it.  She refuses help and sure as her parents, we can force her there but will it work if it is done under full protest? Like if she can't acknowledge there is an issue, will it help?  I'm not even sure what I am necessarily asking but needed to share with someone who might understand.

Sounds a lot like my daughter.....she is now 21 and recently completed several months in a residential treatment program (praise the Lord it worked really well).  Unfortunately, it was a long long road (3 years) getting to the point where my daughter ""signed up"" to go to residential treatment.  She missed a year of college over it, and that finally motivated her to seek treatment.  Now she is in a much better place and poised to return to school (pending Covid shutdowns, of course!).The resistance to getting help that you are describing sounds very familiar.  Has she been to see her MD, and if so what was their assessment?  It wasn't until my daughter lost something she truly valued (she absolutely LOVED the college she attended, and we took all $$$ help away until she addressed the ED) that she made the personal choice to seek help.  And once she decided it was time to get better, she worked hard to get better.One thing I will tell you, one parent to another, is that this is not your fault.  You can make help available, but you can't force someone to get better (at least that is my experience).  Make sure to take care of yourself too!",mjherman0712,"Sat,08/15/2020-6:37pm","Thank you so much for your support.  I am so glad to hear your daughter is doing well.  It's like a yo-yo here.

Like you said she needs to want the help that is being offered. I appreciate your kind words.  This has been quite emotionally taxing on the whole family.  We are all quite emotionally vulnerable right now.  I really hope the doctor can offer some insight.

Have you tried talking to him about it? I don't have kids, but as someone who went through ED as a teenager, I know how hard it can be to open up to parents about these things. Maybe bringing up your concerns gently without commenting on body size or anything (as that can be triggering, it was for me), and just saying you're worried about his behaviors could help.

46,05/27/2020,Parentof2withED,smailmom,"I am reaching out to the community because during this pandemic, I have allowed my 23 y/0 son to move back home temporarily during the pandemic as he is a high functioning autistic young man with a compulsive eating disorder. I am struggling with how to set appropriate boundaries and expectations around food. Three weeks ago, my 19 y/o daughter confirmed that she is purging and restricting. She struggles with anxiety and depression and said that her brother's eating disorder has caused her to feel extremely angry, especially since she feels there is more attention on her ED and not on her brother's. She wants me to ban certain food from entering the home and she has gone to stay with my sister out of state due to this situation.  I have a 21 y/o son who does not currently exhibit any ED behavior. This is admittedly a very difficult time for us as a family, for my children as young adults and as siblings. The issues are many and while we all have our own therapists, there seems to be other issues that have contributed to much of their current struggles. Their father died 8 years ago from complications related to an ED and an Substance Use Disorder. I am in recovery myself and attend AA and work with a sponsor. I have 4 years sobriety. I am a licensed clinical social worker and have worked in addiction treatment. Nothing seems to have prepared me for facing these issues and I am looking for support for myself from other parents. I am interested in finding ways to connect with others to learn how to respond, redirect and remind my children about the dangers of eating disorders and other addictions. Thank you for any support provided.",iwanttolive,"Thu,05/28/2020-7:58pm","Hello there and welcome to the forum. I want to say that I am not a mother, but I have one and she and my father have had to deal with extensive issues with each of their five daughters, ranging from incest, rape, physical violence, dealing with me with a at times a life threatening eating disorder, anxiety and depression.  My sister is now being cared for by them, my father is going to be 80 in July and my Mom 79 in March, and they are making decisions no parent should have to make, the possibility of Hospice.  She is now on Palliative care.  I say all of this to let you know that we didn't survive all of this by ourselves.  We have relied on Jesus for strength and His Hope.  I do not know what your beliefs are but I would not be alive if it weren't for my parents love and the love of Jesus in my life.It is difficult to hear how much eating disorders have played a role in your family.  Is there any way you could have some family sessions?  Would either one of the two be willing?  It may help bring in some understanding and give you some ideas as to how to navigate these waters.  Congratulations on your four years.  That is a good thing and you need to give yourself credit for that accomplishment.  NEDA has a parents tool kit on their web page.  It is very informative and may help you answer some of these questions and dilemmas you are facing.  Also the help line is available if you want to talk or chat with someone.  I just reread your post and you said you are a LCSW.  Unfortunately these issues do not discriminate and even with your training, when it hits home, it doesn't really help as you need support and guidance.  Therapists need therapy.  You know this.  But I am just trying to encourage you to not feel badly that you don't have the answers.  No one is prepared for these issues.  And you may not be the one to help your children understand the dangers of the eating disorders they struggle with.   What helps me is to have my parents listen, not try to tell me I am wrong for feeling a certain way or thinking a certain way.  This comes from years, all my life really, of being corrected and told I am wrong and my father knows more than I do about everything.  So just to be heard, to talk about something that has upset me or that I am worried about without being told to not be anxious about it....those are the kinds of things I need.  I don't know about your children, adult children which complicates things a little bit more...  That being said there are times when if there is a risk of harm or a medical situation you have to act.  I know you know this but I am just rambling a bit here.  So although I am not a mother, as I said, I have one and have seen her suffer with each of her daughters troubles.  I also didn't want your post to go unanswered so I hope you don't mind me sharing a bit with you and to encourage you to make sure you are taking care of yourself as well.  There are no easy answers unfortunately.  Please post again and I hope a mother answers with her input.  Take care for now...iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,05/18/2020,15yodaughter,jzd67,"HI...I am new to this.  Worried about my 15 yo daughter.  Think she is developing ""orthorexia""  She's been limiting herself to 3 (healthy) meals a day. No snacks or sugar, minimal carbs.  Gets irritated if you ask/comment.  Gets irritated if she misses a workout.  Starting to spill over into social time w/friends.  I'm besides myself.  Attempted to talk about it w/her a few times and she shuts down.  Anyone have insight/advice?",iwanttolive,"Tue,05/19/2020-6:25pm","Hello.  Welcome to the forum.  I am so sorry to hear of your daughters struggles and how it affects you as her parent.  I am mostly in recovery but still have days that I struggle.  But far more into recovery than out of it.  I just wanted to start this off with positive encouragement and to let you know that I understand.  The eating disorder I had was serious and if it was not for God and my faith and the love and support of my parents I would not have made it.So about your daughter.  I am not a professional so I can't give medical advice.  I would recommend going onto NEDA's web site where they have what is called a parent's tool kit.  It is quite involved and gives information on the various forms eating disorders take place, it provides help in how to help a child, things that you can say and things that need to be avoided.  NEDA also has an information line or help line where you can chat or call.  From what you are describing your daughter very well may be developing an eating disorder.  But I can not say absolutely.  I think I can say that it might be helpful to bring her to the doctor and have a check up where they can do blood work and make sure everything physically is okay.  I also think having someone to talk with for yourself can be helpful.  It is very difficult to see a son or daughter regardless of age suffer.  Is your daughter in any kind of therapy?  If you talk with NEDA or read through the tool kit, it may provide you with ideas on how to interact with your daughter and boundary setting.  The sooner she gets help the better chances of recovery are.  She may say there is nothing wrong but that may be a defense mechanism because of the fear that getting help means she loses a sense of control.  Eating disorders are very dangerous and can be life threatening.  I do not say this to scare you but to encourage you to do what will help your daughter the most.  Trying to recover without help from professionals can be very difficult.  Maybe you can try just talking with her about every day stuff and try to not pressure her too much about the eating, as it does usually cause a wall to go up and I am not going to listen to you.  Keeping the lines of communication open, letting her know that you are there for her if she wants to talk, but also let her know that you will do what you have to do in order to keep her safe.  I know this is so very painful.  I watched my parent's fears and worries about me and now they tell me what it was like for them to watch me self destruct.  Again because of their love and commitment to me I am able to share with others how much healing has taken place in my life.  I still struggle but much less.  Again, I would recommend having her seen by her practitioner to rule out any physical issues and then maybe ask NEDA their thoughts on a specialist who treats individuals who are dealing with eating disorders.  I wish you the best and please post again and let us know how you all are doing.iwanttolive",BobJ48,"Wed,05/20/2020-1:04pm","Yes, I can see where this is worrisome.  And you may be right as to what you think that it is.People can begin by wanting to ""eat healthy"", but then it can turn into what feels like a ""safety"" concern.  The ""wrong"" kinds of foods are unsafe and must be avoided.  If they don't get their workout in, things can begin to feel unsafe too.  ""Staying safe"" becomes an all-consuming concern, and rigid and inflexible routines must be followed to the letter if the person is going to avoid feelings of crippling anxiety. But hey, they are just ""being healthy"", you know ?  In ways that our society values.  So why in the world are other people challenging them about this!   Other people are ignorant junk-eaters and simply don't get it !! Or at least that's how people can feel about this in the beginning.  As time passes, usually people begin to realize how concerns such as these are getting in the way of their lives, and constraining them in ways that aren't healthy at all.  But by then they can discover that they are trapped, and are unable to to change their ways with suffering extreme anxiety.Folks are going to try and resist this entrapment idea though. Eating healthy is what keeps us safe, not something that causes us problems! You've seen the irritation that shows up when you try and discuss it with her. What to do is hard to say.  Counseling is what's going to be needed I suspect, but as long as she insists that nothing's wrong with her eating and exercise then counseling may be something she'll resist as well.Even so, most people with these conditions have underlying issues that don't really have much to do with food or exercise per sa, but which pushed them in these directions to begin with. Worries about leaving childhood, worries about ""not being good enough"", worries about social acceptance.  If she could see counseling in those terms ( My mom is such a bitch, and always trying to control me !) maybe she'd go to counseling to help deal with those feelings ?Anything to get a foot in the door, you know ?",jzd67,"Wed,05/27/2020-7:38am","iwanttolive...
Thank you for responding.  Your perspective and insight is very helpful.  I'm calling her pediatrician today. I also picked up a book for parents on eating disorders to educate myself.  Silly question, do I read it publicly like I would any other book or keep it to myself?

It is a scary thing to go through.  About reading the book, I would do what you feel comfortable with.  There is unfortunately a stigma that comes sometimes with illnesses that emotional.  But saying that I feel that it is okay to read such things in public and to not have to hide or be ashamed of the illness.  If you think it may  upset your daughter though  I would think it best to read it at home.  But ultimately you are going to have to decide what you are comfortable with.  Also, the parent's tool kit here on the NEDA web site is very helpful and has a lot of information.I am sorry to cut this short but I have to get ready for work.

49,03/18/2020,newchallengeswithcoronavirus/support,brokenhearted,"In light of the coronavirus, I expect that there may be new challenges for those out there with an ED. For example, with gyms closing, my 23 year old daughter is finagling whatever she can to get her exercise addition fix. She did manage to find one that is still in operation. Shame on them. It's hard to believe that gyms are not required to close as the bars and restaurants have been required. I'm guessing the struggle is real for anyone with an addiction at this point; no casino for the gambling addicts, no gyms for the exercise addicts, no bars for the alcoholics, etc. Just thought if anyone wanted to share struggles they are presently experiencing with the onset of this virus, perhaps we could support one another.... Warmly, Brokenhearted",iwanttolive,"Thu,03/19/2020-6:45pm","Hi there.  I am sorry for the pain you are experiencing with your daughter.  It is very difficult. I had an eating disorder for thirty years.  I was sicker than I even remember.  People and my Mom tell me of how fearful they were of my dying.  But thanks to Jesus and my faith, and finally my desire to serve God, I am well and no longer consider myself to have an eating disorder.  My life verse is ""I will not die but live and declare the works of The Lord"".  Psalm 118:17.I know from what my mother experienced watching me suffer, and having another seriously ill daughter, how difficult it is especially for mothers but I have to say equally for fathers.  I hope your daughter gets the help she needs.  It took me way too long to get well and stop hiding in and out in hospitals.  I thought I couldn't live out in the real world, and I had to hide in programs and long term facilities.  But I now know different.  I had a set back in November but for several years I have been doing well.  I still deal with anxiety and some depression but eat anything I want and am happy.  Yes, I am happy.  As far as the virus and being inside, I am quarantined, have been for a week or so, and will be for another two weeks, at a great minimum, I am having to turn to my faith and know that the bracelet that I wear: Jesus Is Enough, that I am now really being put to the test.  I am a soldier in the army of Jesus.  He is my Rock.  This is how I am dealing with this virus and being homebound.  I am not saying it will be easy but I know Jesus will help me.   We all need to help each other in our families and circle of friends in order to get through this.  Those who struggle with an eating disorder may have an especially difficult time as you said, the gyms are closed and work places are shutting down, and social gatherings are being limited.  We need to lean on each other.  As for your daughter, does she talk with you about her fears and concerns?  Are you able to talk with her and share together?  This may help her if she is able to talk.  I don't know where she is at or the level of her illness, but being stuck inside for hours at a time when we are used to being out is difficult.  At this point I am  rambling. If you want to chat again, I will look for your post.iwanttolive",brokenhearted,"Sat,03/21/2020-11:52am","Thank you for the encouraging words iwanttolive.

In my daughter's situation, she has always been a believer, attends services and really hears the messages, reads scripture, devotions, etc.  Unfortunately, ED's/addictions seem to have the ability to takeover a person's judgement ability, overpowering everything they know to be true about God and his word.   Knowing and believing and praying for a healthy existence is part of my entire family's life, but accepting that healing isn't going to happen on our time, is the hard part.  I recently see some improvement in the ED, with less restrictions.  Unfortunately, the control issues are still there and she is seeking this control in other dysfunctional ways. As a teenager, she was the perfect kid- good grades, excellent athlete, never in trouble, didn't party, etc... Went to college and all hell broke loose, managed to graduate with a business degree while playing college sports, but seems stuck in this world of self-esteem seeking. I am living with an unpredictable, deceitful, self-destructive teenager at 23 years old that thinks that she is invincible, although I am grateful that she is not off living on her own through this.  Feeling abandoned by her father after our divorce 3 years ago, has contributed to the situation I'm sure. FYI, this all began in 2018, have attempted some treatment, including PHP, IOP, ... refuses any intervention at any level at this point... In a nutshell, she's stuck and so am I.  Thanks for listening.  Now I'm rambling. I enjoy our discussions... would love to hear more from you.",Savedbygrace ,"Sat,03/21/2020-2:02pm","No matter how strong someone's faith is, they can still be struggling with putting their faith in GOD.  I'm glad to hear there has been some progress made. I'm sorry your family is going through this.   I myself struggled for 29 years, and just this past December,  I FINALLY beat it.  You are in my prayers.",brokenhearted,"Wed,04/01/2020-1:41pm","Thank you for the prayers.  I honestly feel they are helping... I can't imagine 29 years of this!  Thank you and iwanttolive for supporting others going through this.  If anyone understands, you certainly would.",iwanttolive,"Sat,03/21/2020-2:02pm","Hi.  I am glad that you wrote back.  God says in His the Bible that His Word does not return void.  That means that everything  your daughter has learned and understands stays.  It may be hidden.  But it is in there somewhere.  Yes, there are times when healing doesn't come on this side of heaven, but NEVER GIVE UP HOPE.  Hope is a Person.  I understand the hijacking of the brain.  Of the emotions.  Of mother's children.  It happened to me, my Mom and Dad and my mind.  For the most part, I have my mind back.  There are times I have bad body image.  But I no longer have an eating disorder, after thirty  years.  It took me a long time.  But Jesus is and was always with me.  As far as being stuck, you do not have to join your daughter in this mindset.  You are separate from her and her decisions and her mind.  You have the mind of Christ.  Renew your thinking and your focus.  Look toward Jesus.  He is your Hope.   I do not say these things in a vacuum.  I have lived them and so have my parent's.  I am thankful that they never gave up on me.  I thank you for helping your daughter.  Loving her when she isn't easy to love.  You are correct in saying that she isn't herself right now.  I am sorry for your pain and the divorce.  That is never easy.  You say you see some improvements but then you add a but.  I encourage you to erase the but and take hold of the improvement and believe for more.  I know it isn't easy.  It is important though.I hope this helps.Keep posting if you want.  Been there, bought the T shirt and gave it back!!",brokenhearted,"Wed,04/01/2020-1:32pm","Well said... thank you so much for the inspiring feedback. You have been through quite the journey and I really respect your advice/reflections.  Thank you for reminding me how God plays a huge role in all of this.  Since the last time we communicated, my daughter has made some significant improvements, but what I see her struggling with now is self-acceptance regarding the improvements. For example, she is asking for my opinion on what I call improvements and what she refers to as ""disgusting"".  Any advice on how I can help her with self- acceptance/comfort with her improvements?  Thank you...",brokenhearted,"Wed,04/01/2020-11:33pm","Well said... thank you so much for the inspiring feedback. You have been through quite the journey and I really respect your advice/reflections.

I am doing okay. Trying to trust God n all he craziness gong on. He are you coping?  Looking forward to chatting again. iwanttolive",brokenhearted,"Sun,04/19/2020-2:29pm","Hi!
Thank you for checking in with me... I haven't been on this site for a while, sorry.  I hope you are doing well.  My daughter is experiencing the symptoms of restoration based on what I have read, both physical and mental.  Unfortunately she isn't under the guidance of any doctor, so all I can do is trust God and this process of restoration.  I am not enjoying playing Dr. but thankful for improvements...",iwanttolive,"Sun,04/19/2020-2:54pm","Hi.  It is good to hear from you.  Is there any way you can be seen by a medical doctor is you are not able to have a psychiatrist or therapist?  It is important that she has good medical care during this season of her life.  It sounds like she is making progress, Yes?  How are you holding up with all that is going on?  I am glad you reached out again and hope you continue to do so.I am doing okay.  Hopefully I can resume work this week. I am a home health aide so I know there will be work out there, I just have to be careful as to the cases I pick up to keep my sister and parent's safe.My difficult time is at night but last night I was able to use some DBT skills and prayer.  I was able to make it through the night.  I am anxious right now but working on coloring my Mandala's as a way to cope.  It isn't easy but I am taking it one day, one hour at a time.  So again, if it is possible to see a medical doctor for your daughter it might be very helpful just to check to see if everything is physically okay with her.  God be with you.iwanttolive",brokenhearted,"Sun,04/19/2020-3:35pm","Thanks for the quick response... I'm sorry you are feeling anxious right now and am glad you have some coping mechanisms to deal with it.  Unfortunately, the average medical Dr. is poorly prepared for EDs.  The prepared ones are usually employed at treatment facilities!
Also, at this point it is hard to get in to see anyone unless it's a dire emergency.  The symptoms she is having are considered normal and should subside according to what I read.  I feel like getting on a scale at the Dr. office and having a Dr. that does not understand her symptoms could be worse than not seeing a Dr.  I am keeping a watchful eye on her and since we are both home at this point, I am with her throughout most of the day.  Was just wondering if you are working with any medical professionals for yourself? So nice to hear from you...",_admin_moderator,"Tue,04/21/2020-3:13pm",We are sorry to hear of your daughters struggle and wanted to share some resources for you.

I am seeing medical doctors as needed for severe back pain and other medical conditions.  I am waiting to get a spinal cord stimulator implant.   But have to wait as the Covid takes priority. I work with my therapist and psychiatrist on tele med and other doctors that I need but am unable to see because of the virus.  I am given an opening on the computer or my phone.  I hate this as I do not like seeing myself on a screen but I am doing what I need to in order to stay well.  I also am attending church services this way as well.  Staying connected is important.  The anxiety is very high.  I am wearing gloves to prevent myself from chewing on my fingernails.  My mother came over to help me.  Since she has been so distressed with my sister and her health problems, I have felt I don't want to further put on her what will drain her or make her worry.  But I did tell her about the anxiety.  One thing I am careful to do is to not say ""my"" anything, but I struggle with such and so...this way I don't allow it to have any ownership over me.  I belong to Jesus.  He has ownership, not the anxiety or eating disorder.  This helps me.  I am glad you are able to be with your daughter as she needs you right now and if she is letting you this is good for the both of you.  I hope that her symptoms get better soon.  This all takes time.  God bless you.",brokenhearted,"Mon,04/20/2020-11:40am","Bless you too sweet lady...  I'm so glad you have some support... medical professionals and of course The Lord... I like your attitude about Who has ownership over you... you are such an insightful human being.  I can see you helping others as a Christian counselor??!!
When I get angry at the ED and anxiety, I use this prayer:
Jesus- I take my stand in your victory against the enemy and his demons.  I bring truth of God's word against the foe.  You are faithful.  You have conquered satan.  He must flee.  In Jesus' name.  For some reason, it makes me feel better!  I'm sure you have your collection of prayers and bible references!",iwanttolive,"Mon,04/20/2020-8:50pm","I hope you had a nice day.  I had the busiest day in over a month.  And I didn't do much!!!   As far as the perspective regarding the not giving the eating disorder ownership, I believe that came straight from God Himself.  I pass it on to as many people as I can. I think it can be immensely helpful, even for those who do not believe in God.  I have been told that they see me speaking to thousands of people in some form or fashion.  I want to help people but for now I am using this platform.  As I still struggle with the eating  and at times self harm urges, I need to have more ""clean"" time under my belt before I can officially do anything.  The most I would do would be volunteering at a meeting or hotline of some sort.  But that is a bit down the road.I am glad you found a good prayer to pray and to talk with God regarding your situation.  Faith can be so important.  I don't know how I would have made it if it weren't for Jesus in my life.  I struggle with prayer and reading my Bible but I know I belong to My Savior and nothing will change this.  For that I am so grateful.",iwanttolive,"Mon,04/20/2020-8:57pm","So, this is my third time trying to write this out.  Psalm 118:17 says ""I will not die but live and declare the works of The Lord"".  I know this was from God as I lived decades wanting to die on a daily basis.  I could not fathom another week let alone another year, or five or ten.  Death was more appealing.  But then I realized God wants me around for His glory.  For me to share Him with other people.  I no longer have this insatiable hunger for death.  Thank You Jesus.  I want to live.  I want to have less struggles, but I am willing to have them if it means I am able to continue sharing Jesus with others. If it weren't for Him I wouldn't be alive.  So this is a favorite.Take care and keep in touch.",brokenhearted,"Tue,04/21/2020-12:37pm",Love it... thank you...
50,04/11/2020,Hidingsomething,jpnolan1,"Our daughter is 19, and has been fighting anorexia for the past 3 years.  Sometimes when she’s eating a meal we catch her hiding food in a napkin or somewhere else. Typically she denies it, which I understand is how the eating disorder voice will tend to operate.  I’m not sure if it’s best to confront her about it or let it go. When we try to confront it turns in to denial and often a fight. If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.",BobJ48,"Tue,04/14/2020-6:53pm","Oh brother, this hiding food thing is really common.  If she's been involved in her ED for this long, she's already well aware of how deceitful  this is.  Without you having to convince her that it is. Also, in the beginning she may have thought this was clever, but I'm willing to bet that she doesn't see it as clever anymore.  It's more likely that she sees it as shameful. So really, what's the point of arguing, when in some ways she probably feels the same about this as you do ?Which is where I'd try and connect with her if you can.  If she can believe that you ""get it"" about what she's going though, then perhaps things won't be so adversarial, and there won't be so many fights, and she can be more open with you about her feelings ?Because in my experience, most anorexics aren't happy about their situation.  And would feel better if they felt that their loved ones understood that part, in ways that felt supportive to them.  EDs are always a difficult matter, so  just some thoughts.",brutus94,"Sun,04/19/2020-9:33pm","Our 20 year old daughter has been struggling with anorexia for 3+ years now also.  I have argued, debated, and lectured.  Most of the time in a loving/caring way, sometimes not so nice.  Looking back now, BobJ is right, she already knew.We finally took away our financial help for college because we had a deal, and she wasn't able to hold up her end of the deal.  We didn't do it to be mean, and we didn't fight about it, we did it because it was just getting so bad and we had to get her attention somehow.  And she LOVED her college.....and my wife and I loved her college!  And it broke her heart to miss a year....and ours too.  But it was her choice, she could have gone and paid tuition herself.  It was probably the hardest thing I have ever done......sit there and just watch my kid suffer emotionally and physically.  And try to be patient and supportive, the best we could.But, fingers crossed, she is now getting the help she needs.  And the beautiful thing is SHE set it up, she CHOSE it!  It has been a long journey, and it isn't over yet.  But I am absolutely convinced they have to want to get better for themselves, not for us.  And I really hope that is the point she is at right now...….she is more afraid of loosing her future than of giving up the ED.So, my experience says to pray your daughter finds a life calling greater than the ""comfort"" this ED provides, so she has motivation to leave the ED behind.  And find a good stress-reliever for yourself and your spouse/partner......because being supportive and patient is not easy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
