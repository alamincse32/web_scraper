0,05/25/2021,reactionarybingeeating,lookingforhelp,"Hi everyone,
I think my sister has a binge eating disorder but any time I try to bring up getting help to her, it always results in more binge eating. I don't know how to talk to her about getting help because I'm always scared it's going to result in a binge. Does anyone have any experience with this and how did you successfully stop this cycle? Also, I've read in guides that when you talk to them about getting help you should try to limit mention of food or their eating habits, but I'm not sure how to site my concerns about her binges otherwise. Does anyone have any advice? Could you give me examples?Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,03/06/2021,IsuspectmylittlebrotherhasanED,leon2019car,"Yesterday my dad called me and told me he thinks my brother has been throwing up after meals. He noticed that my brother doesn't drink any liquids when he eats and the promptly chugs liquid after dinner. He also noticed obvious throw-up underneath the toilet. My dad told me that he confronted my brother about it, asking him if he's been throwing up after meals. My brother denied it and said the throw up was from one time when he ate too many snacks and felt sick. I am in my 20s and don't live with my family, but when I was home last I noticed my brother skipping a lot of meals because he slept in so long. I really only saw him eat dinner, but he said he ate snacks at night when he was still awake playing video games and we were all asleep. He's always considered himself ""chubby"" and I remember him struggling as a kid regarding it. I am also realizing that he's been obsessed with always chewing gum for the past few months. Maybe that is his way of trying to cover up his breath after purging? My dad had an eating disorder when he was younger for 14 years. He somehow managed to stop his behaviors entirely by himself and seems to think my brother will do the same. I feel so sad and worried and scared. Yesterday after I found out, I reached out to my brother just to play a game online with him and have a casual conversation. I didn't bring anything up about his eating habits because I want to make sure I'm the best support person I can be. Our parents aren't the best proponents of mental health and positive guidance. I also feel so guilty for being far away and not being able to be with him in person. I will be going home in a week though. He hasn't been diagnosed or anything but I don't think I'm overreacting, but maybe somehow the throwing up was just a one time thing? I don't know what to think - I want to take this seriously and be helpful but I also don't want to overreact and be overbearing. Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated",BobJ48,"Mon,03/08/2021-6:22pm","Yeah, who knows what the situation is.  But the idea that your dad would think to mention it to you…He probably wouldn't do that if he wasn't concerned.  I suppose he could be overly sensitive to the matter, having had an ED himself, but then again because he did have his own struggles he may have an eye for things.  For now, it sounds like it could still be hard to draw conclusions. If it were me, I think it's good if you can just be supportive of your brother as a person.  As far as ""symptoms"" go, I'd keep an eye out for various ways that he feels about himself.  People with EDs are often really harshly self-judgmental about themselves, and can question whether they are worthy human beings, so that might be one thing you'd want to look out for. Otherwise, it sounds like it's still too early to tell.  If your dad continues to find ""evidence"" though, that would be a matter for concern.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,02/21/2021,WorriedaboutsisterandherhabitsaretriggeringmeEDthoughts,indigo123,"So basically I am working on a better relationship with food but it's really hard when living at home with my sister. I have noticed she has become more aware of what she is eating, the amount, and avoiding certain types of food. She doesn't really eat that much anymore and has started exercising. This is making it really hard for me to recover and be in a peaceful state with food when I can see that she isn't quite. I also noticed on her laptop that she had been searching for weight loss advice. By no means do I think she should or needs to lose weight, she is on the smaller side anyways, is fit and healthy. She is quite defensive and if we try to ask her anything around the topic she shuts us down and walks off. Having said this, when she sees me making food and it doesn't look like a lot she shows concerns which is helpful for me, but also I don't think she takes that for herself. What shall I do?",_admin_moderator,"Mon,02/22/2021-12:53am","Dear indigo123, welcome to the forums.

I never think it's a good idea to focus on the food and eating part.  As you said, she just gets defensive.  But what you might do is ask her about how she's feeling about herself as a person.  Does she view herself as ""a good enough person"" ?  Or perhaps she is having social issues at school, or difficulties within your family?Like what is it that might be causing herself to worry if she's an acceptable person or not ?   While you may not be able to tell her how she should or should not be eating, the things which may be pushing her towards thinking that if she only lost weight, her self-doubts and such, maybe those are things she might be willing to talk with you about ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,01/08/2021,Isuspectmysisterhasaneatingdisorder.HowinvolvedshouldIget?,Froggie8,"I have an awesome little sister who is going to turn 17 in March. I am concerned that she has developed an eating disorder or is on the path to developing one.
  Recently, my family and I have noticed that she is not on a regular eating ""schedule."" She will skip meals, sleep through them, or just have a snack. None of her food choices are very healthy, even though my mom makes healthy dinner options for her. She instead opts fast food. At first, I just assumed her altered eating was a result of a ""quarantine"" blues type of thing, but her habits aren't changing.
  My eyes weren't truly open to the situation until today. I was with my sister and her boyfriend on a shopping trip. I told her that she was looking really skinny (which I realize now is not the way I should have brought up my concern) and I again expressed my worries about her skipping meals. She admitted to me for the first time that she has a fear of gaining weight. She assured me that she doesn't ""starve"" herself and she eats when she is hungry. I started reminding her how she needs to eat healthier in order for her body to function. She responded that she ""doesn't want to get fat,"" and so I reminded her that if she was concerned about that part, she could always stay active and exercise. She told me that she didn't have time to exercise. At that point in the conversation, I then asked her if she had an eating disorder. She didn't say yes, but she didn't say no. I don't think she is certain either way herself.
  I told her that she needs to talk to our mom about all of this. She said she ""might,"" but told me not to discuss it with my mom.
  My question is: how much or little involved should I be? And what does the involvement look like? Do I let my mom know of the conversation that I had with my sister today, even though my sister told me not to mention it? Or should I stay out of it, knowing that my sister may never independently seek help? Either way, I am going to research how to be supportive in situations like this. Right now, she's in a world of high school self-consciousness, fake social media body ""influencers,"" and a relationship in which her boyfriend is incredibly body-image conscious.
  This is my first experience with someone close to me having a challenge like this (that I know of), so any advice is appreciated. I know how serious this issue is, and I would hate to see my sister hurt. I'm just unsure if it's my place to discuss it with our mother or not.
  Thank you.
P.S.: Now that I look back on our conversation today, I realize that I may have addressed my concerns the wrong way. I will be educating myself on ways to be supportive so that I will be better prepared for future situations.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,01/08/2021-2:56pm","Dear Froggie8, it's great that you would like to support your sister during this difficult time! Please do not hesitate to contact our Helpline to discuss how you can support your sister during this time. Helpline's number is 800-931-2237 or you can chat online here. ",clarabd,"Wed,01/13/2021-9:59pm","I’m sorry your sister is going through this and I’m sure it must be hard for you to watch that. I think your sister is lucky to have you there to support her and it’s great that you’re there for her. And it’s important to inform yourself on how to help her so it’s good that you’re researching it.I think you should tell your mom. It might not be what she wants but it’s what she needs. She can't fight this alone. She needs a support system. A therapist would probably be helpful too. When you talk to her about it, a warm loving supportive approach might be best for her. You’re probably upset or angry but try not to take those emotions out on her. It’s not her fault.I think it’s a good sign though that she’s coming to terms with the fact that she’s sick by saying she might have an ed. It’ll be easier to get her to start treatment since she’s not so much in denial.",BobJ48,"Fri,01/15/2021-4:53pm","One thing to keep in mind : people with Eds often struggle with a lot of self-doubts. Doubts that go beyond food and appearance. One of these doubts is the ""good enough"" thing.  They'll just never be good enough (as a human being) until they get thin.  Or until they can show the sort of rigid self-control and self-discipline that's needed to conquer their hunger and natural urges to eat. Perhaps you see what I mean ?   Their psychological worries and concerns about themselves and their sense of worthiness in the world end up getting played out in all this weird stuff that has to do with thinness and eating.  It can get to a point where it's  like they are at war with themselves, and the normal functioning of their body in an attempt work up their self-esteem. So that's something you might want to ask her about.  If she feels ""good enough"" as a person ?  You might be surprised at what she finds herself saying.But…it's probably not going to help for you to tell her how wonderful you think she is.   A better response might be ""It must be difficult to find yourself struggling with thoughts like that. ""   If you see what I'm getting at ?   Try and put yourself in her shoes if you can, when you are trying to craft a question or a response. Otherwise yeah ; she'll not want to find herself falling deeper into this.  The danger is that these associations with eating and being an adequate human being can get etched into her brain in a manner that begins to be beyond her control.  The longer her thinking goes down this path, the deeper and more persistent these thoughts become.   When you hear people talk about if it's possible to really recover from an eating disorder, this is kind of what they are talking about.  How this stuff can bore itself into a person's mind and never leave, even when every bit of the person wants it to. So while it may seem like a betrayal to tell your mom, if you think she's the sort of person who will react in a sympathetic way, then you might want to tell her.   Because time itself really can be a factor in this.",,,,,,,,,,,,

She has admitted that there is a part of her that wants to hear these comments to reassure her weigh loss, but the other part of her is torn apart. Unfortunately we live in a world where people feel it's acceptable to make these comments, and as an older sister I have jumped to her defense in simply saying that the person making the comment ""Doesn't need to mention it."", but I don't know if this is the best way of handling it.

Were you wanting to know what to say to the people who make those kinds of comments to your sister ?  If so, I'm not sure what to tell you.  Here in the US it's rude to say those sorts of things, but I know that in other cultures it seems to be common, and a normal thing for people to make comments like that.  I suppose you could tell people to mind their own business, but I'm not sure that that would do much to help relive the tension of the situation. And as you said, it's probably not your place to bring up your sister's ED.  So it's a difficult matter for sure.How to help your sister to deal with these kinds of comments is another thing.  As you said, on the one hand her ED may be reassured by such comments, but if she is also trying to recover, they aren't helpful.  One thing that's true is that people who make these kinds of comments are rude and ignorant, but the fact that the two of you both understand that…It's good that you do, but I'm not sure how much comfort your sister is going to feel, knowing that there are rude people in this world. So it's a tough situation for sure.

So many people with EDs struggle to find support within their family, so... I think you’re really awesome no matter what. This is a tough situation because the people saying these things to your sister might be well meaning though let’s be real, their comments are rude. Unfortunately, commentary on weight has been in our culture’s crosshairs for a long time. If she isn’t getting a message about weight personally from someone, it will come through media and other sources. So... it’s impossible to protect her from it. She may need to be the one to shut down the comments with you at her side. That puts the power in her camp, but you can still support her as she navigates dealing with this part of our culture (which we can only hope continues to change for the better).

5,04/23/2020,Momdoesn'tbelieve/careenough?,cactusmoon,"My sister has struggled with an eating disorder for about 5 years. Our family is awful at communication, so we've never actually talked about it but we all know. I could tell from the very beginning and would often get angry with my mom for not making my sister eat or allowing her to skip meals and over exercise. My mom never saw anything wrong in this, even as my sister lost an incredible amount of weight and became a skeleton. I finally convinced her to get my sister some help so she took her to a nutritionist and our GP, but never a mental health professional. She's gained a little weight, enough to satisfy my mom, but she still looks very unhealthy and scary to me. My sister recently mentioned that she missed her period and my mom completely brushed it off and just said ""it happens.""

You are correct in saying that it seems important to get her help now, before she goes off to college.  Do you know why your mother doesn't want her to get psychological counselling?

I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this as a family. When I was going through my eating disorder as a teen, my family had a similar dynamic in terms of brushing it under the rug, which ultimately made things worse of course.  I think appealing to her mom could be a good approach, and perhaps appealing in the most non-accusatory way that you can while trying to inspire action?  The turning point for me getting treatment was actually a neighbor who approached my parents and voiced her concerns and went to them with more of a ""I know this is scary, and this isn't your fault, but we have to do something or your daughter is going to die.""  Every family is different, and every situation is different.  I'm sharing what triggered action in my situation in the hopes that it might be a viable avenue for you.

She has been doing this for years while she was a minor and now that she just turned 18. Her mother refuses to admit that she has anorexia even though doctors and psychologists diagnosed her. Her father is too weak to stand up to his wife. Her mother got her out of the hospital twice within days because she refused to say her daughter has a problem. My cousin is no longer going to doctors appointments now that she is an adult. What can I do? She has never looked thinner. Her heart rate is in the low 30s.

So I guess I would ask how totally she has shut you out.  Do you think she reads any of the things that you send her ?  If she does, then there may be some ways to help, although they may not always serve to convince her to do the things that you wish she would do.What I mean is….it's unlikely that she doesn't know she's in trouble. Not too many people in her position honestly believe that everything's fine.  This doesn't mean they are anxious to quit though. Often they want to keep losing instead. So perhaps you can imagine the sort of dilemma it puts them in.  And then she has to deal with her parents, who sound like they have some issues of their own. So rather than pointing out the ways in which she's endangering herself (which she may already be aware of) instead you might want to say something like  ""I imagine it might be difficult to be dealing with how things are going on the home front.""Her response to which might be ""Thank God  someone finally gets it about that.""Is this sort of approach going to help her quit having an ED ?  Probably not.  But it can help her feel less emotionally alone with her situation.  And that is something that  can make a difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9,08/04/2020,Howcanihelpmylittlesister,caringoldersister122,"My little sister is 15 and in this past year has developed anorexia. She lost a lot of weight and is now really underweight and had to get bloodwork done at the hospital. They discovered physical symptoms during that doctor visit I never even knew of, she had kept secret. I realized that even I had not realized how serious her ED had become. My mom is now searching for a therapist, although the only open appointments were a month away. She’s still looking for more immediate help for my sister but i fear that because she isn’t in an inpatient nor outpatient program she isn’t getting the help she needs so desperately. I cry everyday because i hate myself for not speaking up when i initially noticed her exercising daily and eating less. She is now severely underweight, and she constantly is frowning even while my family is laughing with eachother and i look over and i notice it. It makes me sad that she is so unhappy all the time, i know the ED is taking its toll on her mental health. She also stays home a lot, she’s the only one in my family who doesn’t work, so it’s difficult to cheer her up unless my mom is home to take her out- even then she seems down and has a temper. I want to know anything i can do to help. We had a really heartfelt conversation the day she went to the doctor, and i continue to make lunches for her and dinners that she will eat. Yet she isn’t eating much more than before, still small portions- even if now she’s eating 2 meals rather than 1 barely eaten meal a day. Im just worried we aren’t getting her help quickly enough. I’m constantly stressing that i’m not helping enough because i don’t know how to approach the topic. I ask if she is okay, if she is hungry, i hangout with her and watch tv with her when im home.. I just fear that she is so depressed and crippled by this. She tells my mom she struggles so much with eating & does not wanna gain weight. Since she kept it a secret so long i think its so much more comfortable for her to just keep her thoughts to her self, she tells my mom the most out of any of us but. I wanna be there for her too as best i can. Are we doing anything that is hurting her? Is there anything I should take into account? I would so much appreciate the advice of someone who has recovered from such a brutal disorder.. How can i show my sister recovery is worth it?",BobJ48,"Wed,08/05/2020-7:35pm","Hey there.Not recovered myself, and never had an ED, but I talk online with a lot of people who do, and yeah…How able are loved ones to help with situations like this ?But first, try not to blame yourself, OK ?  EDs tend to sneak up on people, and while we can look back and think about all of the things that we wished we had done, and berate ourselves for not being aware of things which seem obvious now, the fact is that most people aren't very familiar with EDs, and it's kind of the normal thing for it to take a while for them to figure things out. Plus it's clear that you care, or else you would never have posted here in the first place.  So I hope you can set you mind to rest about those things.   Or just a little I mean.And yeah, your sister sounds like she's in the thick of it alright. Being cranky and irritable all the time is a pretty common symptom when people suspect that others are ""against them"" and are going to be wanting them to give up their ED.  I mean don't people understand all of the effort and extreme self-discipline it's taken them to get to this point ?  And they expect her to welcome the idea of throwing that all away, and  just ""getting fat"" again ?   You can understand why she might be feeling pissy.  Other people just don't get it, you know ?So yeah, what can you do ?  Not as much as you might want to, because so much of what happens is going to be up to her.  So you'll need to get used to that part.  Which can be really hard to get used to. You mentioned how much she stays in, and that may be a place where you can help.  It's like people with EDs can start losing touch with the world, as their own world begins to narrow in around them, so anything you can do to try and keep her in touch with the wider world, I do think that's a role we can play.    Go on a hike, go to the museum (if you can)- anything to keep her in touch with the world. That may not seem like much, but sometimes things like that can give the person a break from the never-ending ED chatter that's going on in their heads.Plus people with EDs are often frustrated.  They just aren't losing weight fast enough, people are always bugging them about their habits, God knows what's going to happen when they make her see this therapist person - They have a lot of things to feel frustrated about. So that is something you could say to her.  ""It must be frustrating to have to deal with all this.""  So there you go ; you guys would have something you could agree on, and she'd be able to think that at least you get it about that part.  Which is good, you know ?Anyhow, just some thoughts.  My sense is that there are going to be a bunch of more ""stages"" to go through in all this, so keep writing if it seems to help.B.J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,06/25/2020,Adviceonaddressingadultsister'sdenial?,crosscounter,"Hi everyone. I only made an account because my sister has refused therapy and continues to deny having an issue. Our mother and I both confronted her about it (she tried to turn me against our mother in an argument about whether she is anorexic or not), but she isn't buying it. I'm well aware that denial and an unwillingness to go through treatment is a big part of eating disorders, so I'm not surprised. I just don't know what to do about it.She can't really be forced to go to therapy because 1) it would be cruel of our mother to do the whole ""become independent or cooperate with therapy"" trick during the pandemic, and 2) she is 18 years old. My sister lives with our mother and has never had a job before if that communicates her lack of independence enough. She was diagnosed with autism when she was little, so the idea of using ultimatums like the one I mentioned above is even more difficult than it normally would be.I'm 22 and live on my own (with my fiancé). I actually live on the other side of the U.S., away from the rest of my family (I'm not close with my mother at all, long story). This means I don't have a lot of opportunities to confront my sister about it in person. I haven't tried anything after the first conversation because I have low tolerance for stuff like this, and I don't have the energy to field someone else's serious mental health issues when I am dealing with my own; I have severe OCD and a specific phobia that I am undergoing Exposure Response Prevention therapy for.I know I am improving, and I know that anyone is capable of doing the same if they bother to try. Problem is, she won't. She won't even imagine a world in which she is wrong or in denial. She thinks she's healthy when she is wire-thin and hardly eats. She obsessively reports her unimpressive snacks or small meals to me when she has them to ""prove"" that I'm wrong about her anorexia, or at least that's what it seems like she's doing since she never did this before I talked to her about it.What course of conversation or way of communicating is helpful when trying to get through that denial? I wonder if she finally sees the light, maybe she will do something about it.",BobJ48,"Thu,06/25/2020-6:27pm","It's true, people with EDs can worry about family members becoming aware that they have an eating disorder. And it often turns into the situation you've described.  Denial, and anger towards those who are trying to call them on it. At the same time, she knows that the cat's out of the bag now.  And that you guys do know what the story is.  So as much as she may try and prove that ""everything's fine"", she's aware that you already know that it's not. Alternately, I suppose it's just possible that she believes that she's on a regular diet. But I kind of doubt it.  And like you said, sending you pictures of her meals, that's a little obsessive, you know ?  As an aside, people with EDs often do this - take pictures of their meals I mean. So it was interesting to hear you mention her doing that.  In any case, I hope you guys don't end up stalled in the ""everything's fine"" stage of things for too long.  It's a big waste of time and energy, when you could be talking about more productive things instead. Which is something you may want to try with her.  How's she doing with getting out of the house, for example ?  Or pursuing that sorts of hobbies which may have once interested her ?  Or keeping in touch with her friends ?  People with EDs often find that the breath of their lives is becoming narrower and narrower, and that is something which can become a concern for them. So maybe she'd be more willing to talk about the non-food angles of her life with you ?  Because those sorts of things can effect people's eating disorders as well.Also, might the be things going on to cause her to feel like she's not in control of her life ?  Feelings of not-being-in-control cam lead to eating disorders as well, so that's something you might want to enquire about, if she'd be willing to talk about such things.This all may seem like you are coming at the issue indirectly, but such things may play into this in important ways, and if she can talk with you about those things, it may end up providing the both of you with the sorts of openings-of-communication that you're after. Keep in touch ?",yoyokay,"Fri,07/24/2020-2:11pm","Obviously denial is major in this illness, but for me the scary realization was the undeniable medical evidence that I was quite literally killing my own body by starving it. If I were you, I  would ask her to get a wellness check up, ""just to be safe"", but you would want to make sure that she is honest with the doctor about her limited food intake, even if she thinks ""it's fine/no big deal"". This is because, even if as of right now, her blood work or other lab results are not critical, the doctor will still express concern and be able to warn her about the dangers she is bringing upon herself, and recommend a safer level of food intake. Would there be anyone who could attend this appointment with her, to make sure she does mention the disordered eating to the physician? Perhaps your mother or another sibling if you have one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,06/16/2020,18yearoldsisterpotentiallyhasbulimiaandidkwhattodo,Hopey97,"Context: I haven’t seen my sister in a year due to her moving to Florida to be with her biological father (who hasn’t been in her life for at least 16 years but that’s another story) and she has been living with my mom in California, and they have always had a tumultuous relationship. Neither one has been great to the other, my mom has talked about my sisters weight a lot, especially when she was going through puberty, and my sister has always tried to disobey my moms rules. My sister has also been manipulative with money and has just been mean to everyone, including myself, leaving to be with her friends only 2 hours after I’ve landed, despite listening to her over the phone as well as help her financially despite not having a job myself.At dinner tonight, my sister had a pretty small amount of curry and 15-20 minutes later, went to the bathroom saying her stomach hurt. My mom and I then both heard her turn the sink on and my mom knew right away what she was doing, and yelled at my sister to unlock the door, and when she did I saw the sink was in fact on and we both saw her trying to make herself sick.My mom has essentially given up on my sister, saying that the stress is not worth it for her health (she struggles with ovarian cysts from time to time and they get worse when she’s stressed) and she has encouraged me to do the same, but as the oldest sister at 22, and my sister being 18, don’t want to and I don’t want to be responsible for her death if there’s something I can do.I don’t even know if there IS anything I can do, she pushes everyone away willing to help her (including myself) and I even recommended her a therapist that would take her insurance, but she hasn’t seemed to reach out to her.",Miggi,"Wed,06/17/2020-11:28pm","I'm sorry this is happening, it's a very tense situation, and it will be tough to figure out what to do.

The thing is, people with bulimia often don't want to be helped.  They want to continue doing what they are doing instead. When you
recommended that she see a therapist, she probably understood  you to mean that you wanted her to get therapy to get rid of her eating disorder. Which is something she probably does not want to get rid of.  So no wonder she didn't follow up.However…it sounds like she has plenty of other things she could talk to a therapist about. How she doesn't get along with your mom, and how everyone tries to control her, and other things of that nature.Which are legitimate things to be concerned about, and which may also have some tie-ins with her eating disorder.So yeah, it's not like she has to necessarily get help for her ED, she could get help for other things too.  Which is an idea which might sound more appealing to her ?Anyhow, just some thoughts.  Things like this are difficult, and sometimes you gotta come at them from the side to begin with, rather than starting by confronting them head on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,04/29/2020,HowcanIbesthelpher,Dunn1234,"Hi - I am new the forum and I am very thankful for it! Recently, I have been home living with my sister because of all the recent quarantine orders. I have been very aware of my sisters ED. She Is diagnosed with disordered eating and does not yet fit the criteria for a specific ED. Living with her and seeing her habits form / fluctuate have been so hard for me. I just keep watching her control so much of her food and go so many days eating so little. My fear, of course, is the disease growing and becoming more and more severe. My sister is aware of her struggles and actually acknowledges how difficult it’s been for her.
I guess I am struggling with how to live with her that is supportive but also learning to cope there is not much I can do... she is older, 20, and typically at school living away from home. I also am typically not home with her but given the circumstances. I also am a fixer and it is such my instinct to be proactive and try and assist and fix the problem which we all know doesn’t work unless the person wants to get better. Any advice on how to process, and mostly learn how to not worry so much about our siblings. Also maybe just more information on what’s appropriate to support them but not push them or become fixated on things.  Thank you in advanced. I know there is so much more to this story that is too much to share.  i appreciate everyone here.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,04/30/2020-2:36pm",We understand your concern and want you to know that we have some resources to assist you.

We're in pretty much the same boat. My sister is also 20, and we don't usually live together but quarantine has brought us both back from college to our parents house. I don't know if my parents are really aware that she struggles with this; she's had mental health issues in the past but she's never seen someone for eating disorder related things specifically as far as I know. I think I might only know about it because I pay attention (and sometimes she hints at it on social media). But the last couple weeks I've noticed it's getting worse. She doesn't eat all day until a she eats a smallish dinner (we eat dinner as a family, and I think she's trying to keep us from noticing). She also has taken up running, which scares me cause I know she's exercising on an empty stomach and that can be dangerous.
I don't know what to do! I'm kind of afraid to bring it up with her, I don't really know why. Maybe I'm afraid that she'll just hide from me more and will stop trusting me. I also don't want to tell my parents because I don't think they will deal with it well. I feel so stuck and scared and helpless. I'm also the kind of person who needs to fix things, and she's my younger sister so I will always feel very protective of her. I guess my first step is probably to talk to her about it but I'm afraid and overwhelmed. Ugh",dancergirl,"Thu,06/04/2020-10:00pm","hi guys. i am in the same boat as your sisters-- home from school with eating disorder struggles while trying to make sure no one notices or gets too concerned. i grew up watching my sister suffer from life threatening depression, and there is no worse feeling of hopelessness as you watch someone's mental health crumble. as far as EDs go, the best thing that you can do is just check in. not ""i noticed you aren't eating"" or ""please eat"" or anything drastic, just ask if something is up and if there is anything you can do. this is hard to hear but there is probably nothing you can say to get rid of disordered thoughts and behaviors, but encouraging to get help and even offer to keep the conversation confidential from parents. I am so nervous about concerning my parents, and if they aren't jumping at the idea to talk to a therapist the last thing you should do is bring parents into the conversation right at the jump. encourage professional help, ask what you can do, find out what is helpful by asking and know that you cannot fix them, but you can help them find a way to seek recovery :)",dancergirl,"Thu,06/04/2020-10:03pm","also-- expressing concern is nice but one of the worst ED thoughts i experience is wanting to keep things from everyone because you don't want to make the whole family's life worse with an ED. if my sister came to me and said ""i am worried about you and i am scared"" i would feel terrible for my actions affecting her emotions. definitely doesn't apply to everyone but just something to consider",,,,,,,,,
13,04/16/2020,Canpeopletrulyunderstand?,ditto5768,"I feel I've reached a breaking point in talking to friends about my sister's ED. But I also feel torn about my frustration with this - is it really fair to blame them for not understanding what I'm going through? Does anyone else feel this frustration?My sister is on her 5th hospital admission now and has been struggling for the last 10 years with this illness. Early on I was met with all of the classic unhelpful remarks, which I would try to take lightly. But I feel like those around me are now just tired of this situation and don't want to talk to me about it anymore. I'm constantly met with ""she's back in hospital again?"" and ""Is this still going on?"" (sadly those quotes are not exaggerations). It's not only just a lack of understanding of the illness but I think people find it hard, in general, to talk about illnesses that seemingly have no end or cure in sight. There is no silver lining they can try and comfort you with so instead they'd rather not talk about it at all. But I've got to the point where this frustration is causing me to end relationships and friendships as I find it so difficult to be around people that make these comments and have these misunderstandings. I know I should try and be more forgiving to them but in all honestly, I've run out of energy to do that. Part of me just thinks I should stop talking about this with friends all together and I am really lucky to have a great family support system who are so helpful. But not talking about it at all with people I am close to just seems impossible. This is part of my life, a very big part of my life and I just don't think I can just pretend it's not there and everything is fine. How can I move forwards with this?",carmelfudge_f70,"Thu,04/16/2020-3:35pm","It's hard when friends let you down.

My recommendation would be to not expect too much from your friends.  It's reasonable to want to talk about it with them, and hope that they'll be supportive, but on this particular topic, you've probably seen the extent to which  they want to engage (not much) so letting that be OK is probably going to be your best bet.If somehow they should find themselves involved in something like this in the future, you may see their tune change pretty quickly I think. , But yeah, I don't think you can expect much from people who don't really understand, which is a bummer, but probably just how things go, particularly if the folks you know aren't of the curious sort, or aren't naturally empathetic by nature. Good that you stopped in here though.  And I hope that you will in the future. And bummer that your sis is back in the hospital again.

It is a lot to expect of people to understand such a complex disorder - but also to understand the complex ways families and friends of people with ED suffer too... I do feel my own mood and thoughts about it all change a lot too, sometimes I'm really angry, other times I feel very low and other times I can't really express how I feel. I can see that that can be a lot for someone with no experience of mental health to deal with.
I think you're right about trying to find peace with it too, and I think it is important to see the difference in intention when people are not wanting to engage vs trying to engage but not really understanding.
Thank you for your support! I appreciate it very much",iwanttolive,"Thu,04/16/2020-7:01pm","Hi there. First, welcome. I am sorry that you have been dealing with friends who just don't understand and your sister dealing with an eating disorder. I am sure it isn't easy on you either. I know my sister's had trouble dealing with me and my struggles. It does seem that mental health issues are frowned upon more than medical but that is because they are so misunderstood. And often it takes a long time to heal from. They are so multifaceted. I encourage you to take care of yourself while you support your sister. Do you two talk?
I am sorry they seem to be putting you in a position of choosing them over her. It is painful to watch someone we love suffer when it seems ""enough"" time has passed. It has taken me a long time to get to where I am today. I wish I was completely in recovery. My roommate doesn't understand. She says things like, you have had enough therapy, you know what to do. I know she doesn't understand but it is still frustrating. NEDA has information on their web site that may be helpful for your friend's if they are willing to read.
I am glad you reached out. It must be scary for you to see how sick and how long your sister has been struggling and how her illness has perhaps overshadowed some of your needs. Please post again. iwanttolive",ditto5768,"Fri,04/17/2020-6:21am","Thank you for your comment! Yes, me and my sister are very close and we talk all the time which I am really grateful for.... but I do think that can make it hard for people to understand too... obviously this illness can make her a difficult person to deal with sometimes and if I talk to my friends about that side of it they will say things like ""she's a nightmare"" and ""why do you do all this for her, she's not a good person"". That really hurts because even though the things she has done and put my family thought have been pretty bad but she is still my sister and I still love her very much. I think that complex relationship is really difficult for people who don't have experience of mental health to understand and can lead to those hurtful remarks.
I will always put my family over any other relationship and I think sometimes when I feel like I can't be friends with people anymore it's as much to protect my sister as it is to protect myself in a strange way... I just don't want people who say things like that to be anywhere near her.",,,

""  While you didn't say, I bet she isn't happy about it either."" She is unwilling to actively seek help. In the back of her mind she want's to heal…""Yep, both of those things can be true at the same time.  It's pretty common for people to have that sort of ambivalence.  Plus If she's had these same issues off and on in the past, she may feel like she's doomed to continue like this and etc.  Negative thoughts about their chances of really getting free of it. One thing that can happen though, is that people can start to catastrophise about their situation.  They have a past history, are OK for a while, but then they purge once or twice and think that means that they're doomed for this big relapse.  When really, they just purged a couple of times, which doesn't necessarily have to signal the end of the world. If things continue to seem bad for her, one idea you can introduce is the idea of taking a risk.  Sure, she could decide to see a therapist, and after working up the courage to do that,  the two of them might not click at all.   Or she could see some marvelous therapist, and even then she might not get well.  Or it's just possible that she could meet one that's actually helpful.  The truth is that there's just no way to know ahead of time, which gets back to the idea of risk-taking, and how she does or doesn't feel about that. Anyhow, if she worries that this relapse is going to be a persistent thing, the idea that she may need to take some emotional risks is one thing that you could bring up, if it seems like she'll need outside help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,04/07/2020,I'mnotsurehowtohelpmysister,Mothman,"My sister told me nearly a year ago at like 3 am that she had been choosing not to eat for periods of time.That night I talked to her about going to see a therapist, and she told me that she wouldn't be opposed to it, she just did nOT want my mom to know why see was seeing a therapist.I told her that I would tell my mom she wanted to see someone for her social anxiety, and she agreed.I told our mom, very carefully, a few days later because I felt it was something necessary for her to know since I had been planning to move out shortly after. I told her that as far as my sister knows, she cant know, but I wanted to be sure someone in the house was aware.Long story short I didnt end up moving out, so now I still live with her. We share a room, and we recently moved to a new state. Shes not seeing a therapist anymore because of that, and she said she refuses to see another one because her last one wasn't a good fit for her.So that was the extent of it as far as I knew until a few days ago. I thought therapy and other stuff had been helping, at least a little, but I was..not correct in my assumptions.A few days ago we were talking at around 4 am, both of us drunk on sleep deprivation and being silly and dumb and laughing. When we were talking, I touched her leg because she had been pointing out something on it and then she panicked and broke down crying. I just kind of sat there because she hates people to talk to her or go near her when she panics or cries, and after a few minutes she calmed out and wiped her face and was like ""I'm fine""A few days later we went shopping and she opened up to me about it, and told me things that I hadn't been aware of before. She told me that at a time she had been restricting, and that she'd fainted several times when no one was home during that period.  She started eating more after she had fainted a few times, but even up until now shes still counting calories and wants to work down to a lower number.There's other things she talked about, like skipping dinner every other night, or how eating gives her panic attacks and I just like....I don't know that there's any way I can help her without losing her trust...and I think that's more dangerous...because at least right now she'll talk to me...We went around and bought some healthier foods that she'll eat (she's had sensory issues her whole life and cant handle eating certain foods due to texture) because I want her to be eating /something/ without her feeling horrible all the time. I asked her if we could make a deal that she'd eat more (and I could help her put together meals and stuff) if I would be willing to do workouts (mostly stuff like yoga) with her because I know shes concerned about losing weight but I feel like doing a daily, light workout would be...I dunno....safer?I'm lost on what to do.

We recommend that your sister seeks medical attention as soon as possible. ",Mothman,"Sat,04/11/2020-2:58am","As far as I am aware and according to what she has said, she had fainted a few times but that was around a year ago. As far as I know currently, that's not been a problem for a while as I've been with her most of the time for the past several months.I would like for her to get some medical help but at the current moment, we cannot easily access a doctor since we do not have insurance in the state we've moved to, nor do we have a primary care physician or therapists/psychiatrists to go to. That, in the wake of covid19, makes it difficult to get very far in that regard, but I have been talking to her about it somewhat.We've compiled a list of foods that she likes and that don't stress her out, and were going shopping for food for the next few weeks tomorrow, so I'm hoping to be able to get some things for her. She ate a few snacks we had laying around today so I know shes still eating something.As for what Bob said, I think you're right in some regards but in other regards its...less simple. My sister has trouble feeling empathetic toward other people most of the time. We've been told by doctors and therapists she may be on the autism spectrum or have something in a related circle but she hasn't been diagnosed. My other sibling is autistic, as is my grandmother so it's certainly not out of the realm of possibility.That being said though, her lack of empathy for other people at times makes me think that she would likely not...be entirely affected no matter what I did. I cant pull at the empathy of someone who can ignore it, yknow? To a point I've been able to get to that side of her, and I think it...bothers her that I'm concerned for her? But if I make it a bigger deal I've seen her switch it off before and in sure she could do it again.I'm walking the thin line currently of expressing my concern when were talking about it, but also of keeping up the joking relationship we've always had to avoid it getting too serious and her clamming up.

People aren't want to going to talk about it if they see us getting upset or freaking out.   At the same time, you continue to show that you believe it's a matter of important concern.  As you said, it's a delicate mix sometimes, but the fact that you can retain the part where you both know that you are friends is incredibly important I think.  That's the part that makes things feel safe, I think.As far as helping, just that she has someone to talk to…that counts as important helping right there, and maybe what our best role really is.  So I hope you can feel like you are ""doing something"" already. Because if she can talk to you, then you are, I believe.

Hopefully my next post will be on the lighter side of this."
16,03/03/2020,SisterDenial(reflux),worriedbrother99999,"hi my sister has had an eating disorder for nearly 2 years and at the beginning was eating normally but obviously purging afterwards. she is now at the stage where she claims she no longer has an eating disorder but that she has an eating reflux, where anything she eats automatically comes back up. she denies this is an eating disorder problem and is adament its a physical condition. my parents and me are out of answers and she is not starting to refuse to go and see her therapists as she claims she is over her eating disorder and just wants her stomach relux to be fixed and she will be all better. i dont know whether to face up to her and say this still is her eating disorder or go along with her and hope she continues to talk to her therapists and she will get better? any help at all would be so appreciated. thanks",BobJ48,"Tue,03/03/2020-1:34pm","I'm not an expert on this, but people can have medical problems (specifically gastroparesis) where they eat, but their stomach won't empty itself along into the rest of their digestive system, so the food just sits there and they end up throwing everything back up again.  Having been previously bulimic can set a person up for this serious medical condition, so I think it's worth taking her complaints seriously, and getting a medical opinion one way or another. There are treatments for it that can sometimes work, as well as well-established tests for the condition, but it's something that can turn into a particularly distressing lifelong condition ( a close friend can no longer eat solid food, and has to be fed through a tube in her side) so I'd want to get her to a doctor and have her checked out soon if it were me.  Otherwise, I suppose she could just be trying to fool you all, but really, if she seems to say that it's out of her control, it's quite possible that she's telling the truth and should get checked out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
