During a conversation I started asking him about his eating habits, as at this time I am very sensitive on the subject and alert to eating behaviors.  He mentioned that he fasts multiple times a week for autophagy (cellular regeneration). He claims it reduces inflammation in the body and is good for brain health.

1,03/14/2021,Didbulimiaplayabigroleinmybreakup?,MAFSA,"I started dating a woman three months ago. I'm in my mid-30s, she's in her mid-20s. It went exceptionally well - I'm not sure I've ever clicked with anyone quite as well in my whole life. Smart, funny, just full of energy and enthusiasm. Things went super fast, we spent a huge percentage of our time together. I was smitten on day one and more smitten every day since.I figured out pretty fast she was bulimic, basically by overhearing the purges. She admitted as much a little after, although she never really talked about it at length. She'd drop a depressed ""I can't keep anything down today"" in a text, or occasionally a ""I haven't thrown up in a week!"" but it didn't seem like questions were particularly welcome, and they generally went unanswered anyway. I tried to be supportive in a broad way, while not making comments about food or her appearance other than to say she was beautiful (not hard, it's true). She said the bulimia was recent development, about five months old now, and that I was the only person who knew. (I think she only used the word ""bulimia"" once, come to think of it.) The impression, to me, was that this was a bad thing, but maybe not the end of the world? In retrospect that was a pretty silly thing to think, with her throwing up multiple times a day! One strange thing about our speedy romance was that the rush forward was punctuated by occasional comments from her about too much commitment. She'd say she was falling in love with me, that I was the nicest man she ever met, but then she'd say she wanted to slow down, or that she was afraid she'd turn toxic and hurt me, or she was worried we weren't compatible. We were never, technically, exclusively dating, although she told me that she'd ""withdraw so fast"" if I went out with anyone else. I'm generally easygoing about these things, and she was very recently single before we started dating, so I chalked it up to her wanting to just ease into things or having some lingering insecurities, which seems normal enough.At one point about a month in she actually dumped me out of the blue. I said something that rather inexplicably frustrated her (I mentioned her recent breakup to a friend, which she told me was very private). The next day I received a bizarre text, almost written like a job rejection letter, saying it was nice to know me but she didn't think it was going to work out. I was shocked. She came over and we had a long talk. The main thing I remember from that was her flat, almost irritated affect, while I was very emotional and teary and confused. I couldn't understand where the energetic, expressive person I cared about had gone. Eventually she said she wanted to go slower (this seems to be have been the real issue all along) and things pretty much went back to normal. In fact, nothing seemed to slow down at all - she seemed more excited about the relationship than ever.Fast-forward to two weeks ago. Suddenly she begins not really responding to my texts or calls. I've dated enough people to know SOMETHING is up, although I can't really say what. I'm starting to get paranoid. We aren't seeing each other quite as much, and she's not staying over very often. Being an idiot, I start to worry she met someone else she likes more - remember, we're technically not exclusive. A week ago she says she wants to slow down, and makes a few comments that vaguely suggest she is dating other people. I get very upset - not mad, but emotional, very sad, very confused. For the record, I feel terribly guilty for expressing such intense emotions, I think in retrospect it was the exact wrong approach. But I didn't understand why she'd withdrawn so quickly and I became worried maybe the feelings she'd expressed weren't real, and I'd been played for a fool somehow. Over several days of emotional conversations - well, emotional on my part, she never indicated much emotion at all at this point - I make the huge stupid mistake of asking her outright if she's been using me. She's very upset by this and wants to end things. So she does. She picks up her stuff and we have a long conversation, which pretty much goes the way of the rest - me very upset and confused, trying to explain how much I care about her and how baffled I am, and her, again very flat, talking about how she's disappointed in me (""not mad,"" she says) and wishes me the best. She tells me she doesn't owe anyone honesty - not me, not her friends, no one. She says we're not compatible and I'm just a lonely person who needs company, who needs to deal with my insecurities. I know I'm not perfect, but I swear, it felt so much like she was LOOKING for things to blame me for, and had no interest in working past them once she found them. It felt like she was looking for any door out she could find. The phrase I kept using with friends afterwards was ""like someone flipped a switch"" - the loving, wonderful woman I knew just deleted. She argues with me about gifts I've given her. I want her to take them, she doesn't want to ""owe"" me anything. Then she leaves.Naturally I was devastated, confused, and despairing - I feel like I've inexplicably screwed up the best relationship of my life. It at no point occurred to me at all that any of this might have anything to do with her eating disorder. Then I had a conversation with a friend who had struggled with similar issues, and she said: ""I was pretty sure this was going to happen eventually."" I googled it, found this forum, and found post after post describing bizarrely similar breakups and conflicts. Okay, apologies for the long, long story. Here are my questions:
-Am I crazy for suddenly thinking that a lot of the inexplicable stuff in our relationship, and maybe even the breakup almost in its totality, was the result of her bulimia? I know there's a danger here because I am very sad, and searching for any explanation, and this is one that lets me off the hook while even getting to believe that she really meant all the nice things she said. And during the relationship I never ascribed that much importance to the eating disorder, which felt like a separate, private thing of hers (albeit one I privately hoped very much she could address). But the pattern is so similar to the other stories here!-Reading this forum has also made me very worried about the safety of my ex. She's moving into a new place by herself in a few days (something that was already causing her a lot of stress) and she's estranged from her family (for good reasons). I don't think she talks about any of this with her friends. She has some preexisting mental health issues on top of the eating disorder, and I worry that this move will just make it easier to avoid seeking any help. Is there anything at all I can do? Even if things between us are done, I want her to be safe, happy, and healthy, and most of all, to see some kind of professional. I worry she is isolating herself. -Do people who have experienced similar things have any guess about what happens next? Is she going to ghost completely (I asked her this and she said ""I don't know, I can't predict the future"")? Or is the desire to pull back something that comes and goes and waves? I know there's nothing I can do about it either way, but I guess I'm curious, as a person whose mental energies are currently heavily occupied by this.",BobJ48,"Mon,03/15/2021-3:07pm","""I googled it, found this forum, and found post after post describing bizarrely similar breakups and conflicts.""Yes, how about that ?  I've worked here for about 7 years, and on another site for 10 years before that, and you really do hear this same story over and over.  The authentically wonderful person, who in a moment of intimacy shares their secret, and rather than the relationship benefiting from the shared closeness, things inexplicably fall apart instead.  And really, what sort of fellows show up on a forum like this ?  Not jerks - it's the good men like yourself.   In fact, it's almost like being a good fellow puts a guy at higher risk for something like this.  Which also often seems to be the case with people who get EDs themselves.  It's often as though being a good person is also a risk factor for having an ED.   So…a lot of things going on underneath the surface I think. "" Am I crazy for suddenly thinking that a lot of the inexplicable stuff in our relationship, and maybe even the breakup almost in its totality, was the result of her bulimia? ""No, I don't think you are crazy for thinking so.  As you said, you hear about this same mysterious pattern over and over.  Everything seems fine and even wonderful, and then once the cat's out of the bag, suddenly it's not. ""-Reading this forum has also made me very worried about the safety of my ex. She's moving into a new place by herself in a few days…""Yes, situations like that can be legitimately worrisome.  Just the person and their ED, alone together.  Some people can hold things together better than other people can, but if she's at a point where sometimes she goes on a binge and purge run that can go on for hours, that's not an encouraging place for a person to find themselves in.
What can you do to help ?  My sense is that it will hinge on what she will allow you to do. Which may be nothing, if she has truly cut you off.  Which can be an awfully helpless feeling, when we feel nothing but authentic good-will towards the person."" -Do people who have experienced similar things have any guess about what happens next? Is she going to ghost completely (I asked her this and she said ""I don't know, I can't predict the future"")? Or is the desire to pull back something that comes and goes and waves? ""You'll just have to be patient I think.  I think you can be certain that she knows that you care about her, so I'm not sure that you need to emphasize that.  Plus she also understands that she's treated you in ways that you don't deserve.  It's pretty likely that she understands that he ED is not a positive thing in her life.  So despite her distancing herself from you, I think you can be sure that she understands all these things.  How she decides to put this all together…well, it's a difficult thing to try and put together, so it may indeed end up being a back and forth sort of thing.  Or not, depending on how frustrated she gets with herself.  So for now, as much as you may hate it, you may need to back off and simply see what sort of openings she presents you with.  If you are OK with that I mean. As a caring person, you don't want to find yourself a slave to her changing emotions.  Because from a ""looking out for our own health too"" standpoint, that should not be your reward for caring, you know ? In any case, if you find yourself being confused, it's because situations like these are truly confusing.  Please try not to blame yourself, or spend too much time worrying about ""if I'd only done this instead of that"".  I think you've done pretty well already.But yeah, eating disorders.  People may think they know something about them, until they find themselves dealing with them in person. They are complicated things, and the ways that both sufferers and loved ones go about navigating the waters is often unpredictable and uncertain.Keep writing ?",MAFSA,"Tue,03/16/2021-12:16pm","Thanks for the reply, Bob - somehow I figured you'd be on top of this. I showed this to my friend who first suggested this was a problem and she and I both agree you're incredibly good at this. I hope you know it's appreciated.It sounds selfish, given the gravity of what she's going through, but some of the toughest stuff here, for me, is knowing what was real and what wasn't. She was so cold and different when she dumped me. I was desperately looking for any sign that, even if her mind was made up, the relationship ending was affecting her too. But there just wasn't any. She erased me with the same kind of vague frustration you might exhibit if you tried to cancel an internet subscription and it was taking too long. I asked about a few things we did - things at the time that seemed to bring her obvious joy - and she said ""That was nice of you!"" or ""That was a nice day, yes."" But she said she'd been caught up in the moment (for months??) and after thinking on it a few days, wasn't interested anymore. She denied remembering some of the things she said to me, most notably that she was falling in love, although she shrugged and said that she might have said them, and was sorry for that. I've been assured that this was the ED talking, almost like a separate entity living inside her, but it's hard to shake the feeling that I fell for a mirage or performance -- or alternatively, that people's feelings are so ephemeral and impermanent that it's effectively the same thing, and so many close and wonderful moments together can just evaporate in a few hours. I know it isn't healthy but I sit around and wonder if she's given me two moments' thought or even remembers much about the relationship, a week later. Which is almost more unsettling than believing I'd been had.",BobJ48,"Tue,03/16/2021-5:41pm","Thanks for the compliment.  Many years ago I had a friend who passed away from her eating disorder (as well as a lot of other issues) so that's how I ended up involved in all this. You wrote :""…. or alternatively, that people's feelings are so ephemeral and impermanent that it's effectively the same thing, and so many close and wonderful moments together can just evaporate in a few hours.""Yes, that part is strange, and I think you are right in assuming it's not the normal way with people. With most people that is. The apparent coldness and the air of detachment I mean.  That's not always the way with eating disorders either.  People can push us away, but even so, usually there are some feelings and emotion that's involved.""I've been assured that this was the ED talking, almost like a separate entity living inside her, but it's hard to shake the feeling that I fell for a mirage or performance.""It's interesting to hear you say that, because some people really do have an unstable ""sense of self"".  They can take up a persona and play it out well, but there's really no consistency to their internal construct.  And you do hear people talk about this.  About how they don't have a reliably stable sense of who they are.  Which can be an unsettling thing for them. So in that sense, the person you knew may have disappeared.  And now she's trying to assemble a new person for herself.  One that doesn't contain the challenges of a complex and caring relationship.Again, this is all complete speculation, but ""sense of self"" issues can be a very real thing for some people.  Borderline Personality Disorder is a diagnosis that has a huge stigma around it, so it's not a term to throw around lightly, but folks who have that can have some real sense-of-self problems.  You mentioned that things took off super-fast between the two of you, which is also something that can happen with folks like that. They can also be prone to black-and-white thinking ; One day you are the greatest guy in the world, and the next day they can't imagine what they ever saw in you. So interpersonal relationships can turn out to be a difficult matter with them.  These folks can often have EDs too. Again, it's probably not fair to speculate, but it's been my experience that if our instincts are telling us that something strange is going on…then it probably is. Anyhow, just some other things to consider in trying to make sense of this.",MAFSA,"Wed,09/29/2021-2:29am","Resurrecting an older post here, but there are some new developments. I spent a lot of time researching BPD and realized that it was a perfect match with my ex - not just the ED, but the fluid identity, self-harm, fear of abandonment, very strong and changing emotions, were all obviously present, although she did an excellent job of keeping this stuff hidden or downplaying it when I was around. I did quite a lot of reading about BPD. One thing I learned is that after leaving BPD sufferers often come back to old relationships.And that's exactly what happened. Six months after we broke up, almost to the day, she called me and asked to get dinner. On one level, I was shocked - I was still blocked on a lot of social medi and there wasn't any sign of a thaw. On another, I had read so much that I almost expected it. Anyway, long story short, she and I have reconnected some. We still get along extremely well, so well that it's been almost too easy to forget about the six-month absence. She's been more open about her mental health issues, and has received some additional therapy and treatment, although she hasn't mentioned BPD (and I'm not going to mention it before she does). For my part, the reading I've done has helped a lot - there are a lot of strategies for dealing with BPD-style emotional volatility and they've been very successful. Okay, here's the problem: despite all this, the bulimia still seems quite bad. She's told more people about it, including her doctors, therapist, and a number of friends. She has some medication for it. And she seems more comfortable mentioning it to me. But ultimately she still throws up fairly frequently after meals, especially when she's feeling anxious or bad about her life otherwise. In fact, if anything, she seems a little more fatalistic about the situation. Is there anything I can do at this point? I care about this person, and she clearly wants to be part of my life again, at least for now. I know that BPD means she's going to necessarily be more volatile and unpredictable than most people, and any relationship with her is at a higher risk of collapse, but I've arrived at some acceptance of that reality. But the bulimia is different - it's really hard to accept someone who is a significant presence in your life harming herself like this so frequently.",BobJ48,"Thu,09/30/2021-4:31pm","Good to hear from you, and interesting to hear that you read up on BPD.  Not that many people are familiar with the condition, so it's something that you checked it out. And yes, it can ring a lot of bells, and explain a lot of things.Good to hear that your friend seems more comfortable mentioning her issues. As you said, you may not want to bring up BPD unless she does, but it's possible that she has some awareness of it herself.  It used to be felt that people with BPD were unable to have any personal insight into their condition, but I can assure you that that's not the case at all. The stigma around the diagnosis seems to be a little less too, now that the profession has some therapeutic tools to work with.  DBT being the main approach now. But yes, the Bullimia.  Like you've noticed, it can ramp up during times when the person feels there are things happening which they have no control over, or during times of stress just in general.  Plus (yet again) the whole ""good enough"" thing.""I can imagine you must be feeling anxious"" or ""Things really are difficult I know"" where she can trust that you know how she's feeling are probably the best responses.  They don't actually ""fix"" the situation it's true, but people can feel less stressed and less alone if they know that others have an idea of how they are feeling. Also, keep in mind that most people with bulimia are not happy about their condition. Sure, they seek the behavior in order to feel better in the moment, but in the long run they usually hate the idea that they are a slave to the thing. This is probably not a very helpful note I know, but I'm glad that you wrote, and I do hope you'll feel OK about sharing your feelings as matters progress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,08/28/2021,Whentopushthepanicbutton?,blusp,"Hi Everyone,
I've known my wife for about 20 years and been married for 10. Until February this year she never appeared to have an ED but has since seemingly developed anorexia. I think the trigger was her putting on some weight such that she didn't fit in some old clothes, although she was still within the healthy BMI range. Since then she has plummeted in weight. As far as I can tell she is barely eating and is exercising at least 2 hours a day; likely more due to all her pacing around the house. The positives currently is that she diagnosed herself with a problem and sought help from a professional specialising in eating disorders, which she is seeing in two weeks. She came to me and told me what she was struggling with in about late July.So she seemed on top of things and I tried to support and not interfere but since then her weight keeps dropping. She keeps a log of her weight (which I have read behind her back, I apologise) but it means I know that she is lying to me when I ask how things are going and she says she is recovering and gaining weight whereas I just see the real numbers going down. She is incredibly secretive and doesn't want anyone to know about this which has put me in a difficult position as my parents want to visit but I've had to make excuses since she doesn't want anyone to see how thin she has got. It's difficult hiding all this from my son (9 years old) who I think knows something is up. I hate lying to him so I have to walk a fine line between feeling like I explained things the best I can to him and not causing my wife to become extremely upset. Lately I have become concerned about my wife driving my son places, since I know at her BMI she should could potentially faint - I haven't brought this up with her yet, but I suspect it will cause more upset. In fact, if others can chip on this point explicitly it would help a lot.Each time I raise something of concern she says ""I stress her out which doesn't help her recovery"". Of course I want to help, but I am also growing concerned that there is no recovery and she just wants no one interfering with her ED.I desperately want to respect her wishes and the way she wants to do things. But I'm beginning to feel there must be a point where you hit the panic button where you tell a wider circle of family so they can support and start overriding her; like getting rid of all the exercise machines she has bought. What do I do?Please help.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,08/30/2021-10:57am","Hi blusp, welcome to the forums. We’re glad you’re here and are sorry to hear about what’s going on with your wife.

""Each time I raise something of concern she says ""I stress her out which doesn't help her recovery"".Yes, and she's probably telling the truth when she says that.  Try and keep in mind the idea that at their heart, EDs are about a person being in control, which really is what they can seem to be about for the person in the beginning.  All that self-discipline, strict regimentation  and hard work, you know ?  Just the sort of thing that helps us feel in control.  But with time, it begins to dawn on the person that it's just the opposite - that the ED is controlling them instead.  This clash of ideas can be super-unsettling for the person, and when we try and ""be helpful"" it can just stir up those conflicting ideas, and the stress that comes with it even more.   So the person gets stressed, and feels less in control, and since their EDs has become so strongly associated with control for them….maybe you can see what I'm getting at. Their ED can get worse rather than better.  It's an unsettling mental cycle that's almost beyond their control, and like the ""snake eating it's own tail"" thing sometimes. My sense is that what's going to feel supportive to her is if you can seem like you get it about this. Saying things like ""I know it must be difficult to feel like you are not in control""…that's absolutely going to feel like the truth to her.  ""I know it must be hard to feel like eating is the right thing to do"" - there's going to be no disagreement about that either. If she feels like you understand what she's going through, that's what's going to be the most helpful I think.  "" But I'm beginning to feel there must be a point where you hit the panic button where you tell a wider circle of family so they can support and start overriding her; like getting rid of all the exercise machines she has bought.""Again, keep in mind the control thing.  If other people start trying to control her, things are likely to get worse and not better.  Conversely, she'll feel more in control (in a healthy way) if she makes these decisions herself. None of this is going to happen overnight though, so having patience is part of your task as well.But again, the idea that she's willing to get some outside help for herself is a really big deal (  ""I know it must be kind of scary to think about getting help for all this "" )  so I'd wait and see how she responds to therapy before I started involving the rest of the family, which to her is just going to feel like more people who want to control her; an idea of which is unlikely to lead things in a good direction. Anyhow, it's not good to be alone with this sort of thing, so keep posting, OK ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,08/12/2021,Husbandisnoteatingandconstantlyweighinghimselfbutindenial-,Rose63,"Hi all:I'm new here - my husband has quite a bit of weight in a short period of time.  not that he was even that much overweight. but he just kept going and is now obsessed with not eating and weighing himself. He continues to say he's full after eating half a meal.  even says he feels nauseous.  Yesterday he only ate a little bit.  that's it. All day long.   said he wasn't hungry.I have told him I'm worried about his weight and asked him to talk to me about whats going on.  I've said I'm here to talk about anything.  I support him and I love him.  I've told him nothing is too much for me to hear...  But he's in denial.   he doesn't do that cover up thing - he acutally continues to buy smaller clothes and wear small shorts which show his stick legs.  I do not tell him to eat or force him to eat or anything.  We serve ourselves at dinner.  I do try to make things he really really likes though.  I believe he's in total denial - his kids have even mentioned their concerns.  None of us nag but once ina while we might mention it.  People at work have asked if he's OKSo my question for you all is - is there anything I can say to help him see the slippery slope he's on?  that weighing himself 20 times a day shows that he needs help.  I'm even thinking of calling his doctor to have her talk to him.  but that seems invasive.  I just want to help him seek help.  Note, I do know the three Cs - i didn't cause this, I can't control it and I can't cure it.  but perhaps I can help him get help before this gets bad...I'd love your thoughts on how I can support him and how I can help him decide to seek help.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,08/12/2021-2:14pm","Hi Rose 63!

I think you can be pretty sure that he understands that obsessively weighing himself all throughout the day is not normal.  He probably knows that being controlled by these obsessions is not the sort of thing that's healthy for anyone.For many people with EDs, what finally gets their attention is a growing awareness that they are not in control of their behaviors anymore. This can be a pretty unsettling realization for most people with EDs, no matter how much in denial  they may have been in.  What I mean is, here's this thing that they were doing, to assure themselves about how much control they had over things, but now it's controlling them instead. Things can also reach a point where there's no longer any room in their heads for anything other than their thoughts about eating and food.  At some point people with EDs can begin to worry about that as well.  How that in the past there was a large variety of things they used to enjoy and be able to think about. And how that's no longer the case anymore.I think you are right in feeling that it's probably not your place to point these things out to him, and that to have any effect, these are realizations he may have to come to on his own.  ""Go get therapy"" and all that.  Which seems obvious of course, but again, it may need to be his own decision.You could say ""I know there must be a lot of things you are thinking about.""

I love to cook and make food for others and go out for dinner... and although he also enjoys the act of cooking/experience of a restaurant, I really miss sharing a meal with my partner. I have brought up seeking professional help in the past and he agrees that he needs it, but there has not been a true effort to do that.

7,07/09/2021,Troublepersuadingmygirlfriendtoeat,Concerned-Party,"Ok so first off I was already really big into nutrition, eating healthy, all that. I have a pretty good understanding about how many calories someone needs for their body weight, how many micronutrients, the different hormones involved like leptin, all that. I feel like I’m personally pretty reasonable when it comes to food and nutrition.This is where my issue comes in.A while ago I started dating my current girlfriend, I really love her and I care for her a lot. I suspected something was up for a while but I didn't want to pry and let her come out and tell me it, and she did a few months ago when she told me she had an eating disorder. This was very worrisome for me because my grandfather died of complications due to malnutrition during childhood growing up in war torn europe, and I do not want something like that to happen to her. I've been as supportive as I can be, helping educating some basics of proper nutrition and how important it is and I've tried to be as both supportive and helpful as possible. I'm the only person she's told, but she plans to get help relatively soon and bring it up during a therapy session (she goes to therapy every so often for other reasons that are probably related but I'm not gonna get into).The problem is this: I'm trying to encourage her to eat more as she drastically under eats daily. Some days she's pretty good but more often than not she's under eating. Her metabolic system is basically shot and she rarely gets hungry, and she gets full very easily. She's agreed that she'd do her best to get at least one substantial meal every day, however I have trouble with this. Often times she'll eat a light snack and nothing else and keeps insisting that she's ""eaten today"" when she really needs to eat more. I'm really worried for her physical health, her emotional state and the healthiness of our relationship. How do I persuade her to eat at least a bit more when she refuses to? Any help on the matter will be greatly appreciated, thanks.",Annet,"Sun,07/18/2021-8:56pm","I perfectly understand your concern but as a survivor from an eating disorder, I can tell you ""inviting her to eat"" or even forcing her will only cause problems in the relationship.
Better invite her to get proper treatment and ask her how you can better support her. Most of the times what we want is ""to feel normal"" and others to ""avoid putting too much attention to what we eat/don't"".Of course, you can show her with your example how eating healthy is. Education does not cause any damage.Cheers

8,05/18/2021,GirlfriendwithEDbrokeupwithmeouttheblue,Savill26,"Hi all, I’ve seen quite a few similar posts on here which I’ve read through, but for my own peace of mind just wanted to post/ask about my own experience. My ex has been suffering ED since well before we met, but it was something we were both aware of from early on in the relationship. My mum had severe anorexia when I was younger and thought I might be in a better position to provide support for her. As with many of the posts I’ve seen, I thought our relationship was in a great place. We were both deeply in love, I had a connection that I’d never felt with anyone else before and both of us seemed to believe that it would go the distance. There were obviously times when the ED was hard, it was difficult for her when I went to exercise, or for some social situations. She also often had suicidal or self-harm thoughts. The last time we were together was on Boxing Day, and it was one of the happiest days we’ve had together. After that we went into lockdown (didn’t live together), so we were unable to meet at all. In that time we messaged and calls most days and I never got the sense anything was particularly wrong. Suddenly, after 3 weeks in lockdown, she calls me out the blue and starts talking about how bad the ED has made her feel about herself, how she needs to focus on recovering on her own, how she needs to focus fully on her final 6 months at uni. The whole thing completely shocked me and all I can really remember is how matter of fact and certain she sounded about everything. I can definitely come to terms with certain parts of that, like why you’d want to push someone away or feel like you need to work on it alone for a while etc. I just don’t understand how her feelings could have changed that quickly. Is it common for that to happen? Or was her ED confusing her? Or is it more complicated than that, perhaps that she doesn’t feel like she can or should love someone in her state? This question has been bugging me for months. I feel guilty, but part of me wishes that she had seemed more sad about it. We haven’t been in contact that much, on occasion I’ve reached out when I feel really depressed (for better or for worse). It still sounds like she’s sure of her choice. She says that she does miss me and cares about me, but she’s not said anything about actually feelings for me. She also mentioned that she thought she might be gay now. How should I react to hearing things like this? And what might be causing her feelings and emotions to be fluctuating like this?I obviously miss and love her deeply, and after 4 months am still struggling to let go. I feel like I know more about what she’s going through than most of her friends and family and I genuinely want to be there for her. Like I said, she says she still misses me and cares about me, but hasn’t made any effort to reach out in the last 4 months. Do I take this as a sign that she doesn’t actually need me, or that it’s actually a really tough time for her and I need to find a different way of letting her know that I can be there for her?Thanks in advance for any comments and thoughts.",BobJ48,"Wed,05/19/2021-4:19pm","Yes, the ""pushing away"" thing.  I'm sure you've seen it mentioned over an over here, so it really is something that's common.  Common, but unsettling, that is.""I just don’t understand how her feelings could have changed that quickly. Is it common for that to happen?""People with EDs often talk about how ""fake"" they feel, and how much energy it can take to seem ""normal"".  Like they are always having to put on an act, when they are trying to ""act like themselves"".   So it's possible that those feelings became overwhelming for her, and she felt a need to cancel her relationship with you, because she was really a different person than you thought that she was and etc.  Which is ED talking I'm afraid, because often we can see the person much better than they can see themselves, when ED is in control."" I feel guilty, but part of me wishes that she had seemed more sad about it.""EDs really can have an effect on people, to a point where they can feel like there's no room in their life for emotions. Like they really have to get serious about things, you know ?  With none of this romantic foolishness.  My sense is that she would normally be feeling sad about this, but…self-discipline, you know ? ""She also mentioned that she thought she might be gay now. How should I react to hearing things like this? And what might be causing her feelings and emotions to be fluctuating like this? ""People with ED's can find themselves suffering from ""sense of self issues"".  Their thoughts are pulling them in so many directions that they can have a difficult time defining themselves.  You've seen what a wonderful person she can be, but there's also a reason that EDs are defined as a mental illness.  They can have emotionally disruptive effects way beyond just the food and the eating aspects. And yes, four months is a while to not be getting any energy from her, particularly when things seemed so good in the past. You can often hear people with EDs speak with regret about how they ruined their relationships too.  Which may be how she feels.  That she's ruined things between the two of you.  I've been in situations like that myself, where it was the other person who screwed up, through lying or through other reasons, and despite my willingness to forgive them, they don't want to have anything more to do with me or the relationship.  That the relationship reminds them of too many personal faults which they believe that they have. I'm not sure what you can do in this situation.  It's likely that she's having some real difficulties with her ED, and has a lot of ambivalence about where she wants (or is able) to take things, and that that may be what's at the heart of all this. So "" I know things may be being rough for you"" may be the best response you can give her right now, because that's likely the truth of the matter. In any case, just some thoughts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,05/11/2021,Sidelinedduringrecovery–anuncertainfuture,chris24115,"Hi there! So glad I stumbled on this forum - reading the stories from selfless partners/spouses and the heartfelt responses has made me feel far less alone in my situation.I’m currently having difficulty with my relapsed girlfriend who is nearing the end of her ED treatment. I know I should be grateful for her progress and honesty but she recently requested for space saying that she is unsure on the future of our relationship together. This is hugely conflicting because not only have I supported her through her previous recovery, and despite making my love and care for her known, she appears to have consciously moved away from giving our relationship any of her energy. I do understand the mental and physical demands of treatment and the sheer effort her recovery takes. Likewise I don’t begrudge her for putting her health first. I just want to be there for her and support her through this journey as best I can without being viewed as a taxing commitment.To give some background, my girlfriend (24) and I (28) live with our respective parents only 15 mins away from each other. We’ve been together for nearly three years. Both relatively inexperienced in relationships, we had a long period of infatuation that possibly bordered on codependency. From the start she was very forthcoming about her struggles with her ED (atypical anorexia nervosa) and other health issues such as depression and anxiety. In 2017, briefly before we met, she came out of inpatient treatment and was tightly sticking to a set dietary standard. For all intents and purposes she had it under control. It was challenging but knowing it what was keeping her well was enough for her to take it seriously, and for me to be enamoured with her strength, willpower and confidence.Problems arose in August 2020 when a diagnoses of CFS/ME, meant that maintaining her commitments became more and more hard work. Not even she knows the exact trigger, but this fuelled her eating disorder and old habits of over-exercising, calorie-counting and general dissatisfaction around her body image arose. New professionals told her that this diet she kept was actually a form of restrictive eating and exacerbated the disorder. She was now conflicted, frightened and unable to get treatment freely as our health service prioritise ED support almost solely on weight. In short, she did not look sick enough to help.Fast forward to Feb 2021 and she sought support for herself from private day clinic. She took time off work and began with video calls five days a week for a few weeks (owing to COVID-19), but has more recently scaled down to weekly sessions of one video call day and one in-person day at the treatment centre. This treatment is due to finish next week and a new hour-long therapy session per week has been arranged going forward.While it’s incredibly encouraging that a good portion of ‘normality’ has returned in her life - she is back at work, finding freedom with food, going out with friends etc - our connection only seems to have only degraded. Our frequent messages, calls, FaceTime’s and trips out just a few months ago, have fizzled to just a couple of paltry texts a day. I try my best to encourage her with affirmations and token gestures, but I am now starting to worry about the impact of this long-term lack of intimacy and communication.There have been points in our relationship where my naivety to ED’s and relationships in general has verged on insensitive. One instance recently I candidly told her that my needs weren’t being met. My intent was not to prompt shame or disregard the severity of her own situation, it was just my way of trying to keep the communication between us open and honest, despite it being confronting. This upset her massively and I’m regretful of how I handled that situation. I feel like this is partly why she is now reaching out to friends rather than me for support. I should be grateful that she has such a supportive team of people, but I can’t shake the feeling she is rallying the troops for a difficult conversation that may lay ahead. Maybe she is viewing recovery as a form of self-renewal and believes I was in love with the ‘still unwell’ version of herself. Or perhaps she genuinely does feel like she cannot give me what I need right now so has taken the decision to put the relationship on ice to work through what she wants.Either way, I have no idea how long I’m going to be waiting, what exactly I’m waiting for, or what to do for the best. I want to remain loyal to her request for space because ultimately I love and respect her in her entirety, ED or not. I don’t want to risk a knee-jerk reaction by demanding a conversation for fear of jeopardising progress in both our relationship and her recovery. However my support network are quick to point out the effects that this situation has had on my own mental health and that my needs do require being met for the relationship to work.It’s worth noting that not only did I lose my job at the beginning of the pandemic, I also lost a close relative and another suffered a brain injury. This has led to me putting a lot of pressure on my partner for my own happiness. While aware it was unhealthy, the relationship provided a sense of escapism which I think added to the the stressors and pressure which I am now missing an outlet for.Currently I’m working on bettering myself and hitting personal goals, but putting my future in my partner’s hands is proving increasingly difficult to manage.",BobJ48,"Wed,05/12/2021-10:19pm","If you've read some notes here, I suspect that you've seen that this ""pushing away"" thing is super-common.  We can beat ourselves up over small comments we've made, and try and discover what we may have done to cause it.  But really, you've probably also noticed how kind and caring most of the guys here have been, when they write and mention their situations.  So it would probably be wrong to try and take on too much responsibility for what's happened, or get too wrapped up in ""if only""s.This is just a guess of course, but she may be feeling tentative and doubtful about her recovery, even though she's getting therapy, and etc. I may be wrong about this, but it's possible. People in that position aren't looking for affirmations, or "" I know you can do it !"".  They are often uneasy, and worried about what their future may be. While I know you are trying to avoid being demanding, she may hate the idea that she has to live up to anyone's expectations, either positive, or negative or whatever.  What I mean is, your only sin may be that you are another human being.Probably the best thing you could say is ""I know things may be rough for you now.""  Because they probably are. Which that's what you are looking for now ; things that you can agree on, you know ?And ugh, sorry to hear about all the things you have been through yourself.  It's not out of line for you to hope for some support from her, and I'd not be surprised if she's been trying to give you some.  If anything, people with EDs often understand hard times, so hopefully she's not been turning away from you where that part is concerned. Otherwise, you may just have to wait out this phase of things.   Perhaps she'll want to break up, or maybe she'll what to stick with things.  But it sounds to me like things aren't being all that great with her recovery, and when people are unsettled in that situation, it can be hard for them to commit to anything.",chris24115,"Fri,05/14/2021-10:43am","Thanks BobJ, I really appreciate your response.I totally get the ‘pushing away’ thing. It’s a tough situation, especially when it feels like you’re the only one it is happening to. I seek solace in the fact that it’s not likely to be personal and that this is behaviour typical of someone in my partner’s position.Truth be told, I don’t know a huge amount about what is going on in her world or her head right now. And because that communication isn’t currently there, I can only follow her lead and reciprocate contact from an ‘outsiders’ perspective. Following your response I’m holding back on the affirmations and mainly just focussing on acknowledging her situation to make her feel heard when she does message. Even then I feel like I’m overthinking my responses, but I’m endeavouring to keep things light and in the present.In the meantime, I’m willing to carry on waiting and trust that I will know when it’s time to adopt a more proactive response to the distance.

Like it can help us adjust what might be our normal approach, so we end up learning things too.As to what's going on in her head, a lot of self-doubts, probably.  EDs tell a person that they absolutely should be doing one thing, while their rational mind lets them know that they should be doing another.  The clash between those two things can be really unsettling for the person, and when people are unsettled…that's when ED loves to pounce. Which can make for some really tangled feedback loops. Loops which are hard for outsiders to influence, and where  "" I know things may be difficult now""  can often feel like the most understanding  response.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,05/03/2021,GirlfriendUnmotivatedAfterMonthsofRecovery,TheFlopster,"I wrote on here once a few months back. My girlfriend of almost a year and a half has been in and out of ED treatement over the past few months. She's a freshman in college like I am. She had to defer last semester, and this semester she did her classes in the online format. Needless to say, she missed out on a lot of stuff. More recently, she has been doing her recovery via zoom with her team of therapists, dieticians, etc. and she was given an ultimatum that if she did not meet her weekly meal goals in the next two weeks, they would look into intensive inpatient care, where she would be admitted into a facility and be monitored all day every day for 5-10 weeks. I say all of that just to paint a picture of the situation she's in. She missed so many things over the past 6 months that she had been looking forward to doing. She is feeling particularly unmotivated to meet her recovery goals because she feels like she is stuck an endless pattern of ""spiral downhill, seek help, make improvements, repeat."" She simply doesnt want to go to a facility with full-time care because she's missed so many things in her life already, she's just sick of it. And I totally get that. But I'm just so tired of watching the ED win her over repeatedly. Surely fighting like hell and missing out on a few things here and there is worth eradicating the ED from her life for good, right? I think she knows that, but she is just so tired of trying and falling short each time. I'm simply asking what I can do to help her when she feels stuck in a hole and too tired to dig herself out. She will beat this, I absolutely know it. And she knows she will, too, but the fight is brutal, it's long, and it is certainly not easy. I'm not even the one having to fight the ED but this has been one of the most challenging moments of my life. Any feedback is much appreciated. God bless.",BobJ48,"Mon,05/03/2021-2:46am","Hey there, ""Surely fighting like hell and missing out on a few things here and there is worth eradicating the ED from her life for good, right?""
 Yes, you would think so, but at the same time people can get really discouraged. Particularly if they've been through a big string of ups and downs. So yeah, it can be easy to lose their motivation, particularly if they are dealing with depression as well.Keep in mind the idea that EDs are often about accomplishment. Or they were when the person first got into them. Boy oh boy; seeing that weight go down, or at least striving to see it.  So the theme of accomplishment can be a big one for them.  Recovery can involve the theme of accomplishment too, and yet if they feel that they are constantly failing at it…you can see when they might lose their will to proceed.So it's like you said, "" she is just so tired of trying and falling short each time.""Also, people with EDs can get that ""all or nothing"" kind of mind set, from when they first got going with their ED.  The numbers on the scale go  down, and they can feel that they are on top of things.  The numbers on the scale go up, and they are a total failure.  When your brain gets used to thinking in those terms, it's hard for it to change it's outlook, and feel any sort of satisfaction with shades of gray, or with  uncertain progress.  So they have a lot of mental stuff to fight against when it comes to those ways of looking at things."" I'm not even the one having to fight the ED but this has been one of the most challenging moments of my life."" I know what you mean, and to be honest it's not selfish or self-centered of you to be feeling this way. We care about the person, so we want to feel like we're actually adding something positive to the situation. And when it feels like we aren't…I'm sure I don't have to tell you how that can feel.
I've been in this gig for many years now, and talk with a lot of people who are in your GF's situation.  Like yourself, I've had to struggle with how to go about being supportive in ways where the person actually feels supported.And it's been my experience that what feels good to people is when they feel understood.  So I'm not all ""Oh I know you can do this !! "" or necessarily being  all positive about things.  I'm more like "" I know this must be discouraging"", or ""I know this must suck.""  ""I know you must worry about what the future may hold.""This may seem like taking a negative rather than a positive approach, but actually people seem to feel better when they feel that the other person gets it about them, and gets it about what they are going through. Because EDs can be lonely things, and while we can't really fix other people, we can help them to feel understood. And there can be comfort in that, if that makes any sense ?In any case, just some thoughts.Keep writing ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,04/26/2021,Supportingmygfthroughherrecovery,AS9797,"My gf and I have been dating for about a month now. She has been open about having an ED since our first date. She is happy to tell me facts about it, etc. But, when it comes to her struggles and feelings with it, that is a different story. Like for example, Saturday night she insisted she was fine. Then, she went to the bathroom for a long time and I later figured out she had been crying the whole time. I tried to talk to her about it, but she refused to tell me what was wrong. She finally said it was ED related when I asked, but she wouldn't tell me how she was feeling, or what had happened. She just said she did something stupid. I feel very shut off when this happens. It feels almost like she is trying to push me away. She says it feels like I don't care, which I really don't understand. She has admitted in the past that she doesn't think it's something I do, but I feel like I need to change my approach. I tell her I'm there for her, ready to talk about it. But, if she won't tell me specifically what is going on, I feel like I have to make super generalized statements and really don't know what to say. I feel like I just end up saying the same things over and over. I ask if there is anything I can do and she says there is nothing. I do feel like part of it is a self esteem issue. I have a hard time believing people care about me as well. I know I can't fix the problems, nor is that my goal. I not be able to help directly, but I want her to feel loved and supported. Any advice would mean the world to me. Thank you!",BobJ48,"Mon,04/26/2021-12:57pm","Hey there.  I'm glad you took the time to write.And yes, EDs and the way sufferers deal with them can seem mysterious alright. I'm not sure what your GF's behaviors were before, but it's not too difficult to imagine what must have happened in the bathroom. My guess is that she may have  had a bulimic episode, which if this is not a normal behavior for her, can feel like a big failure to the person.You are also right about how there are ""the facts"" and then there are the feelings that the person is having. And you are right about the self-esteem issue too. What seems to us like them acting like a normal day-to-day person, can feel to them like they are struggling, and are barely able to put up an acceptable social front.  Because of what horrible human beings they actually are, and etc.  Not horrible because they have an ED, but just horrible and unworthy in general.  This crumbling of self-esteem is really common among people with EDs, and is one of it's most unfortunate symptoms, because as I suspect you've seen, your GF is not a horrible person at all. "" But, if she won't tell me specifically what is going on, I feel like I have to make super generalized statements and really don't know what to say.""I talk with a lot of people who have EDs, and for myself, I don't really need to know the details. All I really need to know is that the person is struggling. And as you might expect, I make a lot of super-generalized statements too.  Which despite not being particularly specific, can be fine, and a comfort to people.  "" I know things must be difficult now ""….I mean, how general is that ?  And yet it's a true statement, and people can feel a little bit better, knowing that someone else understands that part. "" I may not be able to help directly, but I want her to feel loved and supported.""Well exactly.  While we may not be able to come up with an actual ""thing"" we can do, support is something that we can provide. Depending on how much of that the person will allow, of course.   My sense has always been that our best responses come when we try and put ourselves in the other person's shoes.  Like we can't necessarily think of something that another person can ""do"" for us, but if we feel like the other person understands us and our situation a little, then that's where the comfort comes from I think.

12,04/20/2021,WorriedaboutmypartnerED,Johnn-towns,"Hello, my partner suffers from a ED I assume. We have been together coming up 9 years and when I first met her she was X stone .. at the age of 17. She struggled putting on weight or eating proper meals and enough food. As the years gone on I promised my self to help her gain weight, now she’s 25 and we have moved out to our own place she has put on weight and now she’s at X stone which she is only Xft so she isn’t very tall. So Iv been so proud of her Anyway her life is hectic, stress with her family mainly her mother suffers from depression and neglect from her father and sister who has things going on and throwing getting comments to my partner about her weight etc. So the only positive things she has is friends and me so I can see where her depression started. So sometimes she has good weeks and some times there really bad but she can not look at her self in the mirror without knocking her self sick. Everyday it’s in her mind that her weight or body isn’t correct for a 24 year own women and sometimes she can’t even leave the house or do things that she would love todo. Some meal times are hard she doesn’t know what she wants or when she eats it’s only something small or she can’t get half way through a normal meal. At times she doesn’t want to eat and it frustrates her because she really wants to but her her mind making her feel sick just looking at her food. When she does have good times it’s eating X which she can have a good amount no problem. I’m just looking for some advice because I’d do anything for this girl. Iv now ordered some weight gainers just to experiment. She will never ever be happy unless her gains weight and it’s been that long Iv tries my hardest to support her but it feels like I’m drowning im running out of options or ideas. There is plenty more to say but I’ll leave it as this for now thank you for any advice",_admin_moderator,"Wed,04/21/2021-5:11pm","Dear Johnn-towns, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove weight, heigt numbers as well as specific food items, as these could be triggering to other users.

14,04/02/2021,Partnerrelapsing,holzi,"First time talking about this to anyone...my partner has said they're struggling bad at the minute and is seeking professional help again (they're good like that).I was a little surprised and hurt that they didn't tell me they were struggling before. I know it's an ongoing thing but I thought their recovery was still going well and am annoyed at myself for not noticing things were getting bad again. Little habits I've noticed have started to creep back in. Like I bought three different types of small canned cocktails for us and they chose the only one which had the caloric content stated. They said it was a comfort thing, to know how much they were consuming. A few years ago when things were really dire, I remember them telling me certain foods affected their periods (and, like an idiot, I bought into it), but really they were just scared of the calories. It was very worryingAnyway, just venting a little I guess. I'm scared things are going to get REALLY bad again, like they were a few years ago when we were trying to date for the first time. The disease consumed them so much they literally didn't have it in them to continue the relationship with me. When we got together properly in the summer of 2020, they promised they were better now and they'd never, ever let themselves get that sick again. I truly believed they meant it when they said they were better but I very quickly discovered that wasn't the case.I'm glad they get help when they need it but they don't believe they'll ever overcome those thoughts and that it's all about ignoring those thoughts, not getting rid of them. I'm just so scared they'll die young. That's my ultimate fear, that even if they do 'recover', all the damage they've done to themselves will ultimately end in a premature death. Their liver is already very damaged and their skin is often yellow, so I know organs have been affected. According to their doctor, they're a 'healthy weight' at the moment, but there's still no periods. They've just started running again and dancing most nights and doing up to 3 hours of yoga. I think it's too much for a recovering body. I'm hoping this is just a setback, not a full blown relapse because I don't believe our relationship will survive it a second time. My anxiety is sky-high and I'm trying so hard not to let it show because they are the most sensitive person in the world and have said so many times they don't ever want to be a burden on me. They aren't, but this disease is. It's affected everything. I'm not the one suffering with it but it's on my mind all day everyday as well. We don't even live together yet, but plan to at the end of this year. This worries me, because they eat well when we're together for the one full day we get a week when we're not at work, but I know they have many secret eating habits that I don't see but will be hard to hide when we live together. I hate that this is something I have to think about. It's like a third member of the relationship, we've even named that part of their brain! I hate it and feel so guilty at the thought that I truly don't know if I would have gotten back with them had I know they were still suffering. I love them so much but I'm not sure my own mental health can cope with this for the rest of our lives.Sorry if that was a lot, it's just a bit tough at the moment.",_admin_moderator,"Sat,04/03/2021-10:20am","Hi holzi, Welcome to the forums!

""No kidding, ED's effect everyone who's involved, so I hope you won't feel bad about the fact that you care about this as much as you do.  It's unsettling, it's true, but it's also a reflection of the caring sort of person you are.  So I hope you can see it from that angle too. As far as the relapse goes : That can happen.  She may have honestly thought she was past it all, but as you are seeing, it can come back again too.Who knows what the trigger was.  Maybe she felt she was ""undeserving"" of being your partner, or having a relationship at all. People can become worried about that.  Rather than you telling her that you think she's wonderful, and trying to reassure her (which is our natural inclination in situations like this) instead  you may want to say ""I know you may worry about how our relationship might go.""But yes, all the running and yoga and etc ; People can equate that with ""being in control"" and ""being good enough"".  It's not an ego thing, it's often an insecurity thing, where they are trying to reassure themselves of their self-worth.
Which only they can do.  Our efforts to reassure them often don't do anything.
But what can feel reassuring is when they fell that someone else ""gets it"" about what they are going through.  Which is often a lot of self-doubt, and worries about the future.  ""I know you must worry about what the future may hold.""  That may not be the sort of cheery outlook that we're all supposed to take these days, but she'll feel less alone with her feelings if she knows that you understand that.
And yes, it's authentically hopeful that she's seeking help. ""Taking a step for ourself"" is a very good thing to hear that she's doing, so I think you can draw hope from that as well.

So here it is below.",Codman123,"Wed,03/31/2021-3:44pm","HiSorry if this is poorly written, I’ve never been a great writer and apologies as I may have missed out details of their recent relapse of ED as we only spoke about it once when we broke up so I was pretty emotional at the time and I’m not sure I know the full extent of their suffering. I’ll give a little background to fill you in. We met just over 1 year ago and it was everything I could have wished for in a relationship. We were apart for 2 months because of a national lockdown, and afterwards we lived together for 3/4 months. In September of last year we had to move to a long distance relationship (around 2 hours) and we managed perfectly, seeing each other at least every fortnight. We last saw each other just before Christmas and multiple things have prevented us from meeting up since. These include their housemates having to be especially careful with COVID as they were teachers and nurses, as well as their ever growing workload that comes with being at university. On my end helping my parents to build their new house would also take up a lot of my time so I was also to blame. However initially this year things were normal, we would FaceTime a couple of times per week and we would message each other around 30 times every day, so it was quite intense but I feel that was needed to maintain a long distance relationship. But over time, specifically since their exams were over (they have anxiety for which exam season is a particular trigger) we would talk less and less. We stopped FaceTiming completely and they’d only send me 2 messages per day, which were typically either answers to my questions or one lined responses, which would avoid any emotional content so I’d end up having to carry the conversation. This continued for around a month or two before I asked to meet them on their way home from university. This is where they explained to me that they were suffering with a purging ED. They mentioned feelings of being overwhelmed, not being able to give 100% and that I deserved someone better than them, all I assume stemming from the ED, for reasons that they were going to break up with me, despite me offering to try and help them with the situation. They even said I was free to hate them for how they hadn’t been a good partner and encouraged me to block them on social media. They found it especially difficult when I had mentioned to them about a month prior that I was struggling long distance and that it would amount to almost 4 months between seeing each other. They felt that I shouldn’t have to go through this with them as we’d been through too much already and that our relationship was a case of right person wrong time. In addition they mentioned control, as they couldn’t control when we could see each other so they then focused on controlling their weight as that is the only way they could be ‘perfect’ for me. Something I didn’t notice at the time but upon reading other posts I realised that they were lacking emotion when talking to me which seems common with people suffering from an ED. I asked if we could just take a break and they said they couldn’t commit to being ready at a certain point. I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do would be to respect their decision and give them some space and time, especially as they had mentioned seeking help on helplines and forums. However they trusted me with this bit of information as they haven’t told anyone about the relapse, not even their family. My partner had mentioned to me mid way through our relationship that they had suffered with a restrictive ED when they were in their early to mid teens. They were almost hospitalised with it if I remember correctly but they managed to overcome it without any treatment for their mental health so if I’m right it was never dealt with at the root cause. In their family it is never spoken of, and all pictures have been either deleted or binned from that time so they have had hardly anyone to speak to about this. In addition to this they have struggled with anxiety after a serious case is septicaemia (this was just as we began seeing each other), but as a couple we worked through this and they got professional help for this. It also hasn’t helped that over this year they have been dealing with food intolerances, so they put themselves on a very restrictive diet to find out what was causing it, and it turns out as soya and probably wheat. Anyway, now it’s been around a week since we broke up and we have had no contact. I’ve drafted a message to send to them but I was waiting at least a week to send it, just so they have had a bit of time and space. Even though I’ve seen them upload stories to their social media portraying like they’re having a good time with friends and family, I’m obviously massively worried about them, hence this post, and had a few questions about the whole situation. 1. How should I first go about contacting them, as having read other posts it can be an extremely difficult thing to do. My initial thoughts would be to just check in on how they’re doing and offer myself as an option if they wanted to ever speak about it to someone they care about, as well as make sure they’re getting the help they need.
2. Is there anything I can do to help or is it best to let them deal with it on the hotlines they have been using?
3. I’m pretty sure but it seems like the ED is the reason for our relationship failing, but part of me feels it’s cowardly to blame it on this.
4. This is very selfish of me, and I would never push them into anything if they weren’t ready, but what does the future hold for us? Is it common for couples to get back together after a period of time because I feel that this relationship is too good to let just fizzle out.",Tryingtoheal,"Wed,03/31/2021-11:35pm","Unfortunately,  it's not an option on here.",BobJ48,"Wed,03/31/2021-9:49pm",""" They even said I was free to hate them for how they hadn’t been a good partner and encouraged me to block them on social media.""Isn't this a terrible way for her to look at herself ?  That she'd be such a terrible person, that she'd be perfectly worthy of treatment like this ? It's a sad thing alright, but with EDs, quite often people find themselves feeling like this.  Unworthy of even friendships, because of what a terrible person they must be.  You saw some of this in the lack of emotion in her posts too. People can believe that things would be better if they became emotionally numb to everything. At the same time, as you saw on her social media, ""Everything's fine"".  Which it isn't, but it's much safer and causes many fewer problems to pretend that it is.  She may indeed be hanging out with friends, but not ones who know what her issues are, I bet.  But since you are the one who does know…well, it's just complicated, and things would be easier if she just set you aside.  This sounds cold, I know, but it's possible that she's just not ready to confront her situation yet, which she knows that she'd have to because…of how you care about her.  So things really can get all tangled up like that, where the fact that we care ends up being a negative rather than a positive.
Great, huh ?
As to your questions, those can be hard things too.  We would like to be of help and support to the person, but perhaps as you are finding out, it's going to depend on if they are willing to allow us to be part of things or not. So we are kind of at the person's mercy in that regard. Which can be a pretty helpless feeling for sure.
If you were to write her, I'd try and keep it brief instead of going into things too deeply.  I would not mention how much you miss her, or  say anything that implies that you are in emotional pain yourself. You might want to mention that you understand that it may feel safer to her to limit her contact with you, because that's probably just how she feels. Not because you are a bad guy, but more because you know too much.  Which of course should not be a negative either, but if she has a lot of ambivalence about her ED…she may not want to get into that with anyone now.
So I'd just try and keep things fairly light, if you were to write to her.  If you want to mention the ED, I'd just say that you know she may be struggling with things, and that you know that that can be a difficult thing. And leave it at that. Also, she already knows that you have affection for her, so I would not go into that too much either. Basically I'd say that you'll always welcome hearing from her, so that you are leaving that part up to her.
Because yeah; she's still dancing around the idea that you know about her ED. Is she going to see that as a good thing…or a problem ?
It's a drag when we have to leave things up to the other person like this, but that may be your best strategy now.",Codman123,"Thu,04/01/2021-3:26am","Thank you very much for your reply, it’s some very useful insight. I feel as if I need to write to her as by not doing that I feel like I’m giving up on her, which is the last thing I want to do as I know how great she is. I feel there’s such a fine line between being there for her enough and me giving too much so that she completely shuts me out!
Thank you so much again",BobJ48,"Thu,04/01/2021-11:56am","Codman,Yes, you put your finger on the issue I think. How do we show that we care, without the person pushing us away ?  As you said, it can feel like a really fine line.
Then there's the part where we can start being hard on ourselves, and blaming ourselves for ""not saying the right thing"", almost as though we deserve to think poorly of ourselves for caring.  It can get kind of ridiculous that way.
None the less, sometimes you'll hear people talk about how they appreciate that their partners stuck with them when they being a ( the ""B-word"" here).  So it's probably reasonable to still give some credit to how things were when it felt like you guys did have a connection.
So in one sense, you don't want to let ED bully and intimidate you, and make you feel lousy about yourself. On the other hand we probably don't want to intrude too much either.
"" I know that things may still be kind of rough, so I want you to know that I'm still thinking of you.""

What I mean is, on some level it should be OK to expect that we can engage in regular every-day sort of conversation, rather than our feeling like we have to walk on eggshells with every sentence, or have an advanced degree in psychology in order to communicate with the person.  That's just not how life or relationship should have to go, you know ?
Having said that, I'll admit that certain strategies may be better than others.  As you said, the person is in a sensitive situation, and we don't want to put too much pressure on them.
For example, we know how terrible someone is feeling.  They've been our friend for a while, and we've exchanged notes with them in the past, and then suddenly….nothing.  In my head, I'm worried, because I know they've done certain ""rash things"" in the past.  So it's true;  I'm worried if they are still alive or not.
But…I don't want them to feel like I'm pacing the floor with worry.  Which would not be an unusual response on my part. But even so,  I don't want them to feel like our friendship is a burden on me - one which they are responsible for.
So right - How do we craft a note to them in circumstances like that ?  Or if we do finally hear from them, do we just pretend that we weren't worried ?
Which actually is our best stance I think. Maybe there are circumstances which would cause any person to worry.  But not us, you know ?  We are sustained by a certain inner confidence that things will be fine.  I was on a board with parents once, and you can imagine how they must feel seeing their kids go through things like this.  Their feeling was that you have to ""Act like a Redwood"".  The winds can blow, and the storms will come, but they just continue to be sturdy, like it's not upsetting them.
Maybe we don't have to be as dramatic about it as that, but their feeling was that a ""Don't let 'em see you sweat"" - type of position was what was the most helpful in the long run.
 So when I don't want to put pressure on someone, I'll just talk about a nice hike I went on, or show them a picture of a nice sunset I saw.  Or mention how my garden is growing.  Things like this show that I care, but don't involve ""getting into it"" if you see what I mean ?  Plus, I actually did go on a nice hike, and I did see a nice sunset, so I don't feel like I'm BSing in any way either.",Codman123,"Sat,04/03/2021-3:47am","I see where you’re coming from, the analogy with the friend really resonated with me and I completely get the Redwood tree (funnily enough in the house I grew up in there was a redwood tree and I can’t remember it blowing in the wind once). And actually that’s what’s helped me most with the breakup, as talking about other things with friends has made me feel more comfortable than delving into the subject.
She’s got back to me this evening and she admitted that she’s not been doing too well and that recovery is going to be a long process. She also asked how I was doing which I feel is a good opportunity to apply the advice you mentioned above. I’ll tell her about a couple of things I’ve been up to. One last question, and I know it may seem like you are baby feeding me at this point, but is it worth letting her know that I’d like to stay in contact with her, as long as she’s ok with that. I’m sorry but I’m still trying to get to terms with the not trying to step on egg shells, I’m sure it will come with time!
I can’t thank you enough for all of this and all of the good work you’ve been doing for others on this forum, it’s been massively helpful.
UPDATE
She has got back to me this morning and mentioned that with all her uni work that she’s completely overwhelmed and that me messaging her puts added pressure onto her. So I guess for now she wants to shut me out and there’s nothing I can do but respect that decision.",BobJ48,"Sat,04/03/2021-1:29pm","""She has got back to me this morning and mentioned that with all her uni work that she’s completely overwhelmed and that me messaging her puts added pressure onto her. ""Yes, and when yesterday things seemed hopeful.  So I think you are seeing more of how EDs can effect people.  One day staying in touch and sharing feelings feels important, and then the next day…it doesn't sound like such a good idea.  People with EDs can feel conflicted about this, and that's where some of the pressure comes from.  Not so much from you wanting to engage, but from inside themselves, trying to decide what feels safe to them.  By that I mean, not that you as a person are unsafe, but whether or not she feels it's safe for her to be thinking about her situation at all.
Which is how it can be when things get rough for people.  It can feel like the best approach would be to just try and ignore it all. But when it's messing a person's life up, and intruding on their minds in the persistent ways that EDs do, ""just ignoring it"" can be extremely hard to do.  So I think what you are seeing are her back-and-forth struggles with that.
And you are a liability, because you do know how serious it is.
On the one hand she trusted you with the knowledge so that she would not be alone with it,  but on the other hand, she probably wishes that nobody knew.  So again, it's the back and forth thing. Which is probably some of what she meant when she said she was not doing too well.
I'm not sure if you should stop writing her or not. On the one hand, it's unhealthy for her to be shutting you out.  You've seen how exciting it is to get a message from her.  For her, seeing your name in her inbox may be exciting too, but more in a "" I don't want to have to think about any of this"" sort of way, no matter how friendly your notes may be. In any case, I would not give up hope.  EDs do a pretty good job of bullying everyone who's involved, so try not to let this one bully you.(And yes, what about all the drama?  If we care, it can be hard not to be drawn into the drama. So keep the""Being a Redwood"" thing in mind, and see what you can do to keep your perspective, and a tad bit of emotional distance from the moment-to-moment aspects of it all. )",Codman123,"Sat,04/03/2021-2:49pm","When you say she probably wishes no one knew, I believe this is spot on. I think the one of the few reasons she told me was because she had made up her mind with regards to breaking up with me, potentially believing this would relieve some of the pressure on her. This would have been extremely confusing for me to understand had she not told me about her ED. Transparency in our relationship had been extremely important to her and one of the main reasons we had been so good together.
With regards to writing to her, I think I’ll give it a couple of weeks. It’s only fair on her part that I respect her request that we don’t speak for now so hopefully that bit of time will give her the opportunity to grow and feel a little better about me offering myself for chatting. But I don’t want to give up on her that easily. What I’m getting from her responses is that she won’t be able to open up to me and start chatting regularly until her uni work has settled down, and I know her term doesn’t end until mid June which seems way too long to go without at least checking in. It’s just hard as at least for now I guess I’ll never know what stage of recovery she’s at. I don’t even know when it first started, although I do have my guesses."
16,03/25/2021,Concernedaboutgirlfriend'seatinghabits,jake1112,"My girlfriend of four months is a very picky eater. She is a vegetarian, and she does not like certain foods and many other things. She is also extremely thin. When I introduced her to my parents, ""your girlfriend looks malnourished"" was not the response I was hoping for. She does eat a mix of foods. When she eats, she eats very slowly, cutting up her food really small. She is very active, playing sports and going to the gym pretty much every day. When we are together, I feel like we only eat meals because I am hungry - she tells me she doesn't usually get hungry.Early on while we were starting to date, I told her that I was concerned about her eating habits, but she said ""Don't worry about me, I am getting enough food."" I let it go, since, after all, if she had an eating disorder, she would not eat certain foods, right? And I wanted to believe her, too. Eating disorders are very serious business.Recently, I brought it up with her again, and I asked her to humor me and take the NEDA eating disorder screening test. She took it and it showed that she was not at risk. She said she's always ate like this, she's never lost a lot of weight in a short amount of time. She seemed pretty taken aback, and I felt bad for accusing her. I want to believe her and I want to believe the test, but I can't shake my feelings. She doesn't feel sick - she never gets sick, in fact. And she's always full of energy -- I've never seen her get tired. She is an excellent endurance athlete. She exercises like an athlete, but she does not eat like an athlete. Again, not all the foods she doesn't eat are unhealthy. She also doesn't like one type of food, and she does like other types. But I am concerned that her food intake is falling short of her body's needs. Is this just picky eating, or should I continue to push her to ask her doctor or a nutritionist?",BobJ48,"Thu,03/25/2021-5:07pm","Jake,Yeah, it's hard to tell what's going on.  It's true that some people are naturally thin.  And of course we're all supposed to be concerned about ""health"" and ""healthy eating"".  And golly, aren't we all supposed to be going to the gym every day ?  And feel guilty if we aren't doing so ?  Isn't this the sort of thing that society envies ?Of course it is.  But it can also provide an acceptable cover for behaviors that aren't necessarily healthy too.I went out with someone like this once. She was a highly accomplished athlete, and had won all sorts of statewide trophies.  But at the same time she would lie, and be deceptive about matters that were extremely important to our relationship.  I liked her, and think about her still, many years later. But she had a lot of problems which continue to get in the way of her having a full life. I'm not sure what the situation is with your partner.  People who have all sorts of rigid rules for their life, and who find it difficult or impossible to be flexible those rules, what are we supposed to think about that ?For example, say for some reason she could not go to the gym for…5 days. Say she challenged herself to see if she could do that. Would she be able to cheerfully do that, like most people would, or would she find herself getting anxious and consumed with anxiety ?
Also, have you gotten any hints about how her self-esteem might be ?  People can hide that pretty well, it's true, but often things like this are tied into those kinds of issues.  Like ""Am I good enough yet ?"".  Some people can have a hard time with that, and judge themselves in ways that can cause problems. Because some people have excessive-exercise problems, and the dynamic around the thing is much like the dynamic that surrounds eating disorders.  Like they both have similar addictive and emotional aspects which is like they are half-sisters of each other.
Again, it all could be nothing, so take this with a big grain of salt.  But keep an eye on her moods, and her ability to deal with frustrations.  And how easy it is for her to be flexible with her rules and routines.Anyhow, just some thoughts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,03/05/2021,Girlfriendhasanedandsaysshedoesn'tdeservetorecoverorlive.,mekollik2,"My girlfriend has been fighting anorexia for almost three years now. She recovered once about a year ago but she is on the decline again. She has seen therapists, been hospitalized, and now goes to check-ups weekly at an ED clinic. She recently stopped going to her ED therapist because the therapist ""didn't want to talk about anything but her ED."" Both I and her mom tried explaining that once she gets through the ED, everything else will follow, but she does not want to listen. Her doctors strongly suggest that she goes into a residential program which would help her, but she is resisting and saying she does not want to go. I want to help her but she does not want to help herself. She has recently told me that she does not want to get better because she does not deserve to. She thinks of herself as a bad person that does not deserve the help. There is a spot opening up at a residential facility in 3 weeks, and her mom and I are trying to get her to go, but I don't think she will make the choice to go. She says she is scared to go because she will be alone and that terrifies her, but I can't see any other choice. She will have good days where she will eat every meal and helps me to find therapists, but the next day she shuts down; sobbing at the sign of food and not wanting to even talk about therapists and residential. I don't know what to do anymore, because she is riding on a knife's edge and her doctors are saying she is dangerously thin and her heartrate is dangerously low. I am afraid we won't be able to convince her to go to residential and that could be the death of her. Please give me some advice.",BobJ48,"Fri,03/05/2021-9:42pm","Hey there, I'm glad you decided to write."" She has recently told me that she does not want to get better because she does not deserve to. She thinks of herself as a bad person that does not deserve the help.""I work on a site for people who have EDs, and I can't even tell you the hundreds of times I've heard people say this exact same thing.  They are ""a bad person"", they are unworthy of getting help; so many people with EDs will say these very same things.Also, like you said about the knife edge situation. They'll have days when they seem be able to feel OK, and then they'll have an emotional wipe out. As you said, they can be very ambivalent about doing programs.  I can pretty much promise you that she knows she's in trouble. And that she's aware that people in her position often end up doing programs.  I'm sure she understands that.But then there's the fear thing.  How's it going to be when they maker her gain weight ?  What if she turns out to be no good at the program, and turns out to a big failure ?  Just the thought of outcomes like that can be emotionally intolerable, and maybe it would be better if she didn't go at all !So here's the thing : People who are actually bad people…they don't worry about the fact that they're bad.  It's only good people who find themselves concerned about that. Is she the sort of person who wants to see unfortunate things happen to other people ?  I bet not.  And yet people who are actually bad would never worry about such things.   She may have depression, but that doesn't mean she is a bad person.  She may worry that she's being a burden to others, but that doesn't mean that she's a bad person either.  As a person's  parents or partner, it's part of our obligation to be concerned about the people we care about.  If she had a friend who was in trouble, she'd care about them too. So how bad of a person could she really be ?As to doing a program or thinking about recovery, she's right.  It's possible that things might not work out. Which it's not unreasonable to be afraid of that.  But if a person is afraid of even trying, then that pretty much assures that things won't work out.So it's true : A person has to be willing to take a risk, and that's the idea that you may want to work on.  Will she be willing to take some risks for herself…or not ?  Because yes; things might not work out, but then again, they might.  But a person never finds out unless they take a risk.Again, I'm sure she's not happy about her ED.  Getting whipsawed around by her emotions all the time, and constantly plagued by all of those food preoccupations.  Not very many people with EDs enjoy finding themselves controlled by all that, and I imagine that she doesn't like it either. So yeah, as much as she hates the situation she's in, she probably knows that she's going to have to make some decisions.Which honestly is a scary thing.  And you can tell her that you understand that part too.Keep writing ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,02/26/2021,PushingAway,986jj,"Hi all,I'm a long-time lurker, and first time poster. My girlfriend and I have been together for over two years, and for the past year or so, her ED has been a near-constant in our relationship. After a flare-up in the spring, she opened up to me about everything, and I am the only person in her life who knows the full extent of what she is going through. Her friends are aware that for a little while, something was wrong, but they think she is more-or-less fully recovered. On the other hand, her family refuses to believe that she even has an eating disorder, and frequently make comments about her weight and eating habits.Despite a less-than-ideal living situation, she has made great strides in recent months. Days of intense behaviors are in the rear-view, and now, her eating and exercise habits are much more sustainable and healthy. Things are not perfect - portions are still precisely measured, body image is still a major issue, etc. - but they have gradually improved with the passage of time. So much so that, as of a few weeks ago, she told me she felt the healthiest she has felt in a long time, and that she wanted to try expanding her diet to allow her to regain some of the weight she initially lost.Naturally, I was pumped to hear this. I love her unconditionally, and any decision to lose or gain weight won't affect that in the slightest. But even still, it felt like such an important milestone on her road to recovery. She was hopeful as well, but more than anything she was, understandably, really scared. Fast forward about a week or so. She has a busy stretch at school, and starts to cancel plans. We still saw each other a few times, or at least FaceTimed for a few minutes when things were really stressful. I know how hectic midterm season can be, so this was, in a sense, expected, and totally okay. Within a few days though, reaching her became almost impossible, and any attempts to make plans were being shut down. By the end of the week, we ended up going for a drive. She broke up with me, saying that I deserved more than what she had to offer me, that she wasn't good enough, that she needed to learn how to love herself before she could love someone else.I was caught by surprise, but not totally shocked. We had also taken a break when she was going through the initial rough patch last spring, and the reasons she provided then were more or less identical. Realizing this, I started to put two and two together, and now suspect that the breakup was a way to push me away, likely because of her ED, and possibly because of the stress she is feeling about her desire to take a leap forward and put on weight. I've also read up quite a bit on the topic, and this seems to be a pretty common response for people in similar situations - to push away people who are already deeply involved in the process, sometimes for fear of disappointing them, or not wanting to let go of their ED just yet, even if they know it is the right thing to do (Having battled addiction in the past, and can definitely relate to this).We agreed to stay friends, and texted back and forth - almost as if nothing had happened - for the next 24 hrs or so. We even hung out again two nights later. Everything felt natural. Nothing affectionate, but we both had a really great time, and she told me as much at the end of the night. She has had a difficult time with affection for a few months now, so when she hugged me tightly for a really long time before leaving, I felt so happy, and thought that maybe this was all just a necessary bump in the road, and that everything would be just fine. She even told me she realized that she was pushing people away, and that she was going to make an effort to be more accepting of people's help by not doing it anymore.So we made plans to see each other again a few days later, but they fell through. The connection that felt restored just a few nights earlier had suddenly evaporated again, and by the end of the week, she was ignoring calls and texts. Finally, she reached out on the weekend to let me know that she decided to go stay with a friend in another town for the next two weeks, and that she wouldn't be able to see me for a while. She said she's not sure if she wants to be friends, and that maybe we shouldn't talk anymore - at least for a really, really long time until she feels ready. I can't help but feel that this is an attempt to push me even further away. It is like she knows that I want to help, and that I'm the only one who knows what she's going through (I don't mean to sound as if I know what her ED feels like, but rather that I am the only one whom she regularly opens up to about it). It almost feels as if she would rather lose me than lose her ED. This makes me feel confused and a bit sad, but I am not upset, nor am I willing to lose hope. What she is going through is not her fault.It's been a week since she left town, and we have managed to communicate a little bit - mostly just discussing our situation. She talks as if she wants to totally cut me off and get over our relationship entirely, which I am having a hard time accepting, especially considering just a few weeks ago, everything was fine, and outside of her recent developments with her ED and school, we were inseparable, and on great terms. Although she is insistent on needing her space, she still responds to texts, and we've had an ongoing conversation for a few days now, although it does take a while for replies. On the whole, it feels like I am being erased.  Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this sort of situation? I want to strike a balance between giving her space, and staying in touch. Ideally, I want to be with her, but more than anything, I want to be able to communicate, and to help her in any way that I can. I have written her a few letters telling her how I feel. I try to be as supportive of her ED as possible, as well as make her feel as comfortable as I can. But whenever I do try to bring up her ED, and its relation to our current situation, she avoids it altogether.Thanks so much for reading! Any help would be greatly appreciated.",_admin_moderator,"Sat,02/27/2021-11:14am","Hi 986jj, Welcome to the forums! We are glad that you reached out for some advice and support.

I've been working on taxes, so I just got a chance to see your post. "" She broke up with me, saying that I deserved more than what she had to offer me, that she wasn't good enough, that she needed to learn how to love herself before she could love someone else. ""The ""good enough"" thing can be a big issue with people with eating disorders.  Perfectly good-hearted people, and yet somehow they just aren't good enough.  ""Worthiness""  can be another big issue.  They are simply not an adequate human being, which means that they're ""undeserving"".   Feelings like these can show up in response to…whatever - but people with EDs can commonly find themselves feeling this way, and no amount of our telling them how wonderful they are is likely to make a difference. ""She said she's not sure if she wants to be friends, and that maybe we shouldn't talk anymore - at least for a really, really long time until she feels ready.""I work on another site.  A big one for people with eating disorders. I read a post yesterday that talked about this same thing.  The person was talking about…""not wanting to have anything to do with anyone"", and there were several responses from people who felt the same way.  Like they ""couldn't deal with other people's energy"".   If that makes any sense ? To me, this means that they're feeling overwhelmed by all the of emotional things which come with an eating disorder.   The ""good enough"" thing, feelings of unworthiness ; self-hate and depression can be big issues too.  So they start withdrawing. Who knows what set this off.  As you said, people can be doing OK, and then they have a setback.  Perhaps it was some stress at school, or who knows what.  Often it's something that causes the person to begin feeling like they aren't on top of things. The control issue, you know ?It's probably fair to pay attention to what the person said in the post I read.  ""Feeling overwhelmed by other people's energy.""So…if you want to retain a connection to her, think in terms of communications which won't feel too demanding to her ?  Like you may not want to mention her eating disorder, or quiz her about how she feels about the relationship ?  Instead you might want to talk about a hike you went on, or how the weather seems to be getting warmer.  For myself, yesterday I saw the first butterfly of the year here at my house.  I saw a bluejay yanking some dried twigs off of a dead bush to start making her nest.  If you want to write to her, you might want to keep it to things like that, if you follow me ?  Messages which could be soothing, and more like little gifts, you know ?  Notes which don't ask for any energy on her part.  ""Sending best thoughts"" and like that. I'm going through the same thing myself with a web friend.  We've been writing for years, and often she'll go into detail about the issues she's having.  But when I respond to those issues, often I don't hear anything back.  So I may need to start taking my own advice, and keep things lite.  Some observations about the days getting longer and such.  The crocus that are blooming in my yard. Nothing too demanding, you know ?  And not like you are too unsettled yourself. In any case, hope you see this note, and that some of this seems to make some kind of sense.",986jj,"Tue,03/02/2021-7:31pm","Hi Bob,Thanks for the reply, I really appreciate you taking the time amidst a busy schedule to respond!Since posting, I've had some time to come to terms with what happened, and am in a much better place. Your advice and insight only served to put me further at ease. I liked what you said about energy - it actually reminded me of some things she's told me in the past. Occasionally when friends would ask her to hang out, she'd cite (to me, in confidence) how much effort it took to be ""on"" around them all the time, which seems pretty similar to the post you described. So thanks for sharing that point - it made it easier for me to imagine what she must be feeling, because I remember being around her in those situations and seeing how easily that anxiety can manifest into the desire to withdraw. I have a follow-up to your last point about retaining a connection, and keeping things light/not too demanding, if you have the time.  We haven't spoken since last Friday, and - seeing how she asked for space - I was planning on waiting until at least the end of this week/early next before reaching out again (is this too soon?). She is out of town with friends until this Friday, so on top of everything that is going on with the breakup (and possibly ED), it just doesn't seem like a great idea to disrupt what is presumably an enjoyable time for her, because if she's already having a good time with friends, the last thing she probably wants is someone (me) throwing off her energy. Since it will have been a while since we last chatted when I do eventually reach out again, would you suggest sticking with the same strategy - keeping it light, focusing on everyday events - or would you recommend addressing the fact that we haven't spoken in a while? I guess what I'm asking is: should I assume that, henceforth, we are friends who casually message each other once in a while, or should I preemptively apologize for anything I might have inadvertently said in the days following our breakup, and tell her that it all came from a place of love/care before jumping into the not-too-demanding, friendly chatting?Thanks again and take care!",BobJ48,"Thu,03/04/2021-12:44pm","Hey JJ, ""Since it will have been a while since we last chatted when I do eventually reach out again, would you suggest sticking with the same strategy - keeping it light, focusing on everyday events - or would you recommend addressing the fact that we haven't spoken in a while?""Personally, I'd keep it light.  She's already going to know that you haven't spoken in a while, and while this is a reasonable issue for us, we don't want to cause the other person to start feeling defensive.  Which would just be creating another issue, you know ?  "" I guess what I'm asking is: should I assume that, henceforth, we are friends who casually message each other once in a while, or should I preemptively apologize for anything I might have inadvertently said in the days following our breakup, and tell her that it all came from a place of love/care…""I think I see where you are coming from, and the way I see it is why should we have to apologize for being concerned about the person ?  Perhaps it made them uncomfortable, but even so, that's just the sort of person we are.  The kind of person who is concerned for our friends. Which should not be something that we should have to justify or explain.  Just my two cents about that, but it is how I feel. One other thing to keep in mind, I'm not exactly sure why you guys broke up, but it's possible that it's simply because you knew about her eating disorder.  I've read posts where that seems to be the case.  The woman spills the beans about her ED, the fellow acts concerned, then she starts to withdraw, and sometimes they break up.  Except in some cases (certainly not all ) what do you know, she's going out with some new guy right away.  Guys can be puzzled by this, but I always ask them if they think she is also telling this new guy about her ED ?  I bet not. Which, while it's OK for people to have issues which are private, if they are going to tell someone about these problems, it's one of the obligations of friendship that we should care I think.In any case, you'll often hear people with EDs regretfully talk about how ED's have ruined their relationships, so keep that part in mind too.  As caring friends/partners, when things start going sideways, we have this tendency to to think that if we'd only done things differently, or if we were doing things differently now, then somehow everything would not have gone off track.  That simply the fact that we love and care about the person isn't enough.  When in normal relationships it should be.Also, another thing to remember is that in any relationship,  only 50% of the thing is ours, and the other half, by definition, is always going to be out of our hands.  All we can hope to do is be 100% with our half.  And that even then, sometimes ""being perfect"" is still not enough. In any case, you'll have to see how she feels about keeping in touch.  The worst thing for ourselves is when we bring all of our good-will to a situation, and then the nature of the situation makes us feel like a stalker or something.Also keep in mind the fact that in good relationships, the other person is generally going to act as though they welcome our attention, which is something that we should be able to feel coming back from them.Assuming that all relationships are perfect, that is. Which…there'd be a lot fewer Country Western songs if that were the case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,01/17/2021,Adviceforsupportingmygfduringrecovery,amc0318,"My girlfriend is pretty open about her ED. Even before we started dating she had told me about it, and many of her friends had known too. She has a private account where she’ll post however she’s feeling during the day and today she posted about how she’s gaining weight in an area of her body that she feels insecure about. As someone with anxiety and depression, I’ve done the same thing simply to vent and sometimes don’t want anyone who sees it to acknowledge what I’ve posted. And at the same time, there are moments where I wish someone would reach out, but I just am unable to start that conversation one on one with anyone. I’ve always preferred talking and expressing concern or encouragement in person in comparison to over text, but if still feel the need to text her when she feels this way but I don’t want it to come off fake or not genuine. Should I respond, and if yes, how should I? I don’t want to make the situation worse, but I still want her to know I support and love her.To simplify, if my girlfriend were to post something on a private account to vent about how her ED is making her feel, should I text her about it? And if so, what should I say that can be supportive and show her how much I love her? And what should I avoid saying?",BobJ48,"Mon,01/18/2021-1:10am","AMC,A lot of people find it easier to express themselves in writing, so I understand what you mean about private accounts. So I guess what I'd ask is how private ?  Can everyone see what she's written ? Is she interested in anyone seeing it at all ? If you two get together in person, and she's OK taking about things when you do, then that's probably going to a good way to communicate.But yes, what about her writings ?  (Do you think shk'swriting them mostly for you to see ?) I have a number of people I talk with on the phone or on Instant Message or through e-mail, but who also post things relating to their mental health on Facebook or other types of forums where others can see what they wrote. .  In instances like that, I usually just leave a ""like"", simply to let them know that I've read what they have to say.  That they've ""been heard"", if you know what I mean ?   When we get together later in ways where we can talk more extensively, then perhaps we'll talk more about what was in their writings.But if they are just ""putting it out there"", so to speak, mostly I'll just acknowledge that I saw it.  If the platform they are using allows that I mean. Not sure if that answers your question, or if that's the same sort of situation you're in.  Like sometimes people just want to be heard, and not get a whole lot of feedback.   Or at least not right at that moment, you know ?",TheStormfly,"Tue,02/09/2021-8:13pm","You could send her a message saying something like ""I saw your post. I want you to know that I care about you (regardless of what you weigh) and I'm here if you ever want to talk."" You can tailor the message so it sounds like something you would say. Basically it's an invitation for her to vent if she thinks that talking would help. And if she doesn't want to talk about it, she can simply say nothing, but she will feel valued and heard either way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,01/26/2021,MyGirlfriendhasanEDandIneedhelp,anonop,"My girlfriend is suffering from an ED in which she often stops eating completely, especially when in a time of stress but it is something completely beyond her control. Only I and a couple of her friends know and telling her family or a doctor is not an option or her condition will only get worse.
My issue is that I asked her if it would affect her if I at any point decided I wanted to split up with her (which I have no current plans on doing) and she told me she would likely stop eating completely for a long time, since we both agree we are each in the happiest relationship we've ever been in and it would be a horrendous loss for her.
This, I'm aware is completely beyond her control but I can't help but feel that I cannot break up with her ever now, because I could never let that happen to her - but what if I do eventually decide I should move on?
Any advice is appreciated.
Thank you.",BobJ48,"Wed,01/27/2021-8:32pm","Hey Anon,Yes, it's a dilemma alright.  And she's probably right, her ED would get triggered should you guys break up. But as you said, there are a lot of things to consider.  Is it fair to be held hostage by a partners' ED ?  And who should be responsible for that?And what about persona loyalty ?  I have a few web friends who I just stick with, no matter what happens, because loyalty is a big issue for me.   Moreso than it has any right to be be for other people it seems. Also, in a sense a person's ED is beyond their control.  Like Depression and Bipolar and other mental heath conditions.  But on the other hand, a person is not totally helpless, because they could seek professional help for their situation, rather than being passive and feeling like they are helpless to fight it. But yes, what if you should decide to move on ?   As we know, couples break up fairly frequently.  It's sad, but it's not unusual either.  If we have been responsible about the break-up, should we feel responsible for their sadness, or whatever reactions they should have ? Or is it time for each person to look out for themselves ? You'll have to see how you feel, and see how her ED develops.  If it's a now-and-then thing that would be one thing.   But if it turns into an everyday condition, and she's not choosing to get help, then it would not be irresponsible or uncaring of you to find yourself feeling like it's a lot tome asked to  put up with. This is just me of course, but I suspect that how things proceed will hinge on whether her ED gets worse, and if she then decides to get help or not.  While a part of ourselves can long to be their rescuer, in my experience that's not our role.  Or role is to be supportive of their struggles to get better, and to support them when they start feeling down. On first glance, that may not resemble ""doing something"" as far guys tend to see things, but it can also mean more than we think.In any case, perhaps not much of an answer.  I guess what I mean is that you'll need to keep track of the situation, and then decide what you want to do as matters progress.It sounds like the two of you may have some things to go through that are still in the future, so do  keep in touch, OK ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,01/15/2021,AdviceforHelpingBoyfriendwithBED(+BipolarII),MegLeg,"Hi everyone,
I just joined this forum and haven't found any posts regarding binge eating disorder. Lately, my relationship with my (live-in) boyfriend has been a bit strained. Almost all our day-to-day responsibilities have shifted onto me over time and I need to talk to him about this because it's causing me to feel depressed most days. But I'm also really concerned about his eating habits because they've been getting worse.He's diagnosed with binge eating disorder and has insomnia (due to the bipolar disorder) and he's been sneaking more and more junk food while I'm sleeping. I get our weekly groceries (including healthy snacks he likes! and he gets input in the list) and do all the cooking for us but he works part-time at a pharmacy and brings home snacks every day he works. He also drinks energy drinks all day. Whenever I ask him what he got, he lies about what's in the bag (telling me about 1-2 of the items, leaving the others in the bag as if I can't see them) and then he justifies the purchases to me based on their price (""well I only got this because it was only $3 for 2"") kind of making it seem like he HAD to purchase it.Our days are so different it feels like we're living completely separate lives - I get up at 7:30 and clean up wrappers/plates/etc he left out the night before, take care of our pets, get ready for work. I have lunch at 12:30 or so and if it's an off-day for him, he won't get out of bed until around 3pm. I get off work at 4 and do some more house chores or errands and make us dinner (anywhere from 5:30-7:30). After dinner, I'm so exhausted and usually feeling frustrated at him (probably a little bit of jealously, too if I'm being honest) and I don't want to do anything except curl up and read. But at this point, he's ready to hang out, play video games and watch tv together. After I go to bed at 11pm, this is when he struggles with binge eating. He usually starts around 12 or 1am and sometimes has gone as long as eating continuously until 6am. Usually he finishes eating by like 3am and then he immediately goes to bed once he's done eating. We sleep in separate rooms (due to the insomnia) and I often find even more food/wrappers hidden in his bedroom. I have to write in sharpie ""for a recipe"" on anything that's off-limits at night because there have been times I had to go to the grocery store to replace something he ate at night.Lately I feel like I'm teetering back and forth between feeling like I'm being controlling and feeling like I'm being steamrolled and completely losing myself in the relationship. I almost never feel balanced between those 2 feelings. He kind of has this habit of shifting responsibility onto me. Like when he first moved in 2 yrs ago, he wanted me to find a way to lock the fridge and keep the key from him at night - which feels really unfair to me (or maybe I'm a bad caretaker?).Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How can you show you care without making it feel like a parent-child relationship? It's hard to approach the topic because he has a history of being shamed for his weight.Thanks in advance!",_admin_moderator,"Fri,01/15/2021-5:26pm","Dear MegLeg,Welcome to the forums! We are writing to inform you that we edited your post to remove specific food items and disordered eating behaviors that could be triggering for other users. You can review our community guidelines here. Thanks for your understanding and please continue to post!",BobJ48,"Fri,01/15/2021-11:26pm","I can't claim to know much about BED, so perhaps those who know more will chime in.Having said that, what do his own feelings seem to be about the situation ?  You mentioned that this has been going on for several years now, so certainly he must have some thoughts on it.And what about therapy ?  Has he been able to take that sort of risk for himself ?  Because therapy is kind of risky.  What I mean is…perhaps it might not work ?  Which is scary to think about too.Also, I think you are right in worrying about your role in all this. Not that you are doing anything wrong, but it can't all be your responsibility either.  ""Laying down the law"" is unlikely to work, but you also have a perfect right to be concerned. Which he might agree with ,yes ?",MegLeg,"Wed,01/20/2021-8:55am","Thanks for the reply, Bob!I know he's been feeling depressed and down on himself. The weight gain and loss has always bothered him. His mom has her own struggles and shames him for his weight. (She had the audacity once to tell me that I needed to get him on track with it.)We talked a little over the weekend and he said he wants to do more to help around the house and that he's mad at himself. He said he wants to go to sleep earlier and knows he can, agreed to cook dinner on his days off. He didn't bring up anything about the eating habits. Since then, he's done a couple chores around the house but the schedule/eating has been the same.He hasn't been to therapy in quite a while. I don't think he's opposed to it, but he's been a little avoidant with it. He really likes his psychiatrist though, but he only talks with him for med evaluation every 6mo or so. I've been considering contacting their office (his counselor and psychiatrist are in the same practice) and asking them to reach out to try to reschedule. I guess they're probably just busy, but it seems strange they haven't been reaching out periodically.",BobJ48,"Wed,01/20/2021-1:51pm","Yes, it does sound like he is trying to take charge of his behaviors, which is a positive thing.  Getting his sleep schedule on track, trying to take a larger role in the chores around the place - These sound like steps forward to me, and may be things that begin to help with his depression and his sense of himself.More of that might help, do you think ?   Like that he could commit to sticking with this new routine , rather than it just being sort of an experiment for the moment ?   Feeling like we are more engaged with life, in ways that are positive and productive - I'm not sure it's the total cure for depression, but it does give a person some things to feel hopeful about, when it comes to their sense of themselves as useful human beings.Catching up with therapy might help too.  I'm often of two minds about how much therapy can help, but I do believe that simply the act of committing to it can make a difference.  Like that a person is taking a positive step for themselves, you know ?  Which really does count as something I think. So yes, the idea of reconnecting with the world and it's activities  a little more ; That's always a positive thing I think.  :-)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,01/12/2021,Worriedinanldr,ayi123,"Me and my boyfriend have been in a long distance relationship for about a year and 5 months. He has always been insecure about his appearance and weight but never to the point where i’m really worrying about his well-being. During the past couple days, he’s brought it up to me about how he “doesn’t deserve anything because of how he looks”, and that he should “stop eating at all until he’s skinnier”. i’m obviously extremely worried about him and i’m not sure what to do. i want to support him but i don’t want him to develop an eating disorder as that’s really unhealthy and hard to get out of but he doesn’t realise that. i’ve done my best to support him so far and he is really adamant on doing it.. and in a ldr, it’s really hard to support him from here. i’ve told him to talk to his therapist about how he feels and what he’s thinking, and i hope he does as they can actually help him. is there anything else i can do? i’m really worried about him.",BobJ48,"Wed,01/13/2021-5:31pm","Oh brother, it's the curse of the "" good enough"" thing !!   This is a theme  that runs through all of eating disorders it seems. Connected to it are themes of self-discipline, personal accomplishment, sense-of-self, and  ""the comparing thing"", where we instinctively compare ourselves to others, as well as ""worthiness"".    All of which tend to get narrowed down to the ""good enough"" thing. You are right in asking him to talk to his therapist about all this.  On the surface it can seem to be about weight and eating, whereas it's actually about a long list of deeper issues instead. Self-acceptance, and are we a good person who's worthy of a good life ?   These really are some legitimate existential questions, and to narrow them down to some numbers on a scale is really not doing them justice. To help him…it's always been my feeling that if we can let the person know that we have an idea about the sorts of thoughts that they may be struggling with, on some of the deeper levels I mentioned, that actually can be felt as helpful by the other person.Things like eating disorders can be awfully lonely, so to know that someone else ""get's it', or at least that they are trying to…there can be some comfort in that I believe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,12/28/2020,Advice:GirlI'mDatingHasWithdrawn,stinkmystery,"Having read through the forums, I know that this withdrawal is the number 1 thing that guys bring up.  And BobJ's posts have been helpful (I'm hoping he responds to this also).Here's the background / context:
We've been dating for 5-6 months, and things were going great.  As December and the holidays came up, I started to notice that she began cancelling more and more plans with me last minute and her communications because much terser and seemingly less caring.  Very transactional (i.e., no longer telling me about her day and plans, no longer asking questions about me - - just very terse responses that may answer my question but basically end the conversation).  She mentioned to me that December is a tough month for her and that she will struggle (due to domestic abuse situation from prior relationships during this time).  I had no idea the extent to which the withdrawal would happen - days without direct communication (although she will post stories on Instagram for the world to see), cancelling of plans last minute (sometimes literally one minute before we are supposed to meet), etc.  This is now the 3rd week where this is happening.We typically meet at least once a week on the weekend...we met the weekend of the 5th twice and had a great time, then silence and cancellations for the weekend of the 12th, then we saw each other on the 17th and the 20th (she cancelled and rescheduled a few times and mentioned difficulty with ED that week, so something may have triggered her, and also that we were feeling ""relationshipy"" - - again, I know...very common per BobJ's experiences), and then she basically cancelled our Christmas plans and has let me know via txt that December is really hard for her, she knows it must be confusing for me, and to bear with her.  I told her that I would absolutely be here and continue to be, and that I'll be flexible for her based on when she wants to meet.  I may have then done a faux-pas as I then noted that I feel that this month she's been in a funk because of her struggles with the time of year and ED rearing its ugly head - - I also offered to provide her with any support or help she needs to fight ED (someone to talk to, setting up first appointments, etc.) and then I said ""pls take care of yourself, be kind to yourself, and know that I'm rooting for you in every way possible way and hope to see you sooner than later"".  I realized later that since this is over txt (it's not ideal, but how we communicate when we aren't together), all that may have been overwhelming.  I took a page out of BobJ's book and sent a text later that simply said ""I'm sorry if my actions today were overwhelming...I'm not perfect...so pls bear with me too!  I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you.  Thank you for reiterating that this month is tough and asking me to bear with you - I will!""I'm trying to balance giving her space and letting her know I'm here for her.  Since we've met, I've always sent good morning and good night texts - - I've continued to do so.  She's also consistently stated that she likes that I'm persistent in communicating with her and when I explicitly asked her if she would like me to continue texting, her answer was ""yes - as long as you're ok with me not responding all the time.""I'd appreciate thoughts on the following:
1. I've read that consistency in relationships is important for people in ED recovery.  Is my consistent texting helping or hurting?
2. When I text, should I continue to invite her to do things together and meet (even if she doesn't respond)?  Does that make the person with ED feel better knowing that they are still being thought about and included or does it create undue pressure?
3. Is the silence something she is choosing or is ED making it difficult for her to communicate?  I think it's the latter...although it's hard for me to understand why she can't take a minute to let me know what's going on - - I'm guessing it's the shame aspect of ED there too.
4. I've written a letter to her that I'm on the fence about delivering...would it be ok for me to share it here (names and things like that removed) and get opinions on whether it would help or hurt if I shared it with her?  I don't know whether I should put it in her mail or hold on to it and read it to her together.Sorry for the ramble, but I'd appreciate thoughts and sharing of experiences on how to best interact with her during this time.",BobJ48,"Mon,12/28/2020-9:07pm","Hey.  I'm glad you took the time to write.And yeah, the ""what to do"" part. When the responses we get are…""inconsistent""...it can be really hard to judge if we are doing OK  with our end of things or not.And how about the part where you can get together and have a good time, and then, like some kind of switch gets thrown, it can seem like they don't want our company at all.  So you are right; how are we supposed to know how we are doing ?This part too:  ""...days without direct communication (although she will post stories on Instagram for the world to see),""  So sometimes being really open, and other times being closed off.
 So there you are, in a situation where it seems like she's in control of the relationship, but at the same time, she'd probably tell you that she doesn't necessarily have it figured out herself.  Which means that you are probably OK with following your caring instincts, and try not to question yourself too much.What she said about December being a hard month, if people have had intense negative experiences in the past, it's not uncommon for them to become unsettled every year, around the time that those events happened.  So what she's telling you about that is not unusual.Anyhow, I'm rambling myself, so about the questions you asked :1. I've read that consistency in relationships is important for people in ED recovery. Is my consistent texting helping or hurting?I think you're right about that, and even if she seems to be ignoring you, I wouldn't feel bad about keeping it up.  Because I do believe that the consistency has meaning for her, as long as you don't act upset that she isn't replying.  She kind of told you that herself, so I think you're OK to believe it.   I mean, you like her, right ?  So somehow you're supposed act otherwise ?2. When I text, should I continue to invite her to do things together and meet (even if she doesn't respond)? Does that make the person with ED feel better knowing that they are still being thought about and included or does it create undue pressure?You know, I'm not sure how helpful it is to treat the situation with kid gloves. Granted, she may feel some pressure ,but what, you guys are just supposed to give up on the world, and let ED run everything ?  "" I know you might not feel in the mood, but I thought we might go on a hike this weekend, if you find that you feel like going.""   Remember that people with Eds can be put-off by the idea of eating, so you might say "" I know you might worry about the food angle, but I hope you won't worry about what I'll think of that.""   What I mean is, if you can convey the fact that you understand what some of her worries might be….that you ""get it""…then it might help her feel more comfortable.3. Is the silence something she is choosing or is ED making it difficult for her to communicate? I think it's the latter...although it's hard for me to understand why she can't take a minute to let me know what's going on - - I'm guessing it's the shame aspect of ED there too.I think it's that with EDs, there are periods of time where pretty much everything just feels overwhelming.  Being asked to ""be normal"" can just seem like too much.  Folks generally aren't too happy to admit that, so there may be some shame going on too.  So the person ends up just avoiding the whole thing.  But no, I don't think she's doing it to be mean, or to send some kind of message that you're just to dumb to figure out.4. I've written a letter to her that I'm on the fence about delivering...would it be ok for me to share it here (names and things like that removed) and get opinions on whether it would help or hurt if I shared it with her? Sure, let's hear it.  My guess is that you've probably done a good job, but we could check it out if you'd like. ""  I don't know whether I should put it in her mail or hold on to it and read it to her together.""Let's see what it says first.  You know how it goes I suspect; if something feels challenging in the moment, we can impulsively say things that we might not say, if we'd had more time to think about what we'd really want to say.And just to say, the fact that she's been as open with you as she has…that's kind of hopeful I think.   Not that anything about EDs is easy, but it sounds to me like she's not in denial about her situation, which can make things easier than they could otherwise be. Bob J.",stinkmystery,"Mon,12/28/2020-11:44pm","BobJ - thank you very much for your response.  First a few updates.
1. She texted me a fair bit today and noted that she had a better day today...did some exercise and is trying to make the best decisions possible to keep it a good day.  So that is promising and helps calm my mind.
2. We set a plan to meet this weekend, and also tomorrow...fingers crossed that all of that happens and she continues to have good days!
3. I've hemmed and hawed about the letter and have decided not to share it with her for now.  But I've included the contents below.  I think it serves more as a good reminder for myself about what she might be going through and how I should actually feel about the periods of silence if I'm in her shoes.  I'm sharing it below in case it helps anyone else who finds themselves in my position.  I think sharing it with her at this point might make her feel like I'm overanalyzing her...and for somebody with ED and wants control, that can be very scary and ""relationshipy"".  I will share it with her one day if she feels like she has recovered or gotten a good handle on ED.Here's the letter - I would love your thoughts on it, even though I likely won't share it with her for now.Dear <Name>,The holidays - - I understand and know that it is a really tough time for many people…and specifically for you.  I understand that you likely feel awful about withdrawing, cancelling, etc, and I forgive you - - I am assuming it is ED and/or the trauma rearing its ugly head.  And I want you to know that I’ll be patient because you’ve told me this will happen and set that expectation early as you shared your struggles with me over the past months. I want to be with you through this to help out any way I can. I’m firmly on your side – whatever you do.Here are some things that I think you may be feeling or going through:
• You may worry that you are somehow not good enough or perfect enough or have anything to offer
• You may sometimes wonder if you’ll ever get or feel better
• It must be difficult to believe good things about yourself
• You must be feeling really terrible
• Sometimes, you probably feel like you hate yourself
• I know things must feel really awful right now, and how discouraging it must be to feel like things will never be able to change and/or relapses will always occur.
• Thinking about the future is scary
• You might feel a sense of guilt about causing others to worry or feeling like a burden
• You might feel like a disappointment or that you will inevitably disappoint
• You might feel like you don’t trust yourself
• Having someone authentically care about you is scary, because of many reasons – namely expectations or obligations that you (or sometimes ED) might feel you can’t or don’t want to live up toAny of the above may or may not be true, but I imagine that you’re feeling some combination of them during this time.  I want you to know that I continue to read and learn about what you’re going through and will keep doing so.Please remember the following:
1. I know that you care about me.  And you know that I care about you.  Let’s use that as a strength and trust each other (scary – I know).
2. I’m planning to stick around.  I think you plan to also and per your text, I will be patient and bear with you.  Let’s get through the holidays!
3. I’m trying to strike the right balance between reaching out so that you know you’re valued / wanted and giving you space.  I’m not perfect and likely am not striking the right balance (I’m sorry)…Just know that whatever I do, it’s rooted in #1 - - we both care.
4. I’m here to support you - - Please let me know, when you’re ready, what would be most helpful.  I hope you take the risk to continue trusting me and take me up on my offer of support and help. I understand that sometimes it’ll be to find ways to go along with your ED / trauma or it could be helping find ways that might help you fight it and get better or it could simply be to do fun things completely unrelated to take your mind off things - - Either way, I’ll support you and trust you (note that doesn’t mean I won’t challenge your thinking)I’m around and not working this upcoming week.  So, reach out whenever you feel like you can meet and we will meet. I’d like you to receive and open your Christmas presents, hike / walk outside with me, hit the range with me, or just hang out – no need to talk about ED or anything like that unless you want to!  It’s an open invitation.  I’m on your side, be kind and forgiving to yourself, and I’ll be here <Name>!  I do want to see you and just be with you when you’re able.",BobJ48,"Tue,12/29/2020-5:21pm","SM,Regarding the letter, you wrote : ""... I think it serves more as a good reminder for myself about what she might be going through, and how I should actually feel about the periods of silence if I'm in her shoes. ""This is just what I was going to say, but you've said it yourself.  When we write things like this, we are reminding ourselves, just as much as we are speaking to the other person. And boy, it really sounds like you've been doing your homework.  The list of bullet points are right on the money, so I believe  you can have confidence in the things that you wrote.One suggestion though.  That thing you always hear about ""You"" statements. And how we should make ""I"" statements instead.   For example :
• You may worry that you are somehow not good enough or perfect enough or have anything to offer.  Instead you might say :""I know it must be difficult to worry if you'll ever be good enough, or worry if you'll have anything to offer.""Maybe it's just semantics, but using ""I"" statements gives more of the impression that you ""get it"", and hints at the fact that other ""perfectly normal"" people can worry about those same things too.  Which is kind of true, I think, for anyone who's personally reflective.  That's one of the things with EDs, I've always felt.  The emotional issues they attempt to address are not that far removed from what many thoughtful people think about.   Are we ""good enough"" yet ?   Are we deserving of a good life ?  What sorts of trials should we be expected to put ourselves through, before we are finally ""worthy"" ?  You can begin to understand  why people often say ""It's not about food."" So yes, I'd keep all the things in that letter in mind, and pull them out when each one of them seems appropriate. You guys may not be at the point where it's comfortable to talk about these things face to face, but in your texts and such, sometimes it's easier that way.Also, one other concept to keep in mind, and that's ""risk taking"".  Various things are going to feel risky to her.  Sometimes going out with you is going to feel risky. Anything that seems like it may have to do with eating can feel…unsafe.  Being around other people can feel risky.  My guess would be that she's probably reached the point where she resents the fact that her ED constricts and restrains her like this.  So keep the ""being willing to take risks"" part in mind.  Not that you need to urge her to take them, but just that you know that she's having to take them sometimes. Otherwise…well, as perhaps you've noticed, not too many guys take the step of coming here and talking about these things.  Trying to dope the situation out, I mean.  So I hope you can feel good about your efforts to do a good job.Even that can not be enough sometimes.  But to be able to say that we're trying our best - That's a thing  that help ourselves too.",stinkmystery,"Wed,12/30/2020-11:08am","Thanks very much Bob!  Thankfully, I was able to see her yesterday and we had a good time together opening presents and talking.  We also seem to be able to talk about ED in person - - it's actually much more difficult over text.  Her perspective is that talking about it is a key step to taking away power from ED, which is a great headspace to be in.  She's also told me that ""she'll always be back"" - - I hope that's true!  We now have plans this weekend again, which is really positive - hopefully as we get past December, whatever caused her to withdraw becomes less of an issue...I appreciate the ""I"" statement examples - I tried, but can clearly do better with them!  And the way you framed the ""risk"" piece is great - I'll keep that in mind!  I agree that she's reached a point where she wants to fight ED and resents it.You stated that:
""That's one of the things with EDs, I've always felt. The emotional issues they attempt to address are not that far removed from what many thoughtful people think about. Are we ""good enough"" yet ? Are we deserving of a good life ? What sorts of trials should we be expected to put ourselves through, before we are finally ""worthy"" ? You can begin to understand why people often say ""It's not about food.""""What other things do EDs often think or obsess about?  Also, when EDs withdraw or disappear for a day or two, can you help me understand what EDs are going through?  Why might they post on social media but not take the time to communicate with close loved ones?",BobJ48,"Wed,12/30/2020-8:47pm","Hey there SM,""What other things do EDs often think or obsess about?""OK, what I said about how ""It's not about food"" ?  One of the nastier aspects about eating disorders is frequently people obsess about food all day long.  In fact, often when people finally start thinking that they might be in trouble, they'll tell you that that's what did it - "" I realized that that was the only thing I was thinking about 24/7.""  Food, what food they were going to eat next, how many hours until the could eat, how  many calories, and etc.  They'll tell you how bad it can be ; Their studies go to hell, they didn't have room for friendships or hobbies anymore - they have this sudden realization that it's like their brain has been taken over by ED.Which…all this restricting and self-discipline was supposed to be about being in control, but instead now it's controlling them.  This is when a lot of people go ""Uh oh"" and can begin to have depression and such.People can have lots of trouble with self-hate too.  And the idea of not wanting to be a burden on others.  Which may be what's happening when you don't hear from her.  Like that trying to keep a happy face on…it just gets too hard sometimes. Also, she's going to be thinking ""He wants me to recover"", which to be honest, sometimes they don't feel ready to do.  So they can worry about being a disappointment to you.  The ""not being ready"" can play a role in withdrawal I think. They don't want to be put in a position where they let you down.With social media…sometimes it's anonymous.  They can say what's on their minds, and there won't be any consequences.  Whereas if their loved ones knew what they were thinking…there might be.  I work on a message board that can't be mentioned here, and people are always worrying that people they know will somehow find out who they are, and read their stuff.  I'm not sure what the context is as far as the social media that she's on, but if she knows that you are reading it, I think you can count on the fact that she want's you to know all that stuff, even if she can't tell you in person. LOL, and the ""I"" statement thing.  Yep, it can take some practice, yes ?  And feel a little unnatural to begin with.  But maybe you can see how to the other person it sounds…a little less challenging, I guess ?   Like when we say ""I"" it's like we are taking some personal ownership for the ideas ?  Rather than getting all ""You you you"" at the person. What you said about the two of you being able to talk about ED in person - That's something that's really worth being encouraged by I think. Because a lot of people can't do that.So…the ""taking risks"" thing that I mentioned, she's already doing that. Which is always a good sign I think.And I hope you guys have a good time on the weekend.  EDs can be lonely and isolating, so being able to do normal sorts of stuff and stay connected with the world, that's a legitimate area where partners can help I think.Let us know how things go if you want to.  And yeah, the December thing.  There was probably some traumatic stuff that was involved, so it's probably best to wait until she feels safe talking about that.  When I talk with people who've had trauma, for myself, it's generally enough for me to understand that ""something bad happened"" without really needing to know the details.",stinkmystery,"Sat,01/02/2021-11:00am","Thanks Bob! Can you (or others) possibly give some advice about how to have a conversation about how the last minute cancellations and changes affect me?  I'd like to have that conversation with her in a way that's as productive as possible and want to prepare for it.For example, most of our get togethers are one-on-one and I carve out a good portion of my day to be with her.  When she cancels last minute, it creates anxiety for me knowing that something is probably wrong on her end, and it also (in the moment) makes a lot of different things run through my mind (e.g., does she not want to spend time with me, did I do something wrong)?Another example: When we communicate about plans, in person she's very enthusiastic.  And on good days (when we aren't in person), she'll commit to things.  However, as our get together approaches or on bad days, when I try to confirm logistics or time, she starts uses terms like ""maybe"" or doesn't respond - - again, causing anxiety because I don't have confirmation from her that she will show up.  Sometimes I won't know until the time we are supposed to meet.  With anyone else, I would probably have a conversation about ""respect"" (respect my time, respect our interactions), but I feel like with ED, this conversation could be seen as very negative or triggering, so would appreciate some advice on how to possibly have this conversation in a productive way.From what I'm learning, this all may be somewhat common behavior for folks with ED - is it?  And what are some ways to talk about this to identify some of the root issues and talk about changing some of the behavior (e.g., cancelling earlier, communicating why they need to cancel, or even better - finding ways to still meet up in a way that might reduce their anxiety  (i.e., i'd still like to meet with them even if what we do is different and much more low key)?Or...with a loved one, is it better to just be patient, not talk about it, and let them come out of their shell on their own?  If it's this, that's so extremely hard...",BobJ48,"Sat,01/02/2021-2:21pm","Hey Sm,Boy, this is an interesting question.  By that I mean, how much are we supposed to pander to the person's ED ?  Granted its' tough for them to be plagued by the sorts of doubts and uncertainties that result in them acting this way. I'm sure your friend would RATHER NOT behave in ways that leave you in the lurch when it comes to the plans that you've made.  So I think you can count on the fact that she's not doing it one purpose, and that she might actually feel some shame when she treats you this way.  In fact, you'll often hear people with EDs bemoaning the ways in which their EDs impact their relationships.  I guess what I mean is…I doubt that she's happy about this either. Given that, to what extent should they try and challenge their feelings in situations like this ?  Do they just give in, or do they have a certain responsibility to try and fight back ?   Being able to keep your life going in day-to-day ways, I tend to think that it's something that a person needs to mindfully work at, if they aren't going to totally let ED rule their lives.So maybe it's the ""dare to take a risk"" thing again ?  ""Gosh, I don't really feel like going out ( because I feel too fat and ugly, or I may have to look at food, or I'm too filled with self-hate ) so it will be easier if I just  cancel."" Not sure what we should expect of people in situations like that, but I do think it's usually one of those situations where they are giving in to their ED and it's negivitve messages.  Whereas if they took a risk, and when out, it might turn into a pleasant situation instead ?I'd try not to lay too much guilt on her for the disrespect she's showing towards the plans that you've made yourself.  No one likes to get stood up when they've set time aside, and made plans.  She probably knows that already, so I'd try not to rub that in, as it could just serve to feed the ""I'm a terrible person"" thing that's REALLY common among people with EDs.But I think it would be OK to say "" I know you may not be feeling good about yourself"".Which is likely to be the reason she cancels.   And something that she'll ultimately need to fight back against.",stinkmystery,"Sat,01/02/2021-4:06pm","Thanks Bob.  One of the things you mentioned in an earlier post was saying things like ""I know you might worry about the food angle, but I hope you won't worry about what I'll think of that.""She asked whether instead of dinner we could do a light lunch, which was totally fine to switch up. My question is what sorts of behaviors should I model and things should I say to show that she shouldn't worry about the food angle when we are together?Is the point that I should let her know that no matter her eating choices that I won't judge her?",BobJ48,"Mon,01/04/2021-3:43am","Hey SM, "".. what sorts of behaviors should I model and things should I say to show that she shouldn't worry about the food angle when we are together? ""In my experience, folks with EDs aren't that upset by other people eating.  If you are prone to stuffing yourself, you'll obviously want to avoid that, or (as I've come to understand recently !! ) if you make a lot of chewing noises, you'll want to avoid that too.  Otherwise, I think normal eating on your part should be fine. "" Is the point that I should let her know that no matter her eating choices that I won't judge her? ""Yes, I do think that's the point, and something you may want to mention to her before you go out.  Because….some people with EDs can be hyper-sensitive to the idea that other people are watching them eat. So you may as well say that you understand that she might be self-conscious.  I had to sit directly across from a person who I instantly had suspicions about at a Thanksgiving dinner one time, and had to watch her push her food around, and then hop up and run to the bathroom as soon as dinner was done.  I knew for a fact that she would have had a fit if she knew I was watching her, so I really had to pretend that I didn't notice. Which having worked on ED boards for so many years that I don't care to mention it, was difficult for me to do.   This person was a total stranger though.  If it had been my date, I would have told her beforehand that I understood that she might have certain ""eating habits"" and that it would not put me off if she did. Otherwise, it's kind of silly to pretend that people don't eat food. While the food scenario may be uncomfortable for the person, I'm not sure how helpful it is for you or I to pretend that we are somehow frightened by eating too.

24,12/28/2020,AdvicetoSupportGirlfriendinRecovery,TheFlopster,"My girlfriend has been suffering with anorexia for about 6 years now. We have been dating for almost a year, and she told me about her ED around the 6 month mark of our relationship. When she told me, I did tons of research on what ED's are and how I as a SO can support her. It's been tough, but she has welcomed professional help and wants to get better. I encourage her and love her regardless, and I let her know that this doesnt change my feelings for her, and it actually motivates me to be even closer with her, and to support her through this in any way I can. It has only made our relationship difficult in that she's 6 hours away from me and I can't see her because of covid restrictions. And the fact that she is constantly working, fighting, and struggling to overcome something so difficult to deal with, while I'm at home crossing my fingers, praying and hoping that she does what she needs to do to overcome her ED, is so hard for me to deal with. I guess I'm just looking for any possible ways I can be exactly what she needs me to be while I'm 6 hours away and can't see her. I would also appreciate any advice for when she leaves the treatment facility and returns home. Are there things I should be doing once I start seeing her in-person on a daily basis? What is my role as the SO in her recovery? Are there any ways with coping with the feeling of uselessness of wanting to help so badly but realistically can't do anything?",BobJ48,"Tue,12/29/2020-5:53pm","Hey Flopster,I'm glad that you wrote.  This whole situation can be difficult, and having the person be far away, that doesn't do much to help our feelings either.   So here's a few things to think about: ""  When she told me, I did tons of research on what ED's are and how I as a SO can support her. ""
Good.  A lot of guys act like real knuckleheads, and never take the time or the effort to educate themselves.  So if you think this puts you ahead of the game, it's because it does. "" I encourage her and love her regardless, and I let her know that this doesnt change my feelings for her, and it actually motivates me to be even closer with her, and to support her through this in any way I can. ""I absolutely know the feeling.  But keep in mind the fact that EDs are a bitch, and while we may bring our best efforts to the table, being ""The Rescuer"" doesn't always work.  The ""Love is all you need"" cure often doesn't work either.  On top of that, we can't reasonably expect ourselves to be perfect either.   So yeah, a lot of what happens is going to be out of our hands, no matter how perfect we try and be.My sense is that…just trying to be consistent is one thing we can do.  The person loves us -that's great.  Then later they ignore us or act like they don't want anything to do with us.   It's easy to let stuff like that effect us, and effect the ways that we respond to the person.  Best if we can project ourselves as steady and consistent I think.  In the face of what can appear like I lot of inconsistency on their part. ""...the fact that she is constantly working, fighting, and struggling to overcome something so difficult to deal with, while I'm at home crossing my fingers, praying and hoping that she does what she needs to do to overcome her ED, is so hard for me to deal with.""No kidding, this stuff can really teach us what worry means !  But here's something to keep in mind.  I'm any relationship, by definition, only 50% of it is ours, and the other 50% is always going to be in the hands of the other person.  The best we can do is to try and do our best with our 50% , and try and be OK with the idea that the other 50% belongs to the other person. Which, it sounds to me like you are pretty much doing 100% with your half.  Maybe things seem chaotic with your friend, but much of that's going to be out of your hands.  It just is.  Being able to make our peace with that part, as well as making peace with our own role in the thing, those are two big parts of our task. So yeah, being able to measure yourself that you are trying your best is one way to try and keep self-doubt at bay.  I've got a person I've been talking with for….three years now, who lives on the other side of the world, and their situation is still totally the sh*ts.  If anything, their situation gets worse rather than better.  But I just try and stay steady and consistent, try to never act like I'm freaking out, and believe that the steadiness is making a difference. I still worry, but I can also feel like I'm doing my best, which helps me not feel so awful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,12/16/2020,wiferecentdiagnosis,jareddj3,"good day everyone, this will br my first post, i wish i found this forum earlier. a brief history on my situation, my wife was recently diagnosed 2 months ago (nov 2020) with anorexia by a psychiatrist. few month before this, maybe summer 2020, she started converting to a specific diet ( she eats a regular diet prior), when I asked why, she said she is limiting her caloric intake to lose weight. she has been doing indoor cycling for about 3 yrs.this year she added beach body on her exercise routine on top of her daily cycling. I notice her mood getting worst, she gets irritated easily, she is more withdrawn and depressed as well. I asked her how much is her daily caloric intake is, and she said she limits herself to X calories/daily. i asked her this because i notice that she spends her off days grocery shopping and preparing her meals all day. she weighs each and every ingredient, and makes sure that she eats <X calories/day.she states that this is the only way to she lost weight, and she finally is getting to her weight goal of X lbs. while all this is happening, i told her she might be anorexic and we should consult a psychiatrist. she agreed with me, because she said she want to prove to me that she is fine.
after a long wait, we finally got our appointment, she was diagnosed with Anorexia nervosa, anxiety disorder and depression. she was referred to a nutritionist and started on a medication.
Our nutritionist has been great, she informed her that she needs to increase her caloric intake, and stop using the exercise bike (she complied to this) the dietitian also gave her a guide for her meal plan, which she refused to follow. all this happened in the last 2 weeks, the dietitian asked me to weigh her blindly, she was able to take a peek of her weight and she freaked out. I decided to hide our scale at home so she would stop monitoring, she said she feels like she is gaining weight and will need to keep her diet. last weekend while at work, she felt lightheaded and had a hard time focusing, so she asked to go home early, she was instructed to go stop by an urgent care if she can just to be sure she is ok before going home. all her vital signs appeared normal, and they did a set of labs. we assume the results was normal since we have not heard anything from them. she decided to call insick for the next day just to rest.
monday came, and she felt normal, and we updated our dietitian on what happened in the last 2 days, and she recommended that my wife go into an inpatient rehab. my wife did not take this lightly,
she told me she would try to follow the diet  recommended as long as she doesn’t go in rehab. so yesterday, she finally ate a regular light meal, and we went grocery shoping for her meals this week. she is trying to comply and i know it is against her will and she is not happy. the nutritionist touched bases with me and i told her the progress. she said she is worried about refeeding syndrome and will
talk to my wife again. i know for a fact that my wife will never agree to go to rehab at this point, I am just lost on how to handle this at this point and I know we have a long road ahead of us. I hope someone can chime in and give their suggestions on our situation, I apologize for the long narrative",_admin_moderator,"Wed,12/16/2020-6:14pm","Dear jareddj3, welcome to the NEDA Forums!

Thanks for your understanding and please continue to post!",BobJ48,"Sat,12/19/2020-2:32am","Yeas, it sounds like things are difficult, and if it's only been two weeks since you guys have been trying to confront the recommendations from the nutritionist, you are right - You still have a lot ahead of you.People go through a bunch of different stages with their eating disorder, and it sounds like she's still in the early stages.  I mean. it was not that long ago that she thought the psychiatrist was going to say that everything was fine.  Which…a part of her may have actually believed that things were fine.  I imagine she must have had a lot of different feelings when they said that things were not fine at all.And it's true; people can think that everything's OK.  It can take them a while to realize that generally people don't spend most of their waking moments obsessively thinking about food and exercise and weighing themselves several times a day,   For some people with EDs, it can be the growing realization that that's pretty much the only thing they can think of anymore that finally makes them go. ""Uh oh, maybe I really am in trouble."""" she is trying to comply, and i know it is against her will and she is not happy. ""No, she's not going to be happy.  One thing to keep in mind : Eating Disorders are a ""mental illness"" which means that, as you said, being able to just eat and get over all of this…that's nothing that's going to come easy.  While in the beginning she may have felt that she was in control of everything - controlling all the exercise, weighing her food, and exhibiting a lot of self-discipline,  now it's kind of the other way around - This stuff is controlling her instead.  Often when people start realizing that the tables are turned, and they aren't really in control, but are being controlled by their ED instead, that's when they can get irritable and depressed. So try and keep this in mind : Everything she's going to be asked to do, it's all going to feel wrong!  Wrong!!  WRONG !!!  to her.  It's all going to feel like the total opposite of what's right.  Gaining weight and eating more - Just the idea of that is going to feel like the whole situation is out of control and totally going in the wrong direction.  Which is the eating disorder talking, you know ?So yeah, if she resists eating, it's not her just being stubborn. It's much more than that on an emotional level.  So try not to be mad at her if she finds herself having a hard time with this, or being angry at you and the world.   What it's going to take is her being willing to take some risks with all this.  Eating is going to feel wrong, but she's going to need to take some risks with it.  The same with seeing her weight go back up.  The thought of weight-gain may make her feel panicky, but she'll need to take some risks with that.In any case, it's still early, and she still may not honestly believe  she's in trouble.  She may feel that if she does  X Y or Z, then people will leave her alone and somehow she'll be able to get away without gaining weight.  You'll have to see how it goes.   These next few weeks could be tough, so be ready for that and try not to lose your patience with her.And do keep in touch ?  Sometimes it can take a few days to get a response here, but sooner or later you'll get one.Bob J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She has been diagnosed with a form of arthritis and was on biologic injections.  About a year ago she would start being sick maybe a few times a week then slowly it has gotten to the stage where she vomits after every meal, drink - even to the point where she will vomit tablets she took half hour earlier.Due to covid and a useless GP, tests had been delayed, however she has undergone lots of imagine tests - no cause has shown up yet.What concerns me is her low BMI.  She went for an MRI on tuesday and she was so dehydrated, they couldnt insert the canula into any of her arms.  She has had a bad relationship with food over the years and would fit the criteria for anorexia, certainly many years ago this was the case where a previous GP told her she was borderline anorexic.She swears that she is not making herself sick and I do believe her - the Drs must believe her too because no one has made any effort to refer her to a specialist.Is daily vomiting like this something you would see in an eating disorder?The latest help we received was some powdered drinks full of nutrients.

That's where their stomach doesn't empty, the food just sits there, and finally they vomit.Most competent doctors will know about this, and there are tests that they can do to check stomach emptying.

Otherwise, if she actually is doing it on purpose, it's seems unlikely  that she'd be letting you know that she's doing it, but then lie about it and pretend that it's beyond her control. For people with bulimia, in my experience that's generally not how it goes. So yes, it seems reasonable to keep looking for a medical explanation, even if she's had eating disordered experiences in the past.

This has made her feelings of depression even worse and there are many days where it seems like it is difficult for her to even get out of bed. Last night she spent hours in bed looking at pictures of herself from the past and repeating how she used to look so skinny. Today she mentioned she had thought she wouldn't eat today. I am getting increasingly worried about her. I have tried to say the right thing in the past by saying I will support her in everything but I know I often say the wrong thing and as a result I only make it worse for her. I am just looking for some help in finding the right language and tactics to use with her and how to show her I support her without making her feelings of depression worse, which could lead to her sliding back into her eating disorder.  Any and all help would be much appreciated.",marty2020,"Sat,10/17/2020-10:21am","I’m sorry to hear that your partner is going through this; it must be hard on both of you right now. Watching someone you care for suffering can be devastating, and I’m glad you reached out to the forums for support. It sounds like you’re a really supportive, caring partner and reaching out like this shows that you’re willing to be an advocate for her when she needs it. Being in this situation can feel puzzling because, as you said, it’s hard to find the right thing to say at times. But, for someone handing body image issues and disordered eating, there often isn’t a “right thing” to say. Conversations about eating disorders can sometimes be difficult and scary to have with people you are close to. It might be beneficial to find some resources to help you navigate that discussion. The NEDA website has useful information that outlines how to talk to a loved one about eating concerns located at https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/help/caregivers. Also, contacting the NEDA helpline can help find treatment/support options available to you; you can call 800-931-2237 or chat. Helpline phone hours are Monday-Thursday 11 am-9 pm ET, Friday 11 am-5 pm ET. Helpline chat hours are Monday- Thursday 9 am-9 pm ET, Friday 9 am-5 pm ET.

A strong support system is essential to recovery and it seems that your partner has a good foundation with you by her side; please take care.",Annet,"Wed,10/28/2020-11:07pm","It is great that you support your partner so much. Congratulations!
Talking to someone who has an ED is not an easy thing and less when her job is so much linked to her physical appeareance. However, maybe u can remind her that her job is ""acting"", not ""modeling swim suits"". An actor is judged by her/his performance at stage. In all movies, musicals, theater performances there are characters that come in all shapes and sizes. And also pretty famous actresses have not had the ""perfect body"" or have been ""fitness models"".Help her trust on her ability to perform on stage. She is beautiful the way she is.
Being thin but unhealthy would not allow her to get the roles she wants, either. Nobody would want to hire an ""emaciated"" actor or someone who is fainting often at the stage...Tell her she can get all the roles she wants by having a healthy life style. Extremes will not make her ""happy"" or will give her more jobs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the past month or so I havent been working , I lost my job due to COVID. Well I start my new job and will be gone for 8 hours a day. My fiance is currently unemployed and is home all day, and with his ED I know he usually doesn't eat when I'm not home to remind him. Im super anxious and worried about him being alone all day, and him not eating during the day while I'm gone. Currently he only eats X cals a day while I'm there and im super stressed about him eating less then that when I'm gone. Hes aware of my concerns and we have talked about it. Im still just anxious about it and would like to know more ways I can help him eat without being overbearing while I'm at work. He already said we could video call so I can make sure he eats when I'm on lunch and I already told him ill order him food when we can.

30,09/15/2020,WillyoustilllovemeifIputonweight,alyki8,"Hi everyone, I've posted in this forum before, but just to re-hash, I am a senior in high school with a girlfriend suffering from anorexia. She was diagnosed officially about 3/4 months ago and is seeing a psychologist weekly and regularly visiting a doctor to keep tabs on her progress. She has successfully put on a bit of weight but I know is still finding things very challenging, especially in conjunction with all of our school stress (there is about 6 weeks until our final exams which will determine whether or not we get into university). Hearing some of your stories is so inspiring - especially hearing about people who have been supporting their partners through EDs for years, if not decades. I almost feel selfish sharing this, but I am beginning to find it quite challenging to support my girlfriend.The emotional labour that I need to put into our relationship is starting to take a bit of a toll. I am always really, really tired, I will get sudden bouts of sadness and anxiety for no real reason and when she lashes out at me (when having a bad mental health day) I feel really guilty, quite awful about myself and feel like I can't do anything right. The impact of all this is that I am finding it increasingly challenging to focus on school work and I am feeling really unmotivated. I know that this is all being impacted by Covid-19 as well, but I feel like I can definitely attribute some of it to our interactions. I'd say our communication is pretty good - we speak on the phone at least every second day and we always try to talk about issues that we are having, how we are feeling or anything like that. For further context, the city in which I live is in total lockdown - we are unable to leave our houses for more than one hour a day and even, we can only do so whilst wearing a mask and go out for exercise. I am able to see my girlfriend face to face around once every two weeks (under a rule that allows 'intimate partners' to visit each other) and I am currently completing school work on an online platform. This has been the case for around 3 months. More broadly, the mental health impact has been really awful, around 1000 people have commit suicide during this period because it is so difficult not being able to socialise/go to work/go to school.  The combined effect of these two factors (my girlfriend and my social isolation) is having a pretty bad impact on my mental health overall. I'm not really sure what to do because I obviously want to continue supporting my girlfriend in whatever way I can, but when she says things like 'will you still love me if I put on weight?', 'I have no friends except for you' or 'I'm not good enough/won't achieve anything in life/I'm dragging you down' I just get so upset and so anxious, which in turn puts a strain on our relationship. I can't distance myself from her because a) she will notice b) I don't want to and c) communication is so important given that we can't see each other face to face because of covid. I'm just at a bit of a loss as to what to do. I feel so tired all the time, but I really want to make our relationship work, but not at the jeopardy of my school work or my own mental health. Does anyone have any effective coping mechanisms for a situation like this?",_admin_moderator,"Tue,09/15/2020-3:51pm","We are sorry to hear you are struggling and wanted to make sure you had some resources.

32,09/02/2020,UpDate,sayia_valentine,"Hi guys! I just wanted to post an update on what's been going on.
My first post was about my fiance and his Twitter. We talked and I agreed to let him keep it so he can vent all of his thoughts out so he doesn't self harm. As of right now he he still taking laxatives and eating low calories. However from what he's told me is he's eaten more then he has in months. So that's good.
However, even though I had never been diagnosed with  an ED myself, it did trigger some of my own issues but im working on those. I guess my next thing is, how do i stay supportive and positive for him? I do get worried when I see him using fast apps and calorie counters. Also are there other support groups? I've looked on FB but can't find any for partners and I just feel as if I'm alone. Thanks",_admin_moderator,"Fri,09/04/2020-11:54am","Hi!

That really is progress I think.  As you said, it can be unsettling to see him still counting calories and using laxatives. It's a lot to ask of him to just totally stop these behaviors right away, but at the same time, it would be good to be able to believe that he is trying to fight the more unhealthy aspects of his situation.  But If he can continue to be honest with you, that's still progress I think.  As far as being supportive of him, perhaps you could ask him what he thinks might help ?  Sometimes people forget to ask that, so you might want to ask him, and see what he has to say. If anything, it would give him something to think about.I don't know if there are any more active support sites than this one.  In the old days there used to be a pretty big one, but this is the only one that I know abut now, and it's kind of hidden away on the site, and hard for people to find.

As of right now he says he's been doing alot better, and as we as told me what I have been doing has been helping him. We both have been super honest and open, and our relationship hasn't been this good in months, which is super nice. He even admitted to me that he didn't plan on going below X lbs. This is a huge improvement because before hand he wanted to be lower. Currently we have a deal that if he does fall below X lbs I will have to intervene a little more and will monitor him more. As much as I hate it, I think when he saw me struggle he realized what he was doing was toxic and he realized that he didn't want anyone he loved suffering as well. I think it helped him see what he was doing is hurtful. I'm still searching for more groups, because I do think their should be espeically for partners.

34,03/09/2020,"TwoEDs,OneRelationship",stuckonafeeling22,"My partner and I both experience disordered eating. At this point, I am farther along in my recovery journey, but I can't seem to shake the feeling that the disgust she feels at ""fat"" on her own body must be disgust that she feels towards my body as well. This is compounded by our differences in race/ethnicity that already make me the conventionally less desirable partner. I feel so guilty because it makes me feel like I'm making her ED all about me, but it's really triggering for me to hear her talk about her body in the ways that she does. I go to therapy, which is definitely helpful in working on my own stuff, but I'm really struggling to believe it when she says that she's attracted to me or likes my body in some way.Does anyone have any experience with disordered eating and being in a relationship with someone else experiencing disordered eating? How do you resolve it when your individual experiences create conflict between the two of you or internally?",BobJ48,"Wed,03/11/2020-2:12pm","Hey there,I'm not in your situation, but I know how it can be with doubts and the comparing thing.  Like how we can seem to avoid emotional feelings that are based on various sorts of physical comparisons.  And how our feelings probably *should* be based on assessments that are deeper than just surface things like that.  Which of course they should be, but you know how it goes I'm sure - various physical things can take on all sorts of emotional symbolism, and our minds get kind of stuck with that. I suspect your partner is stuck in the same symbolic mindset too, and that's part of why the ways in which she discusses her own body remain so triggering.   Because with recovery, part of the task is that people are trying to escape that. I'm not sure how you resolve this with your partner.  But if she can come to understand the dynamic that's involved, perhaps she can mindfully try and avoid that body-based sort of talk, and see if she can talk about the emotions and feelings those statements represent instead ?",sayia_valentine,"Thu,09/03/2020-2:43pm",hey!!

35,08/04/2020,Whenthingsgetbad?,benberk27,"I'm in a bit of a moral pickle and looking for some advice.My GF struggles with bulimia. We've been on and off for almost 4 years now. On the most recent stretch things got bad. She took on a new job with a ton of stress. ED got much worse, and she started saying things she's never said before. She was having suicidal thoughts, heart issues, was very scared, and had reached a point where she openly admitted she couldn't fight ED on her own.This was pretty scary, but I tried not to overreact. I tried to sit down with her and talk about options for recovery, but she got mad saying she just needed support not a 'list'. I tried to take a more active role, out of fear, but that just made it worse.Most recently she pushed away saying she needed to do it herself because it's the only way she knows how. I'm used to this by now, and I understand where she's coming from and support her in recovery, whatever that looks like.But I'm scared. In the 4 years I've known her I've never seen her this bad. She has never mentioned suicide, ever. What can or should I do?I sent her a text asking how I could support her? She never responded. I understand that could be an impossible question given what she's going through. Thank you.",BobJ48,"Wed,08/05/2020-2:50pm","Dear Benberk,Yes, it sounds like you pretty much know the drill by now, and are familiar with the sorts of limitations on what a partner can do. Sometimes I think it makes it even worse in situations like that, than it was in the beginning when we understood less. The suicide thing - those really are thoughts that can come up, that's for sure. I tend to think they relate to the control issue. In the beginning EDs served to provide the person with a feeling of control.  But later they transform themselves into a thing that controls the person instead. The old associations with control still remain, but now drive them to engage in behaviors that feel totally beyond their control. The irony of that can drive a person to despair, and cause them to feel like there's no way out.   Add that to the fact that these relapses generally show up in response to situations that are extra stressful to begin with, and things really can start getting emotionally chaotic for the person. So yeah, what now ?This is going to sound harsh, but she's going to have to man-up and take some responsibility in all this.  I suspect that she knows this already, but may also feel like there are limits on what she is willing to do to get better.  Get some therapy ?  Gosh, that's even more of the ""surrendering control"" thing. Best to really bear down on herself instead, and see if she can exert…control.  Maybe you are starting to see a theme here ?  ""I sent her a text asking how I could support her? She never responded.""Yeah, well she needs to.  She may be in a place where accepting help from you may feel (again) like she is surrendering control, but she's going to need to get past that.  Rather than just going with her knee-jerk response, she'll need calm down and think of some ways that you can help. ""Oh, no one can help me !"" may be how she's feeling right now, but in a practical sense that's probably not true. So I would not let her off the hook with that. From a broader standpoint, recovery from EDs generally means being willing to take some risks.  A willingness to get outside help; something which on it's surface may seem to fly in the face of the personal control thing. I know things must be rough now, but keep the ""willingness to take risks"" thing in mind. It may not be something that feels safe to confront her with right now, but at the same time, she probably knows that at some point it may come down to that.Anyhow, just some thoughts.   Keep writing ?Bob J.",benberk27,"Wed,08/05/2020-10:17pm","She eventually responded and said she honestly didn't know how anyone could help her, and she felt like the help she needs only she can provide herself... which is good I guess? Maybe she's taking action?What was really strange this time around is I felt like I couldn't make progress with her. If I sat back and listened and tried to support I was being too passive. If I presented her with a list of alternative options for help, she didn't want a list of options she just wanted support. At one point she even felt that me suggesting other options meant I didn't feel she was doing anything, which is not at all what I said. If I gave her affirmation I was ""cheer leading"". If I suggested therapy I was ""passing her on to a 3rd party"". It's like anytime I tried to help in the various ways I know how she pivoted and it was never enough. Is this normal?

Maybe she's taking action?""It's probably wrong for me to second guess this, but if we go with the ""EDs are about control"" assumption, then you can see where she might not want to accept help from others, and feel like she needs to handle the situation herself.  But when someone is trying to use the same brain that's getting them in trouble, to get themselves out of that same kind of trouble, it can be a difficult matter for them. As I'm sure it's being for her.  Which can result in her feeling a lot of frustration. Sort of like you are seeing reflected in the ways she responds when you try to help her.  Because they sound like the responses of a frustrated person, you know ?""It's like anytime I tried to help in the various ways I know how, she pivoted and it was never enough. Is this normal?""I guess you'll need to ask yourself what she feels might be helpful ?  Or better yet, ask her what she thinks might feel helpful to her?In my experience people with EDs don't want a list of solutions; they'd rather feel like people understand what they are going through instead. Like right now she must be feeling a lot of frustration.  So…""I know this must all feel pretty frustrating"" is the sort of thing you might say?   It's likely she has doubts about if she can recover,  so….""I know you must worry about if you can recover or not"" might be another thing you could say.Granted, statements like these may not seem like they're loaded with positivity, but the fact that they show her that someone else ""gets it"" about what she is going through…a lot of time that's what's going to feel supportive.

But as you said, you are trying to be supportive, which is hardly qualifies as a sin, so I hope you won't find yourself sucking a bunch of blame, or trying to second guess yourself.  ED will try and push her around, and will try and push you around too. So if it were me, and I was trying to keep in touch with her, I'd just talk about day to day things.  Maybe a hike you took, a nice sunset you saw, about how you'd watched the moon become full, things like that.  Things that show that you are thinking of her, but which don't try and poke ED in the eye.   I have a friend who I talk to in Norway, who is the worst self-injury person I know.  She's almost died from loss of blood several times and etc.  I'll send her some pictures of some moths that I saw, and talk about some flowers I'm growing. Sometimes I'll agree with her that the self-injury must be getting in the way of her life, but otherwise I avoid getting upset about it, and stay with the idea of our friendship. So basically I stay in touch in ways that show that I think she is someone worth knowing (which she is) but the issues she is having are not the main topic of our conversations. Unless she brings it up herself, that is, and even then I'll mostly stick with the day-to-day parts of life that I think that she might find enjoyable. This sort of approach, where we don't spend a lot of time challenging ED,  can help people stay connected to the world, rather than having their minds taken up 100% of the time by their issues. The person has to allow us to do that of course, but if it seems like she might accept communication like that, it's something that's worth giving a try.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,08/05/2020-7:43pm","Hi!

36,08/30/2020,ARFID,kimmcmc,I'm reaching out to any other parents who may be dealing with an ARFID issue. I've just heard of this within the last month as we finally got a diagnosis from a GI doc as something besides IBS. Just want to become more educated with others knowledge and experience of this confounding disorder. He is vegan and now down to less than 10 foods he will regularly consume. Many thanks.,BobJ48,"Mon,08/31/2020-11:15am","Not a parent, but I interact a lot with people who have eating disorders, and my sense is that like a lot of eating disorders, it's a safety and control issue for the person.And that that's the part that ""makes sense"" to the person who struggles with it, even when another part of them understands how much it restricts and constrains them. Being a vegan can sometimes be a part of the ""safety"" thing too I think.  In that the person would feel anxious and unsafe if they were to stray away from their ""safe foods"".  What sort of terrible thing would happen to the person if they somehow relaxed their strick self-control…I'm not sure that they have thought it out that far.  But it's clear to them that it wouldn't be good.  Again, perhaps it's the issue of control itself that sits at the heart of the thing. And who feels comfortable with the idea that their life could be somehow slipping out of their control ?No one that I know.  So it can be a real dilemma, that's for sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,08/21/2020,TheStruggleIsReal-GFhasbulimiaandfoundoutlastnight,chuckdiesel,"Hard to say where to begin or even what to write. This has been a struggle and it hasn't even been a full 24 hours. Sorry for the length of the post, its just that I don't know of anyone that has gone through this, and I learned about this forum from calling the hotline. Earlier this week I went to bed and woke up to find my girlfriend of two years standing by the coat closet digging through her purse in the middle of the night. I thought it was odd and questioned what she was doing and she responded that she was checking the front door to make sure it was locked. She was inebriated, and we have a smart lock that notifies you when the lock has changed from locked to unlocked. I didn't receive a notification, thought it was odd, and went to sleep. When I woke up, I couldn't get rid of that nagging feeling that something wasn't right. That my gut was telling me that something was off. I went to her purse and found laxatives. This isn't the first time that I had found it, and even though I'm a nurse, I did not realize about laxative abuse in bulimics. Fast forward three days, and every morning, I woke up, counted the pills, and realizing that she was taking them after I went to bed or during work the next day. I suspect this has been occurring for YEARS, we went to Disney right before it shut down in March, and I found an empty pill sheet inside an item that we used then. I have no idea how long this has been going on. Last night, I told her that I knew of the laxative abuse, that I was concerned for her health, and listed the symptoms or behaviors that I was concerned about. She always goes to the bathroom after dinner and I have brought this up several times during our 2 years together. She gaslighted me, making me think that I am delusional and crazy. I stood my ground last night, even when asking about the laxatives she lied and told me its a once in a blue moon type of thing. When I told her that I knew it was going on for several days this week, that is when I encountered the full shut down. She only admitted a problem when I said that I hope I was wrong about my beliefs/concerns.Since last night she will barely talk to me and won't look at me. We live together (a house that I purchased) and she will not be in the same room as me. It is incredibly sad. I don't know what to do right now. Not to detract too much, but my last relationship ended when I found my girlfriend cheating on me with my boss. Needless to say that I no longer work at that company, but that trust is a huge foundation of which I value in relationships, and I have had that conversation with my current girlfriend.She won't talk to me about normal things: work, the dog, how her day went - nothing. She gives short, terse answers, and says that she needs time, which I am willing to give. She wants an open ended, no goal date for this moratorium and I would not budge on that boundary, which I feel like is important. She, as far as I know, is not interested in therapy or talking to anyone, and has told me that I am the only person to know (which I take with a grain of salt). She says that she will never forgive me if I tell anyone about this without her permission, and I told her that I will not live without a support structure of my own and I will not make that promise. That I have no idea what I am talking about. It seems to me that she is trying to wrest the control of her secret back, now that it has been exposed. I don't know if her family is a trigger or not, and they are halfway across the country. Nor do I know if they know.I feel stupid for not questioning this sooner, I am a nurse. I asked questions about the little things that didn't add up, but I never put two and two together for the bigger picture. The chapped lips (allergies/climate change from move), the sores/bruising on the back of her hands (manual labor), the constant going to the bathroom after dinner (IBS), constantly being cold (just normal). I saw another post on here that said poor wound healing is a major concern and that is something that is occurring right now. She constantly gets nicks and scraps on her shins and ankles, picks at them, and they will not heal. She is supposed to go for an OB/GYN visit next week and does not have a PCP. As far as I know she has never had blood work done. Part of me is writing so I can get this all out there and take a deep breath. I am incredibly grateful for anyone that reads it, let alone offers anything in return. I understand that this is the beginning of a journey and I do not know how long it will go for or where it will take me. I will be learning as much as possible, and have immense respect for anyone that is going through this or worse.",Tryingtoheal,"Sat,08/22/2020-11:15am",I think your gf might be feeling exposed and might be terrified of other people find out.  Maybe she isn't ready for help yet.  I'm not sure what the best course of action would be.  I'm sorry about you being cheated on.  Have you thought about talking to a therapist yourself?,chuckdiesel,"Sat,08/22/2020-8:04pm","Sure have, and it did wonders for the previous relationship. I'm looking to go back and discuss this with my therapist as I stopped going cause things were better. We've had some progress today, she's at least talking and wanting to be with me. Though she is ""triggered"" (or at least that's what I think) if she sees me looking up articles or reading about ED. This isn't something that I'm going to sweep under the rug, and I won't force it on her either. Trying to do my part to be prepared and learn to support.",Tryingtoheal,"Sat,08/22/2020-10:50pm","I think she'll slowly start opening up,  but it could be a while.  Perhaps she's shocked she has been found out, and those secrets are huge fears.  Sometimes those suffering feel bad they're hurting the ones they love and don't know how to explain it.  Sufferers don't want others to know or worry about them.  I suffered for 30 years, so I can have an idea of her thoughts.   Keep me posted on what happens.   It's a really great thing for you to get the support you'll need.   My husband just being there and going through intense treatment (inpatient at the hospital a few times,residential a few times, partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient at a day program a few times, and then outpatient once a week a few times) and not feeling pressured to have to eat as well as therapy and my faith have really helped me recover.  I hope that helps to hear.  I wish you the best.",BobJ48,"Sun,08/23/2020-2:54am","Oh boy, what a situation huh ?  For her, and for you both, it sounds like. For her, it was her secret thing, and now she's busted. When it's your secret, you can put off coming to terms with things  But now that someone else knows…you saw how unsettled she was, and how unsettled she'll probably be for a while.People who do laxatives generally know its' a bad thing, and which that they weren't hooked on them. With the bulimia they can want to keep doing it, but it's not uncommon that they feel shame. about it.The general feeling among the ED tribe is that boyfriends will find out sooner or later, so she knows she should not feel angry at your. But yeah, she didn't expect all this to happen so abruptly, so she may not know what to do next, because sheproably can't just turn it off. Keep in touch, OK.

I think she is definitely coming to terms with the fact that now someone knows. I found out, little by little that this has been an on going thing for a fairly long time, and her best friend introduced it to her (her best friend was anorexic). She's trying to go cold turkey right now and be really strong about it, but I can see that it is getting to her. She's having a lot of anxiety and wants to eat but is afraid of the binge and the purge that must closely follow. I keep telling her that I'm here for her, no judging, no shame, just love and support. I'm hoping we can get in touch with some therapists tomorrow, she did do some searching on her own and found some, so it is a step in the right direction.

It's good you are there for her.  It makes a world of difference.   Keep us posted.,BobJ48,"Mon,08/24/2020-10:19am","Chuck,The fact that she seems open to therapy is a really good sign.  Lots of people are terrified at the idea, and don't want to have anything to do with the idea of giving up their behaviors, so the idea that she seems to be beyond that stage is worth being cautiously encouraged by.From a practical standpoint, she may have difficulties going cold turkey with the laxatives - people's systems can develop a dependency on them, so if she has issues in the regard, try not to be too discouraged, as it would not be unusual if she finds herself having problems going off of them. As you may be finding from your reading, all this stuff can be psychologically tangled up with the issue of ""being in control"".  And who of us feels comfortable with the idea of not being in control ?  No one that I know of.  So it can be really unsettling for the person if they don't have their old behaviors to turn to when they feel stressed about things.  Which…the idea of having to recover is going to feel stressful. Perhaps you see what I'm getting at. People with EDs are accustomed to being instinctively strict and self-judgmental about their eating habits, and so one of the changes that may be difficult for her is giving herself permission to be gentle and self-forgiving with herself when she does eat, as well as when she has some slip-ups.Which are likely to happen. Learning to deal with them while trying to keep the old forms of self-condemnation at bay, is a big part of recovery too.",chuckdiesel,"Wed,08/26/2020-3:24pm","Makes sense BobJ. I'm having some trouble (and working to get in with my therapist) over her words vs actions. While she says she wants help and I've provided some resources for her to look at when she wants to, there is no action. She was supposed to go to the OB/GYN tomorrow for an annual, her period just started, and the appointment has to be pushed back several months. This is an atypical cycle (I know that can be a side effect of the disease), it just feels too convenient. How do I approach the truth vs the old habits where she lied/gaslight about things that she didn't want to do? There also seems to be an uptick in not eating at all and wanting to exercise, which now has me worried over the reverse of what was happening. At least before there was some caloric intake where as now there is little to none.",BobJ48,"Wed,08/26/2020-5:09pm","""There also seems to be an uptick in not eating at all and wanting to exercise, which now has me worried over the reverse of what was happening. At least before there was some caloric intake where as now there is little to none. ""Yes, and this is not surprising.  EDs are a way for people to cope with stress, and now that someone else knows, and she understands that she may have to do something about her situation…now there's this new and threatening source of stress.   Plus, as perhaps you've read, EDs are also about control.  And when things seem like they may be slipping out of her control, then it's not uncommon to see behaviors ramp up then as well.  So yeah, if it seems like her behaviors are increasing, it's probably not your imagination.Plus when the subject of getting help comes up, there's this whole big thing about ""I'm not sick enough to deserve help yet.""  This is a *really* common thought too.  So sometimes people will purposely ""get worse"" so that they can finally feel that they are worthy of getting kl help.  This may not be what's going on with her now - that part often comes once they've realized that they have a problem.  What you are seeing now may be primarily a stress reaction, and from her ED feeling threatened. Is she doing this stuff just to be difficult ?  It would be wrong to believe that I think.  In the beginning EDs are about exerting control, but as time passes things get to the point where it's the ED that's in control instead.  It can take people a while to realize that, but once they do, it can be the beginning of a new stage in their eating disorder.  The contradictory nature of the whole thing can cause the person to feel depressed, and often desperate.   Which, if EDs are about control, their symptoms can often get worse then too.   So it can turn into one of those ""snake eating it's own tail"" sorts of paradoxical things, where what they do to try and feel batter is the same thing that was making them feel worse.""How do I approach the truth vs the old habits where she lied/gaslight about things that she didn't want to do? ""On the message boards woman often talk about this.  About how they would lie to their partners in order to try and hide their ED.  The general consensus among ""the tribe"" is that this is something that you aren't going to be wanting to do for any sort of prolonged period of time, and that sooner or later it's best to come clean about what your situation is.  Because what : lying to someone who cares about you is what that person deserves, simply for caring ?   Most people come to the conclusion that that's unfair to their partner,  and is just playing into the hands of their ED. So my guess is that you're going to be seeing some changes - ones which may involve a certain amount of emotional chaos and distress, as she tries to make sense of her situation.  The urge is always going to be to keep doing exactly what she's doing though, because it's her way of coping with stress and disorder.  So you may continue to see more of that.But yes, what she decides to do with these new realizations….you may need to be patient with her as she tries to work that part out.And moves on to the next stage, which is being able to say, ""Yes, I do have a problem"".  She still may have a ways to go before she gets there, but sooner or later folks usually do.  But again, you may need to be patient.",,,,,,
38,08/25/2020,HowcanIhelpmygirlfriend?,GigantNeo,"I started dating my girlfriend about 4 months ago. She was then on some kind of extreme low calorie training program (which by the way costs a fortune and seems to be a huge scam). She was pretty thin but not to an extreme extent. Then, after a few weeks, the program ended and she started to eat normally again.She told me that another guy she dated before me was trying to feed her chocolate so that she wouldn't become too ""beautiful"" by this program. In this way, by keeping her ""unattractive"", he would not become ""threatened"". So she dumped him, because she doesn't like being controlled. When she told me about this, I said ""That is such a weird thing to do. And actually, I think that you are more beautiful now than when you did that program."" This made her mad, she went home to the scale and told me she had only gained X pounds since the program. She also told me that I called her ""fat"". I tried to tell her that it was meant as a compliment and that I never would have called her fat, because she has never been that. But she was difficult to reason with. I have now started to believe that her interpretation of what that guy did is incorrect.She is pretty selective with food. She loves some national cuisines for example, while she is disgusted by other cuisines. The food that she can eat contains plenty of nutrients though, so the selectivity is not a problem in itself.Once she mentioned that she didn't have a period during this program due to the excessive weight loss.She is pretty thin and she talks about doing the ""continuation program"" which is a shorter version of the aforementioned extreme low calorie training program. When she mentioned it the first time, I said: ""Okay, sounds fun! So what's your purpose with this program?"" Then she got all mad and said that I am so locked within one perspective. I got a bit irritated so I said: ""Why do you get so mad? I only asked an innocent question.""I am starting to believe that she has an eating disorder. I don't know if she has any idea. I think that when I gave her the ""compliment"" and when I asked about the purpose of the program, I ""triggered"" the eating disorder. I have now realized that I must never bring up anything that has to do with bodyweight at all. I think it's absolutely crazy that she, already being a bit underweight, should fast for rapid weight loss. I can't see any rational reason for this.I wonder if you have any advice for me on how to help her. I don't want her to harm herself with excessive weight loss. I also want her to know that I care about her.Thank you so much for any piece of advice.",BobJ48,"Tue,08/25/2020-8:39pm","While no one can diagnose a person from a distance, yes, it sounds like she has an issue alright.  Because really, people can get wrapped up in all sorts of things : excessive exercise, ""eating healthy', and various types of diets.  But if the main thrust of the thing continues to be weight-loss, when they are at a reasonable weight already, and they get super-senstive when you say something about it….then yeah, that's kind of a sign, I think.Because really, lots of people can joke, and be light-hearted about their attempts to lose weight, but this doesn't sound like the case with her at all.   It's more like it's deadly serious, you know ?Plus, would she be able to ""eat normally' for several days, without suffering terrific anxiety ?  Most people would be able to to do that, but not people with ""eating issues"".  They would probably start feeling a lot of anxiety fairly quickly. But yes, what to do when the person still thinks that everything is fine ?  Because you are right, people can fall into these habits without really realizing the sorts of trouble that they are getting themselves into.   Until they try and stop, that is.  Or when they start having issues in their relationships that surround the matter.  That can get their attention as well.It would seem reasonable to confront her, but I think you've seen how well that has worked out.  And how even an innocent comment was met with irritation and anger..  So it can be a dilemma for sure. Basically things have to reach a point where the person  is able to admit to themselves that…they aren't as in control of the situation as they thought that they were.  Which as long as the pounds are still falling off, can be a hard thing for them to admit to. Because everyone in our society admire weight-loss, yes ?For a lot of folks, it's when they realize that thinking about food and exercise is filling their heads, to the point where they hardly can think of anything else through the day…that can be when they begin to realize that they're in trouble.  So yes, as long as she is continuing to tell herself that everything's fine, I'm not sure how you can convince her otherwise.Like it's a conclusion she'll have to come to herself, you know ?Anyhow, just some thoughts.  Which probably weren't too helpful I'm afraid.   But I think you are right in being concerned, so it doesn't hurt to keep an eye out, and hope that she doesn't end up pushing you away.  Which can be a really common thing in situations like this. It's clear that you care though, so have faith in that.  And do keep in touch, OK ?",GigantNeo,"Wed,08/26/2020-6:04am","Thank you very much for your answer. It is very good for me.I would say she is able to eat normally for several days and more but I don't know if it causes her to suffer anxiety.

39,08/13/2020,Idon'tknowwhattodo,BF359,my girlfriend and I began dating just a few months ago but I have known her longer than that. I know that she has struggled with her eating disorder in the past but she was doing better. She's reverting back to her old habits because she wants to look better for me despite constant reassurance that she looks amazing. I read that she may be doing this as a way to regain a sense of control during a hectic time. I haven't been the best boyfriend lately but I would never break up with her. It's hard for me to help her because we're young and I have no idea what I am doing. Not to mention I am also doing this alone because her family doesn't really care and my family doesn't even know that she is my girlfriend. I just want to  help but I'm scared.,BobJ48,"Fri,08/14/2020-6:12pm","Oh brother, I can see why you might be concerned.  And you are right, it's quite possible that something in her life is triggering her and causing her to feel insecure, and causing her to return to behaviors which help her feel more in control.   Not necessarily in control of whatever the actual stressors are, but a feeling of control over…just something, you know ?You mentioned being young and not knowing what you are doing.  But really, most people, no matter what their age is, have that feeling of not knowing what they are doing in situations like this.  So please don't feel like you are being dumb or anything like that.  Because it's clear to me that your heart is in the right place with all this, and while it might be wrong to think that that's going to fix things, it serves to keep aa person at least somewhat on the right path I think. One suggestion I could make would to not keep telling her that she looks great.  People's EDs tend to twist comments like that in all sorts unhelpful directions.  Like when you tell her that she looks amazing, that must mean that you DIDN'T think that she looked amazing before !  Or that you are ""just saying that"" because to be honest,  you don't think she looks good enough yet. Appearance comments are generally a no-win situation it seems, no matter how sincere or well-intentioned we are.Asking how she is feeling can help though, if she can feel safe being open with you I mean.  If she is willing to tell you things, and it turns out to be negative things that you'd rather not have her feel…try to resist contradicting her and telling her that those thoughts are silly. More helpful would be something like ; ""It must be terrible to find yourself feeling that way.""Things that show that you ""get it"" about how she's feeling, even if those feelings should seem unreasonable to us.  If you do want to point out things that are good about her, try and be specific.  Rather than saying ""You are such a good person"" (too general of a statement), you could point out how you've seen her be helpful to friends, or how you've heard her be concerned about the treatment of animals, or concerned about other situations in the world.  People with EDs can worry that they are not good enough as a person, so try and be specific, you know ?Anyhow, you sound like a good person yourself, so keep writing if it seems to help.",vlostwalt,"Wed,08/19/2020-1:51am","BF359 My mother tried to make me wise to her feeling of my then girlfriend's body image. But I had dated enough women; and this little Italian sprite and I got along. It was the end of the 80's but the fitness rage was still raging. We married bought a house had a couple kids. About the time the youngest was 6 and I was blind to things because of parenting and providing and career; my bother in law said something about how bad my lady looked at a reunion party. (we live 300 miles away from family so sometimes 6 months can go by without contact). She was freaked out be her bother in laws candid comment, her father and nurse sister chimed in. Her doctor perscribed a certain drink for a couple weeks. It was weird seeing her struggling to drink the persciption. Anyway time moved along... scare over. This is where I may need to use language that the site sometimes flags and it makes me nuts because I am just sharing the truth. Past 4 or so years she has become OBSESSED with exercise. But she wears long sleeves to Hawaii, won't eat wonderful stuff on vacation. She's so cautious about what she eats. I find out a year ago that she went nearly X DAYS on that vacation without a ""BM"". Shesh, no wonder she couldn't eat, but also the fact she eats so little that her system is slow. I started a dialog with her DR. at the New Year. I had delivered a letter to her home on New Year's Day. She called me on the 2nd and agreed that my lady has been a difficult case. I called Dr. and said I think things are getting dire and gave same description. Dr. had called my wife for a mandatory appointment tomorrow! The reason I am sharing this is I suspected an issue when we were dating in 1989/90, wrote it off as something people were talking about too much (Karen Carpenter was in the news at the time). I fell in love, made a family, it's been good. But this issue has been front of mind to me for nearly 4 years. She's dancing on a high wire / knife edge of functioning. NEDA doesn't allow us to use numbers and such, but I will bet $ her mass is not X digits tomorrow. Things socially in my home are going to get pretty ugly, and from what I have read about ladies much younger than mine she may have to be hospitalized. She's the bread winner right now, she's stressed, I'm stressed. We made a family... but I feel trapped by my choice. I am starting to imagine my life without her. Will COVID get her and knock her frail body out? Will she have a breakdown when she's told to take a week off or spend 2 weeks in a program? Will her company let her go as the don't have much loyalty to anyone who's spent 30 years with them. It's high stakes, and the choice we all make in a partner is heady. I didn't think I deserved her way back when... we have been a great team, but its like being married to a super star that has a self destructive alter - ego. This issue is a whole other can of worms, people are too polite to confront (her family). That's all I have to say. I'm 54, I met her in '88, and it's be great... but I am afraid I'll spend my empty nest years alone, because I used to be afraid the flue would get her and now we have COVID, and from what I have read a cardiac event could get her, or worse ""refeeding syndrome"" looks to be a possibility if she slips much farther.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,08/19/2020-7:40pm","Since you mention that you're worried about refeeding syndrome, we are providing you with a list of medical emergency signs and symptoms to look out for:The following are just some of the signs of a serious problem that demands immediate medical attention:

And yeah, you often hear the same question ""Do I want to be healthy and happy, or do I want to continue with my ED ?"" One would think that the answer would be obvious, but the way that EDs worm their ways into people's brains, it's honestly not an obvious choice for them at all.  So you do kind of have to respect that, particularly if you're going to have a useful conversation with them, as crazy as that may seem to outsiders.I suspect your wife knows that it's an issue though?  ""The tribe"" on the ED boards…even if they are still going for it…they also understand that in the long run it's not a good thing.  It's pretty much ""tribal wisdom"" these days that EDs are things which cause people a big pile of trouble in all sorts of realms of life, even if what you find yourself wanting the most is just to get thinner and thinner. So yeah, I don't know what to tell you that will help much.Because it's going to be up to her as to want sort of choices she wants, and what sorts of emotional risks she'll be willing to take.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The childhood abuse that he suffered, that really can have an important effect on a person, and it's possible that it's even more important than his eating disorder, as far as something that is having an effect on his life, and the ways that he feels about himself inside.  Like that EDs can be a symptom of something bigger, you know ?This is going to sound obvious I know, but is there some way that he can get some therapy ?  Often issues like these are not something that a partner can solve.  Because our relationship with the person, and the role that it's proper for us to play,  is different than the relationship that they would have with a therapist.

What has helped in my marriage,  me being the one to struggle,  is knowing my husband loves me no matter my size.   He would encourage me to eat, but not force it on me.  Having his hand to hold when I wss consumed with thoughts about eating,  food, body image really helped over the past 4 years of relapsing.   Having him be encouraging when I was down about myself and believing in me when I didn't believe in myself really helped.  Being able to trust my husband 100 percent really helped.
  But I also realized that I needed more help than he could give me.  Having those boundaries was essential to my recovery.   It's coming up on 4 months of being in recovery.

41,07/13/2020,Arguments,smalls40,"My partner and I have been together for about a year and a half.  About 3-4 months in she confessed she about her ED.  I have remained as supportive as possible even going to in person support groups when she requested.  I've read articles, attended webinars, and have read these forums regularly.  She recently has started both therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for ED.  She's made some serious improvements and I'm sosososo proud of her for them.  However, she is still struggling with controlling her anxiety.  She lashes out at me often and treats me like a punching bag on low days.  I recently started therapy again myself too because she's damaged my own  self-esteem throughout our relationship.  I was strong enough in the beginning to support her and take those lashes, but I'm not that emotionally or mentally strong anymore.  I'm even questioning if she actually loves me or is she is using ED as an excuse to just be mean to me when she wants to.  It's somehow always ED or some other anxiety that she claims are causing her to be mean.I'm just looking to see if other people also suffer from the ED damages like this too and how to cope or manage it.  I love this woman with everything in me, but it's getting increasingly more difficult to continually take the arguments she causes due to the ED voices.  I'm feeling more and more drained and I'm uncertain where to turn or how to manage this anymore. I've been wondering if now is the time to exit the relationship so she can fully grow without worrying about us and the relationship we have so she can heal since she's entering a more intense form of therapy.Any advice would be much appreciated.",BobJ48,"Mon,07/13/2020-11:30pm","Hey Smalls,"" It's somehow always ED or some other anxiety that she claims are causing her to be mean.""She's probably telling the truth about that, so I think you can take that for granted.  And while I don't know what her situation is, if I had to guess, now that she's started therapy, she's probably finding recovery to be harder than she thought it might be, or questioning whether she wants to recover at all.  And here you are, being Mr Supportive, which kind of just pisses her off. So yeah, people often go through a whole lot of ambivalence, when they start to consider recovery.  And even when they are making a run at it sometimes. It can sort of start driving them crazy, because everything they are supposed to be asking of themselves just doesn't feel right to them at all.  Particularly right in the beginning. You might try letting her know that you understand that, and that you know there must be a lot of inner battles that she's fighting. Along with worries about people's expectations for her.  Because that's likely where a lot of this is coming from. And honestly, you're not being a wimp by letting this effect you. Here you are, bringing your best energy and love to the situation, and what do you get in return ?  Rather than thanks, it's arguments and resentments instead.  Which…are not the sort of lessons that we need to be learning when we are trying to do our best by someone.  As much as we'd like the believe that the ""Love is all you need"" thing is really going to help, a lot of times it's much more complicated than that.  I tend to believe that it can help in the long run, but don't expect it to be obvious right in the moment. So I can't really give you any recommendations. It's totally reasonable for you to want to look out for your own health in a situation like this, and you'd probably feel some relief if you distanced yourself from all this. Would this be beneficial for her as well ?  Hard to say, but if she's feeling lousy about her success with recovery, the fact that she's driving you away may not help her to feel a lot better about herself.  Even though a part of her might feel OK about you leaving. I'm sure you've seen all the ""She's pushing me away"" posts here, but I rarely think that there's much that's healthy about that. However, despite all the discord, if it seems like she's not quite in favor of you guys breaking up yet, that might be a hopeful sign. In any case, no one is going to condemn you, no matter what choice you make.  As you are finding out, we can't be expected to be a saint forever, and a person has a responsibility to themselves as well. Bob J",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,07/06/2020,Girlfriendpushingmeaway,sourcandy14,For over a month now my girlfriend had been very distant and I was wondering why and she wouldn’t tell me she said she’s just focusing on herself and that she is just doing this alone I kept personalizing it and thought it was me or the relationship that we had and I asked her multiple times and told her that I’m not happy that I’m not happy in finally over a month she told me that she has been going to see a psychiatrist which I don’t know if it’s true or not but she said that she was diagnosed with anorexia and that she only has her self and she hast to get through this alone I tried to assure her that I’m here for her and she got agitated withWith me and it’s like every time she’s around me she just gets agitated and wants to leave her friends house she said I’m the only one that knows and doesn’t want her best friend knowing because she feels like he will be all worried she told me two days ago and I have not heard from her since even though we both live together she’s been ignoring my texts and calls I don’t know if I should give her space or what else to do I feel like she’s taking this out on me and she’s making me to be out to be the bad guy I don’t know if space will work or not but I feel like it’s the only option everyone else keeps telling me I need to break up with her because I relationship isn’t healthy but that’s the last thing I want I just don’t know how to get through to her and for her to stop being so annoyed/agitated with me,BobJ48,"Wed,07/08/2020-6:40pm","I just saw your note, but it's after midnight here, so hang in there and I'll try and get back to you in the morning !(OK I'm back )One thing to keep in mind is that people can be really conflicted about their ED.  On the one hand they are beginning to suspect they're in trouble, while on the other hand they're horrified of being asked to gain weight.  Granted they know that EDs are bad, but eating and not restricting simply doesn't feel like the right thing at all.So of course they know other people (as well as therapists and doctors) are going to be saying ""Oh you need to start eating !"" and that they may be keeping a close eye on them in any situation that involves food.  So just imagine how that must be for them.So yes, the solution can seem to be pushing people away, so that they don't have to deal with well-intentioned helpers or people talking about food or asking what they plan to do about their situation, or any of that. Because it sounds like she's in the stage of her ED where she really doesn't know what she wants to do.And that might be what you'll want to say to her.  ""It must be a really difficult to not knowing what you want to do about this.""  Because that's what it sounds like she's struggling with.  And why she feels wary about other people knowing. Because she already knows what they're going to think, and probably what they'll say too, but it's still something that she hasn't made up her mind about yet.Which can be an awfully uncomfortable feeling, and may be the source of much of the crankiness and agitation that you're seeing from her.And everything Alyki said below too.",alyki8,"Wed,07/08/2020-5:38am","Hi sourcandy14, I hope you're going okay. I am by no means an expert at this but I thought I would reach out just because I am in a very similar position. My girlfriend was diagnosed with anorexia last week and has similarly been pushing me away, becoming agitated, getting defensive, self-isolating. I too am finding it difficult because sometimes it feels really personal - even if it's not. It can also feel like no matter what you say, you have said the wrong thing. From a combination of my own experience and advice that I have already received from people on this forum, there are a few things to note about this situation. 1) Often people with EDs distance themselves because they don't think they are worthy of love/support. They think that they have to suffer in silence because no one will care if they told them, they would become a burden, or simply because they want to be able to continue their self-destructive behaviours in peace. While there's no simple solution to this problem, hopefully that gives you some insight into why she's acting that way. 2) Communication is key. Whilst you can't pressure them into having a conversation, it is important that you address it. If you let the problem grow and balloon without talking about it, both of you will end up the worse for it. Try and sit her down in person - in a comfortable environment, after a mealtime, face-to-face, no one else around - and raise some of these issues with her. Some of the following affirmations could be helpful: 'I really value this relationship. You are worthy. I love/really care for you. It hurts me to see you sufferring. You don't have to give me the nitty gritty details but I think we should talk about this'. Ask her things like 'how can I best support you? Is there something I can do better?'3) Try not to take things personally. Ultimately, anorexia is a mental illness and people act out of character because of it. I know it's hard, but try and step above and recognise that the reason they are acting bitchy is because they are in pain.4) Just because it is hard, it doesn't mean you should break up. I was given similar advice that I should break up with my girlfriend, just because things were getting hard. But if you are really committed to someone, you are committed to them through thick and thin. If you really love this girl, don't listen to what other people say. I hope any of that helps!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,07/02/2020,Mygirlfriend'sfreshdiagnosis,alyki8,"Hello everyone, I am a new member of this forum. Unfortunately, my girlfriend was today diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. I was pretty shattered by this news, as I imagine many partners/spouses are. I feel somewhat culpable - I should have noticed, I should have acted earlier, I should have helped. I know these are all irrational thoughts and that it is not my fault, but I feel them nonetheless.My girlfriend verbalised to me about a month ago that she was struggling with eating. She said that if in one month's time she hadn't reached a specified weight (she did not tell me what this was) she would seek professional health. True to her word she did so and received the diagnosis. I know that in the past she has also struggled with anxiety, self-harm and depressive episodes. We are both in our final year of high school. It has been an incredibly stressful year in terms of school work, friendships etc. She is particularly susceptible to stress. We were also in lockdown due to Covid-19 for approximately three months meaning that we missed all of that face-to-face school. This was a period of time in which she lost a lot of weight, isolated herself socially and struggled with mental health. Oftentimes, I was the ONLY person that she would talk to outside of her family. I am grateful that she felt comfortable enough to communicate honestly but it was oftentimes pretty frightening.I am the only person outside of her family that knows of this issue. I am trying to be diligent about how I can best support her and have been reading up all afternoon about the disorder itself, different methods of support, recovery time and techniques. I have come to this forum, however, to ask specifically if anyone has been in a similar situation. Has anyone had to deal with their final year of school, all the stress that comes with that, and an unwell loved one? Or being the sole non-familial supporter? The other thing I am concerned about is maintaining an equal and loving relationship alongside a mental illness. She also received a fairly early diagnosis - how can I help her slipping further into the grips of this illness?I am not sure of what demographic uses this forum (I imagine it is varied), but I hope that you all can understand that despite being young, I really think that this girl is the one for me. I love her so dearly and it pains me greatly to see her suffering. I want to help in whatever ways I can because this relationship and this person mean the world to me. I am in for the long haul. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank-you xx",BobJ48,"Fri,07/03/2020-12:13pm","Not that many normies are familiar with EDs, so I'm glad you understand that it's OK that it took a while to figure it out.

You didn't mention if she was going to move forward with therapy though. Has she taken steps towards doing that do you think ?"" I am trying to be diligent about how I can best support her and have been reading up all afternoon about the disorder itself, different methods of support, recovery time and techniques.""Good that you're doing this reading.  Not very many guys make that sort of effort, or would come here to post a message, so that puts you ahead of most guys.You may have figured out that there's no agreed upon magic bullet that cures people either. People really do get better, but the reasons for getting better are often quite individual.  So us being able to ""fix"" the person…it's not really something that we can expect of ourselves.  Which can lead to feelings of helplessness if we don't get ahold of the right perspective. But it doesn't mean there's nothing we can do either.  People with EDs often have other issues in their lives that lead to all of this food and weight concern.  Worries about not being ""good enough"" as a person, various other things that happened to them in their past, lots of personal self-doubts just in general.  People are often alone with those feelings, and someone to talk to about those things can make a difference I think.  So it's good that the two of you are able to talk.

It was very comforting to read what you were saying about not being able to ""fix"" someone. I totally get what you mean and I think I will just have to continue working to establish those boundaries between what is within my power/my responsibility and what is actually the responsibility of her family/a professional. Yes she is starting therapy this week and, yes, I am very proud of her for visiting the doctors under her own steam. She has always been very brave and straightforward. If you wouldn't mind, I just have one other question that has kind of come up in the last few days - sometimes when she gets to a really low place, she will lash out or be really cold. She has told me that she does this in order to 'protect' me and because she doesn't feel worthy of friends. I know it is only coming from a place of insecurity, not malice, but I still find it really tricky to navigate. It definitely hurts when she becomes super flippant/callous/mean.

By this I mean we have a responsibility for our own actions. We cannot make someone else do something. We cannot give them the thoughts they should think.  We cannot cure them, and it is not our responsibility to even try.  We are not doctors. We can empathize.  We can let them know we are sorry they are struggling, but in the end, it is their responsibility to do the work to get better.  It is their responsibility to love themselves enough to save themselves.  You cannot instill that in them no matter how hard you try.  It is their life to live as they want to live it.Instead, you might want to look into yourself to find out why out of all the mentally healthy girls that are around you, you are choosing to spend time with someone who causes you to worry and to deal with mental illness.  That is not a recipe that ends well.Sending best wishes.",alyki8,"Mon,07/06/2020-12:23am","Thank you so much for getting back to me.

I think I agree with you on this in principle but I'm finding it hard to implement. Do you think that's really all we can do? Tell them we are sorry and that we are here but otherwise let them fend for themselves?

They can feel full of self-hate, and unworthy of love and concern.  People with EDs can also be ""Hangry"" - the sort of cranky mood that people can find themselves in when they haven't been eating enough. Acting mean, and like she doesn't care about about your feelings is often a way that people try to prove to themselves that they actually are a bad and undeserving person.  ""Having feelings"" ; it's all just so tedious, you know ?  So the person can put on a show where they act like they are uncaring.  And above any of those boring sorts of feelings.  On the eating disorders boards, you'll often see topics like ""Are you a bitch?"" and people will talk about how terrible of a person they are.  When actually they are pretty nice people. "" She has told me that she does this in order to 'protect' me.""  This is probably true to some degree. She doesn't want you to be disappointed in her, so she works up an act where you actually would have a reason to feel disappointed in her.Plus the person can be legitimately upset with themselves as a person.  So maybe you are seeing some of that too.While it's convoluted ,it's also probably the most common thing that guys come to ask about.  The ""pushing away"" thing I mean.  So you are not the only guy who's found themselves in this same boat.  It's an awfully big boat to be honest. How does a person respond to it though?  I'm not sure.

Getting into an argument about how they are ""supposed"" to feel can be a losing proposition it's true.But you did mention what may be a connection between her current eating behavior, and some recent events which have been difficult for her.  And it's true; if these events caused her to feel…not in control of her life, or brought up old and unresolved issues from her past, then there very well may be a connection.What I'm getting at is that while you may not be able to effectively talk with her about food right now, it's possible that you could help her express her feels more openly about the other issues you mentioned.

It can be incredibly challenging and draining to talk about one's ED. Some good questions/statements that have helped me in the past are:'How can I best support you right now?'
'I am trying my best to support you. How can I be better?'
'How did it make you feel when I said/did....?'
'We don't have to talk about this right now, but I want to continue this conversation in the future so as we can work through this.'
'I am doing this from a place of love and I'm sorry if it coming across as intrusive/rude/inconsiderate.'Another really important point to stress is that person's worth. Make it crystal clear that you love them and have good intentions. Something along the lines of:
'I can see that you are hurting/struggling right now.'
'I don't understand but I empathise and I hate to see you in pain.'
'I love you/I really appreciate you/I am very grateful for you and I want you to be as happy as possible. You are very important to me.'That all being said, it is not your responsibility to cure them. Your goals should be to a) support and love that person, b) encourage them to seek professional help and c) continue looking after yourself so as you can continue supporting them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,06/10/2020,"NothingIdohelps,nothingisenough",idontknowanymore,"I don't know what to do anymore. My long distance girlfriend (23) lives with her family, which includes a verbally abusive mother who especially focuses on weight. She makes disgusting comments on my girlfriend's weight and body daily and tries to control what she eats by either manipulating her or actually taking food from her plate, for example. A few days ago my girlfriend went to a restaurant (it was her idea, which makes me happy) and she said ""This is the first time I had a real meal in a very long time, they won't let me eat much at home"". She managed to eat everything and said she felt happy about it. But all isn't good. Because most of the time, she believes her mom. She thinks she's right and that she needs to lose more weight despite almost being underweight now. She also stopped going to therapy. During the 6 weeks or so she was quarantined she actually had online therapy every week. But then she skipped one week's session and blamed it on stress. Then she skipped the next week too. And the next. And the next. Now she hasn't been in therapy for a month or so, but trust me, she needs it! She needs help! I've tried to ask her why she doesn't wanna go, but I don't get any real answers. Yesterday she said it's because she needs to save money so that she can visit me. I offered to pay for her flight ticket so that she could still go to therapy, but she said ""no I don't wanna go, I wanna see you and weigh x kilograms"". This morning I told her that I had written anonymously to an ""online help mental health"" thing to get some advice and asked if she wanted to see what they replied. She became angry and asked what the hell I have done. She said she can't trust me and that she won't tell me anything anymore. That I'm using the things she tells me against her. That her mom is right and loves her.I feel terrible. Nothing that I do works. Nothing! We've been together for almost 2 years, always long distance in other countries, and a few times I have felt hope that she was realizing what was going on and about to take action. Like, last month for example. She screamed when she saw new and old pictures of herself because she saw how much weight she had lost and it scared her. I know that there's a part of her that's also scared and wants to recover, but it's really hard when her mom is such a *********..... And unfortunately, she believes her mom most of the time. I don't know what to do anymore. No matter what I do, her mom's voice is always louder. She's even angry at me for trying to help but not angry at her mom for insulting her daily. I feel like I'm losing my girlfriend because of her mother. I don't know what to do.",BobJ48,"Wed,06/10/2020-5:25pm","I'm glad you took the time to write, as I know how worrisome this must be for you.And yeah, we rarely gain points by badmouthing parents, but they are people like anyone else, and can sometimes bring their own issues to a situation in ways that just tangle matters up even more.  So yes, I'm sorry that you seem to be up against that angle too.It's hard to say about your GF, but that's often how it goes too.  On the one hand they understand that they may be in trouble, while on the other hand, everything's ""fine"" and continuing weight loss seems the only thing that feels right on a gut level.  It can present a real dilemma for the person, when they find themselves up against conflicting feelings like this.  As she herself would probably admit.Plus eating disorders don't like to be threatened.  Therapy is dangerous that way, as well as you coming here to ask for advice. So there's that too, along with ""My mom loves me"" and ""I don't want anyone to be overly concerned"" (meaning you) and the whole thing really can add up to a big conflicting emotional mess. One question you might ask her is what is it that she wants.  People can give a lot of different answers to this, depending on how deep they want to go.  ""I just want to be thin."" is probably what you'd hear first.  But what does that mean on a deeper level ?  ""I just want to be perfect"" is another answer.  But it's the same thing - what would that mean to her emotionally, if somehow she was ?  ""I just want to be left alone"" can be an answer too.   But we are social animals at our core, so why would a person want that ?Maybe these are things she was being asked in therapy, so they may be questions that she doesn't want to answer.  But I suspect that she knows that they're important. Plus there's the stress of feeling like she has to please everyone.  You, her mom, the therapist, and probably most difficult of all, herself.In any case, it sounds like it was a victory for her to go to the restaurant. It sounds like she felt that it was, and that's great.  Food can be such an enemy sometimes, so the fact that it wasn't for once ( or at least not terribly so ) sounds like a plus.As to what you can do, you might want to ask her how she feels you might help ?  Sometimes we forget to ask that. It doesn't mean that you have to agree, if her suggestions don't sound particularly healthy to you, but it's probably not bad to ask, if only to let her know that you're on her side.In any case, just some thoughts.  If you want to let her see this, I'd be fine with that.  I'm basically just some random person, but I've been on a lot of boards with people in her situation, so I'm definitely on her side too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,06/09/2020,Anorexia,Odysseus10919,"Hi everyone, my girlfriend has an eating disorder and I just want to help her in the best way that I can, she has suffered from bulimia in the past and right now she is suffering from anorexia and I am really worried she is going to go back to making herself throw up. She is eating only when I am around and I just want her to love herself and not feel bad about eating. I blame myself for it. After every time she eats weather its with me or not she feels guilty and tells me that it is physically hard for her to eat food and that she thinks that her body just cannot handle food anymore. I feel like everything I do doesn't help. I want to do the best that I can to help her through this. I'm scared that if this goes on for too long that there will be some of the lasting effects of it. *heart disease, osteoporosis, etc.* She doesn't think that treatment would work even though I think it will. I don't want to be in control and force her to eat but I really do not know what to do. please help",BobJ48,"Wed,06/10/2020-3:50am","It's just us chickens here, answering posts, and not the NEDA folks, so if it takes a while to get a response, that's why. So I hope you won't be disappointed if this reply is a little late.And yeah, things with EDs can be difficult. And since it's so hard to ""say the right things"" it's easy for us to feel that we're somehow to blame. So I hope you can trust me when I say that…it's not you, and nothing that you are or are not saying that's causing her to behave as she does.  If somehow you were a big abusive jerk, it might be different.  But instead you're the sort of partner who'd come to a site like this to look for help.  Which already puts you ahead of a lot of fellows.To be honest, I'm seeing some positive things in your note.  It's not uncommon for people with EDs to not want to talk to their boyfriends about their EDs.  Often they'll actually hide it. So the fact that she's talking to you counts as progress, and a positive thing, even if she's still in the grips of her ED. ""I just want her to love herself…""No kidding, that's a big part of all this.  People with EDs can have a really hard time with self-hate, and feeling like they are worthy of having a good life.  They can also feel like they are just a burden on everyone.  It's tempting to take the approach of telling them how wonderful you think that they are, but it's going to be hard for them to believe it.   In my experience it's better to say things like ""It must be difficult to always feel so poorly about yourself.""  That may seem like a negative thing to say, but you might be surprised at how much better she feels, knowing that someone else understands what she's going through.   My sense has always been that people want to be known…and feel understood.  So keep that in mind when you are figuring out what to say to her.""I don't want to be in control and force her to eat.""Yep, that's definitely not an approach that's going to work, so your instincts are right about that.  ""She doesn't think that treatment would work…""Yes, a lot of people with EDs feel that same way.  And to be frank, for a lot of people it doesn't.  But why it does or does not work has a lot to do with the attitude that the person has.  Like if they think it's possible for them to get better, they have a much better chance at a good outcome than if they don't think they will.  So it often comes down to people being willing to take a risk with treatment. It might not help, that but then again it could.  Is the person willing to take the risk that things might not work out ?  So the ""being willing to take a risk"" is a theme you might go with, when the subject of treatment comes up.So maybe as you are figuring out, it's unlikely that you are going to fix things for her.  But at the same time, being an understanding and supporting person doesn't count as nothing either.  Anyhow, it's getting late here, and I know there's a lot of stuff I didn't cover.  But hopefully some of this helped, and that you'll keep writing if any of it seemed to.BobJ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,04/13/2020,Doesn'tbelieveinclinicalapproach,benberk27,"My girlfriend struggles with bulimia nervosa. She was recovered when we first met, and relapsed while dating. She's very open about it with me. The issue I'm facing is she won't seek professional help. In her mind, she went this route for 10+ years before her recovery, and it's a waste of time. She disagrees with the approach.So she's trying to do it on her own. She's taken the brain over binge program, and is actively trying new approaches. I admire this about her, but objectively she isn't seeing results. Things appear to be getting worse.I've read a lot about the disorder. I listen intently, support her, and I don't push her recovery. But I'm stuck. Our conversations often go the route of the victim, where she tells me how bad it is, how I don't understand (no-one does), she's going to lose her teeth, etc. It's emotionally exhausting and makes me feel like an enabler.I feel compassion for her suffering, but I don't know how to best help her on her journey. If I ask her she'll say ""you can't"" or ""if I knew what I needed for help I'd do it myself"".Has anyone been in this spot? Any advice?",dittoditto,"Mon,04/13/2020-10:36pm","Hi benberk.  I am sorry you are going through this.  The problem is that you cannot help her.  I know that sounds a little cold, and probably very emotionally hard, but it is the fact.  She is an adult.  She is making her choices.  You need to set your boundaries.  By this I mean that her problems belong to her and your problems belong to you.  You should tend to your problems and let her tend to her problems.The other thing I would suggest is that you stop talking to ED.  ED loves an audience.  Whenever Ed pops up trying to talk to you about the eating disorder, weight, food, or anything body-perception oriented, just say you won't talk to ED and change the topic.Also, try joining Ala-non.  It is a program that works for addicts of any stripe, and ED is an addiction as much as it is a mental illness.  The very first thing you will learn is that you did not cause this, you cannot control it, and you cannot cure it.  Once you take that responsibility off of your shoulders, this relationship will get a lot easier for you.Finally, a good therapist for yourself is priceless.  It is very helpful to have someone who can help us to deal with this.Sending you best wishes in your struggle.",BobJ48,"Tue,04/14/2020-6:25pm","Some terrific advice from dittoditto above.  Getting a grip on what you can and cannot control is a big part of being in your position.And honestly, your GF has a point about professional help.  Not that it can't be of assistance, because sometimes it can be, but more from the standpoint that as long as she believes it's unlikely to help…it's probably not going to help. So even if she were to get help, she'd still need to be taking responsibility for her recovery.  We like to think that therapists or other professionals possess some kind of magic cure, but it simply doesn't work that way.  Even if she had the best therapist in the world, how things worked out would still be her responsibility.At the same time, EDs are really difficult matters.  Even with a deep commitment to recovery, the struggle can still be enormous.  So the fact that she seems to be trying to self-recover;  that really does count for something I think. ""Things appear to be getting worse.""Yep, that can happen.  EDs are a lot about control, and if things feel out of control, then a person's symptoms can get worse.  If she is pursuing self-recovery with the same sort of iron will that got her into this situation in the first place,  and yet not seeing results, well…it's going to feel to her like (you guessed it)  she's not in control.   A feeling which can prompt symptoms to get worse rather than better. It's hard to recommend that she take a more casual approach to recovery.  But if she can let go of some of her perfectionism, and allow there to be some bumps in the road, and be self-forgiving when there are….rather than trying to clamp down on her behaviors even more severely, maybe that can help loosen up the control-issue thing just a little?Dare to be imperfect, you know ? In any case, just a few thoughts.Keep writing if it seems to help ?",benberk27,"Mon,05/25/2020-12:54pm","This was great advice, and helped me connect more with the frustration she's feeling. Thank you for this. She's been going through a difficult stretch and I came back to read this.I'm writing because I had a conversation with her shortly after about 'control' and she had a different perspective that I wanted to share. People may experience this differently, but when she chooses ED she feels a loss of control. This makes logical sense to me given what binging is, it's addictive qualities, and how it must feel when you can't stop. This doesn't change any of the advice, but maybe someone else can connect with this thought and I wanted to share it.",BobJ48,"Mon,05/25/2020-6:17pm","Hey BB,""...I had a conversation with her shortly after about 'control' and she had a different perspective that I wanted to share. People may experience this differently, but when she chooses ED she feels a loss of control.""Yes, and I'm not surprised.  In the beginning, people hope they can restrict and lose weight.  This sort of commitment really can feel like  a matter of ""taking control"" of their lives.  But it's really hard for most people to successfully restrict in the ways they might hope to.  Often they slip up, and in their hunger, they often eat a bunch of food at one setting.  But then they can have this big discovery - they can purge and get rid of it.  This brings back their feelings of control.  Folks will often continue to try and restrict, but since they have this way to get rid of what they eat, they will often plan out times when they will binge and purge.  Because heck, they can do all this eating, but then if they purge…there's no damage, and they don't have to worry about that calories.   So yay !!Until it turns into a habit, that is.  And they find that it's in control of them, rather than the other way around.  Which sounds like the stage that your girlfriend is in.   This really is the paradox of EDs.  What started out as something that helped a person feel in control turns into the exact opposite of that, once it gets it's hooks into a person.  People can sometimes fall into depression when they reach this stage of their ED.  One thing that can be helpful is if they can find ways to shuck off some of the shame that they feel, because people with bulimia often feel shame. Being able to not be so hard on one's self when they find themselves in this position is important I think.   Being gentle in  one's self-judgments and being open to self-forgiveness…these things are important I think. Anyhow, just a few more thoughts.   It was good to see your note, and I hope you can keep writing when you feel the need to get some of your thoughts out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,05/09/2020,Mypartnerthinksprofessionalhelpwon'twork,Gabriel2846,"Hello everyone,my partner is suffering from Bulimia for about 10 years (we are together since 3 years).We already spoke about her sickness and I told her that I will try to help her as good as I can.

Another thing she mentioned once is that she maybe doesn't want it to go away and it might be always a part of her. How in the world should am I suppose to deal with this and help her at the same time.I know this is not about me but I am not able to live with this if she wants the Bulimia to stay a part of her life. Anyone in a similar situation or any advice what I could do?Thanks to everyone taking their time to read and answer this.Stay safe and healthy,Gabriel",BobJ48,"Mon,05/11/2020-7:26pm","Hey there.Yes, many people with eating disorders worry that their ED will be a part of themselves forever.  Eating disorders can be really persistent, and can come back later when people feel stressed, or feel that they are losing control of their life.  As you said, for some people they can become  a daily habit. And like she said, some people can wonder if they want it to go away or not.  As though it has become the only way they know to cope with life's difficulties. However, it's been my experience that these people are usually not happy about their situation.  And wish that they had never become trapped in it to begin with. ""...she has already been in treatment for a 2 years about 5 years ago and told me that treatment won't work for her.""Unfortunately some people often have bad experiences with treatment.  They are in and out of different programs, but just go back to their old habits again once they get out.  This can be very discouraging for them, and can cause them to lose faith in the idea of treatment. On the other hand, most people in the ED community will tell you that the attitude that a person brings to treatment can be what makes the most difference.  If people approach treatment feeling that they will never get better, then often they don't get better.  If people come to the very same treatment, with a desire to get better, and a willingness to take the sorts of risks that treatment can involve, those people often have a much better outcome. My sense is that it's the risk-taking part that makes the difference.  If they are willing to take a risk with treatment, knowing that it may or may not work for them, but with the hope that it will, and they go for themselves, rather than going in order to try and please others, than that's when better outcomes can happen. But you are right : I'm not sure what you can do.   if you let her know that you can understand some of the mental struggles she is going though, then that can help, I think.   All the self-doubts she must have about the whole situation.  Because people with EDs often have a lot of self-doubts.  You are right though, for yourself and for other partners, it can become intolerable having to deal with this, and never being sure of the outcome.So you need to take care of yourself too, if you know what I mean ?Keep writing ?Bob J.",dittoditto,"Tue,05/12/2020-8:44pm","Hi Gabriel, I take a different approach to the situation:""I know this is not about me but I am not able to live with this if she wants the Bulimia to stay a part of her life.""  Unfortunately it is about you. Whenever you let anyone into your life their behaviors automatically effect you. For that reason, it is a healthy response to set boundaries on the type of behaviors you will accept.ED can be really rough.  Not only does this illness harm their health and their bodies but it changes their personality and impairs their cognitive functioning.  These people have a very hard time maintaining relationships and that means that ultimately you can be hurt.Your focus needs to be on you and what you need.  Let your partner focus on themselves and what they need.  You have choices you can make.  If you decide that you don't want this to be part of your life, that is a very valid decision and you can make the changes you need for yourself.  You are not required to deal with mental illness.  And it is not your responsibility to fix them.  Always remember: you did not cause it, you cannot control it, you cannot cure it.",benberk27,"Mon,05/25/2020-1:13pm","Gabriel, I've been in a similar place (doesn't believe in professional help) and I thought maybe I could help.The comment that she ""maybe doesn't want it to go away"" would concern me as well. I would get curious about this comment. All of us can say things we don't mean when we're emotional, and unfortunately ED can bring with it a lot of emotional moments. She may have felt defeated at the time, or maybe she truly means it. If you find a calm time to ask her gently about this you might be able to connect with her more and see where she is. Bob has great advice in trying to understand her and connect more in those moments, and it makes a huge difference when she feels you can understand.Once you have some clarity you can decide what is best for you.

49,04/25/2020,13years,westsidetime,"My mind is eaten up by the years of lies and betrayal that my wife's bulimia has caused.
We've been together 13 years. Star struck lovers with bold plans for our futures.About 6 years in she admitted to me about her bulimia. I studied about it, braced myself for it and even went to therapy with her. I've never had a problem with the bulimia itself. I've caught her binging at times and gotten (i think) good at telling when she's in the throes of it. Its unhealthy and I know she's getting better. I proudly support her and the woman she's become through it.In the meantime, we went through some very lean years, and we both come from humble origins, and those 'bold' plans required a commitment to getting out of debt, establishing good careers, saving money, etc. Significant financial planning. Moreover it required us (and our careers) working toward one another.Early on (like 2 years in) she got a job at a non-profit. A prestigious company that didn't pay (as with most non-profits). I would counsel her to leverage the prestigious non-profit into the for-profit world and get a job that can help with our 'bold' future... at a minimum help with the debts and expenses.  Put our finances ahead of a non-profits finances. Relatedly, I hate her job. I loath it. While it's prestigious, her boss is a psychopath.  For years, deep in the lean years, my wife would come home after a day of work in tears from her boss being cruel and manipulative. Her boss would demean her, demean me, demean our marriage..and under pay for extreme hours of work.She ignored me and ignored our plans for the future. I didn't connect this to her bulimia. Ultimately she used the non-profit as a way to hide her bulimia and to deal with some very significant insecurities.  Insecurities I was only vaguely aware of (aren't we all insecure?).About 3 years ago I snapped. After yet another year of hopeful/naive encouragement (""Please leave your job and do something that will help toward that future we always wanted""). I think she sincerely feels she's doing her best but its not enough.  As of today she's still at that job. She still struggles with insecurities about how to move on.  It's almost like a Stockholm syndrome, she's survived at this job for 10+ years and now feels she can't move on (skills and resume to match a job market).  Ultimately this just leads me to a cycle of thoughts that I tried for years to prevent, to be supportive and encouraging and that it was all wasted effort. That our communication was all lies.  And now while we talk more and I'm aware of the dimensions, I don't want the life that bulimia has forced on us.  I fought hard for the 'bold' future and I still want it. I feel betrayed and dismissed. Hoodwinked. A bold future is still very much possible, just not with her.  I want to be happy and I haven't been happy in a long time.I'm not sure why I posted. I just don't know who to turn to. I don't know that a therapist would help.  My heart is broken. I love her but I don't want the life she & bulimia are forcing on us.",BobJ48,"Mon,04/27/2020-2:15pm","Westside,This sounds like a matter for marriage counseling.  Your resentments are real, and the two of you will need to confront them at some point.

So it's possible that she'll feel put-upon, and like the one being blamed, which will make matters difficult too.None the less, it sounds like things may be coming to a head for you ?   Which no matter who may be in the right or the wrong, still counts as a legitimate issue. So yes, I'd recommend giving couples counseling at try, before you begin to think about giving up on things altogether.

51,03/12/2020,ConcernedWife,flowerflower,"Hi All,First, I want to thank you for taking the time to read what I have to say. Until I found about NEDA and their forums I was finding myself in a really lonely place. I have not shared this story with a single soul and it's starting to way heavy on me. My husband and I have been together for over 10 years now and ever since the beginning I have had a gut feeling that he has been purging. Years back in one of our first apartments I noticed vomit out by the dumpster, often. In that same house I found a bucket filled with this horrible smelling substance in his closest which I feel very confident was vomit. There has always been a reason or an ""I Don't Know"" for everything I found.  Fast forward many years and I have wavered in and out of suspecting something was up. During the times I felt all was well there was major relief. I didn't have to worry, and didn't have to worry about bringing it up. I'm not saying that it wasn't happening, but maybe I wasn't noticing it?I have examples and reasons to think that he may be purging, but it's gotten to the point where it's really hard to have a discussion or conversation around his health. He works hard and he has a lot on his plate. I often check in to make sure he is sleeping enough, not drinking to much caffeine, not chewing, etc - I can see how me asking would be SUPER annoying. I care. A few months back when I brought up purging specifically he did say he did throw up when he gets stressed. It wasn't much of a conversation, but he didn't get defensive. I did bring up again this past Sunday though as something happened that brought this feeling back to life. I used that Sundays example and the examples from years past to share why I have concerns. He understood why I brought it up, but was in complete denial. He was very dismissive, got agitated, and made a point to say he didn't know and didn't want to talk about it further. We are now going on day 3 of essentially not talking to each other. I feel like he wants NOTHING to do with me.
I am a very sensitive person and am trying to stay strong - I don't want to say ""I'm sorry"" and have this whole thing blow over.
We are trying to start a family, we have to communicate.I will say he is SO believable when it comes to saying he doesn't purge.
It makes me feel like I am crazy. Am I making this up in my head?
I so so so hope I am. Thank you for taking the time,FlowerFlower",BobJ48,"Mon,03/16/2020-1:11am","Hey Flower - I hope that you see this.And yes, I think you have reasons to be concerned.  That bucket you found in his closet long ago, that's a pretty common thing among people who purge.  Purposely I mean, rather than from being ill.  And nothing that normal people who were sick might do. Plus it's hard not to notice how much he *doesn't* want to talk about it.  He's probably not really in denial to himself, but rather he knows that if he admits to it, then you're going to want him to do something about it.   Which…what concerned partner wouldn't want that, you know ?  So to keep things simple and less complicated, it's better for him to insist that it's nothing. It's hard to say what exactly the situation is, but he may have not been too far off the mark when he said it was related to stress.  When certain people get stressed (which can build up over time) they often deal with that by binging and purging.  Which means they buy a whole lot of food, and then eat every bit of it and then purge.  This can help them feel better in the moment, but there's often a lot of shame attached to it too.  Which can make it difficult to talk about.  Plus that sort of thing is supposed to be a girl thing, which can make it even harder for men to discuss. Plus it can turn into a coping method too, so to some degree people can want to hold onto it.  But again, they wouldn't want others to know.If you want to communicate your concerns a little better, you might try writing them out in a letter ?  You know how it can be when we confront people in person ; they can get all defense just as a matter of instinct.  But if you write him, it gives you the chance to make sure that you say things in a way that will express your concern, but also be supportive too.  When he reads it, he'll have time to really think about how he wants to respond, which could make things easier for him too. Yes, it's a difficult situation, but you are taking a good step by educating yourself about this I think. And there's other reading that you can do too.  Take what I wrote with a grain of salt of course, because you know more of the details than I do, but it is a situation that sounds kind of familiar.Keep writing ?",dittoditto,"Sun,03/29/2020-6:59pm","I am also a concerned wife of a man with ED.  This has been my experience:  as with any mental illness -- or for that matter any personality trait -- it isn't going to change just because you want it to.  He was this way when you met him.  If he wanted to change he would have.  Love does not conquer all.If he gets stressed enough about his situation he will change it.  He will make that decision for himself.  It is not your job as his wife to make that decision for him... and you simply don't have that power.What you have the power to do, is to tend to your own behaviors.  You can learn to detach with love and thereby save your sanity.  You can learn your own boundaries and not cross them.

52,03/18/2020,Girlfriendsuffersfrombulimiawhilestudyinginanothercountry,afmc47,"Hi everyone,I am in a bit of a complex situation. My girlfriend is currently doing her master abroad. Now, a couple of years ago she told me that she had struggled with an eating disorder some years before we met. But, she also mentioned that she had made some significant progress in her recovery.The problem is that now that she is studying abroad, she has relapsed. She told me about it, and I've been trying to be as supportive as I can be. She mentioned that in part it could be caused by the stress associated with studying far from home and from the fact that we are no longer living together (although I've tried to visit her as much as I can).The whole situation has put a lot of pressure on our relationship and to make things more complicated, she had a bad experience with professional help in the past. So whenever I bring up that option, she just dismisses it.So I need some advice on how to give her some support, how to make her feel safe and perhaps not alone. She has made some friends at the place where she is living, but I don't think she trusts them enough to tell them. At the moment, I am the only one who knows about her relapse and she doesn't want to tell her mother because she feels that this might make her mother extremely worried. Finally, the whole situation with COVID-19 makes it impossible for me to travel and give her some face to face support.Thank you for your help.",BobJ48,"Wed,03/18/2020-6:15pm","Afmc, I suspect she's right about it being tied in with stress. And the disruption of the living situation she shared with you.  EDs are often tied into a sense of control and security/insecurity within one's life.  Upset that sense of security, and prior feelings of being on top of things, and relapses can occur.  Letting her know that you understand that part, and not underplaying the insecurities she's feeling may be the best way to go.  When we know that someone else has an understanding of the challenging feelings we're dealing with, there can be some real comfort in that.I'm not sure how secure she feels in her new situation, but if there have been some parts which have been fun or adventuresome, then encouraging her to talk about those things might help a little too.  Sometimes we don't give enough credit to the good parts, you know ?  Once she realizes that there may be some good stuff too, perhaps the idea of being there may begin to feel a little brighter, and she may begin to feel a little bit more in control of her life.  And since EDs are often tied in with feelings of control, or lack of control, things with her ED may improve a little as she starts getting the lay of the land, begins to feel a bit more mastery over her situation.If that makes any sense ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,03/17/2020,Ineedadvicewith,Anonymous452,I need advice with my girlfriend who has been suffering with an eating disorder since she was young. She’s been on this struggle for about 5 years or so. She was diagnosed with anorexia but recently she told me she feels as if she is beginning to develop binge eating disorder. I’m not really should what I should do. I advised her to go to her doctor and make an appointment or speak with her psychiatrist but she didn’t really say much but continued on about her suspicions. Any tips to support her or comfort her ? I’m not really sure what to say and I wouldn’t want to say the wrong thing.,BobJ48,"Tue,03/17/2020-3:08pm","It sounds like she is concerned alright.   BED is when people eat lots of food, but never do anything to offset the calories, so the outcome is often a big weight gain.   To be frank, if your GF has anorexia, large weight gains would be her greatest psychological fear.So does it seem like she is actually gaining weight ?  And uncontrollably stuffing herself with food ?Sometimes people with anorexia honestly do lose their ability to rationally assess how much they are eating.  If people are eating very little, eating anything close to a normal amount may seem like a horrible binge to them.  If that's the case, and she's still not really eating that much, we can find ourselves thinking that they are making a big deal out of nothing.But  rather than trying to reassure her that she's not eating as much as she thinks, I think it's her anxiety that you'll want to pay attention to. Because it really does sound like she's anxious.If you were to ask her what she was anxious about, it's likely she would say ""getting fat"".   But ""getting fat"" is generally code-talk for other deeper sorts of feelings.  A fear of losing control over their lives, a fear of being inadequate as a person, an overall fear of ""Not being good enough"".  So if she's willing to talk, it's those psychological fears and feelings that which you'll want to try and turn the conversation to, rather than going with fat-talk and food and eating. As far as ""saying the wrong thing"" is concerned, when it comes to EDs, almost by definition it's pretty hard not to say the wrong thing.  The person is likely to interpret anything you say as meaning that you think they are fat.   Not always of course, but you'll want to do everything you can to not be lured into making comments about her appearance.  You may have had experience with her trying to do that ?  She'll make some comment about being fat, and then you'll be tempted to respond with something along the lines of ""No you aren't"".   Which is, of course, you just trying to make her feel better, when what you really think is...that she's fat.  In any case, try not to get sucked into those kinds of conversations. Because in lots of cases there's little you can say that will be interpreted correctly. So if it were me, I'd go with the idea that she's anxious. Because I think that's really what she's trying to tell you.And no need to say ""Everything will be fine"" because it might not be.  Mostly I'd just agree that feelings like that must be rough to deal with.Which really does show that you get it.  And that's really what people want mostly : To be understood.
