0,10/06/2021,Howtoapproachandhelpfriend,Jms7985,"Hi there.
I have been friends with this girl for over 10 years and she moved in with a model during COVID.
Ever since she moved in with her new roommate, her eating habits have changed drastically along with her weight. She has had her struggles in the past with body image, but this feels like a lot different and honestly way worse.
She eats all of her food when she’s around me, snacks when i snack, asks for snacks/food, and will announce when she’s hungry, so I can’t assume she’s not eating.. (we are together almost everyday) but when we’ve gone grocery shopping in the past, she would only buy a few types of food. Her fridge is always empty when I’m over, and i never see her eating at home.
Recently she has been showing spiraling and high risk behaviors and blacks out constantly when she drinks. She endured a concussion recently & the doctor advised her to not drink, workout, or work and she did all of the above and pretended she never had one. She works out constantly, and if we eat something “fatty” she will instantly start doing jumping jacks in the living room, run around in circles, or try to go for a walk “to burn calories.” She has an Apple Watch and is obsessed with checking other peoples movements, and “closing out her rings.” We recently took a picture together and that’s when i really realized how tiny she has become as i could really see the bones in her upper body.  Our friends parents are constantly making comments about how skinny she is, and its very uncomfortable and all i want to do is help.. her family has the mentality of entitlement and denial.. so I’m unsure if going to them for help is going to hurt or actually help.
I care about my friend immensely, we have a tight group of girls and we all have noticed her behavior changes along with her incredible weight loss. I have no idea how to approach this situation, I’m doing all the research i can, and I don’t even know where to start or how to help her. She struggles with PTSD, depression, and has had domestic violence in her past.",BobJ48,"Fri,10/15/2021-3:55pm","First off, I'm sorry that your post sat here unanswered for so long.  NEDA has these forums, but for whatever reason, none of their people seem to put much time into helping with them. So it's pretty much whoever shows up from the public to help. In any case, yeah, what a mess.  I think it's safe to say that your friend is in serious trouble.  EDs can really get it's claws into a person, and it sounds that they are into her deep.Plus she's in one of the earliest stages of an eating disorder too.  The part in the beginning where it feels super-rewarding.  Boy oh boy, if a person just works hard enough, is hypervigelent, and applies massive amounts of self-dissipline , look at the amazing things that they can accomplish !!  So yeah, it's all good, right ? Except they aren't hip to  the part about how they're going crazy.  And how their mind is being taken over.  They still have this wonderful feeling of control, whereas what's really happening is that their ED is controlling them.   But when they are in this early stage, it's hard for them to see any of that.   It's true that other people might be  showing concern, but those other people…they  just don't get it about how great it all is. The next stage may be the ""Uh oh, maybe I am in trouble"" stage, but it sounds like she hasn't reached that stage yet.  Because yes, the  whole thing can start getting emotionally darker for the person, once the reality of their situation starts to sink in. What anyone can do, it's hard to say.  One thing that people with EDs frequently do is to begin to withdraw from their friends, and start withdrawing from the world and it's activities  just in general, as their ED thoughts start to become  all that their brain can think about.  As her friend, you may be in a position to help with seeing that that doesn't happen.   Like keep in touch with her, make sure she shows up if you invite her out to things, and do whatever you can to keep her engaged in the every-day world. The PTSD, depression, and abuse issues may start to get worse as well.  Sometimes people use the mental distraction of EDs to try and keep those concerns at bay, but as things begin to play out further and further, those old issues usually start to come out again. "" I know that things may be kind of rough for you now""…saying something as simple as that to her might be more helpful than you might think. Otherwise, yeah ; don't let her start pushing you or her other friends away.  EDs can turn into a pretty lonely thing, and you can help by seeing what you can do to not allow that to happen.",,,,,,,,,
1,08/12/2021,Idon'tknowhowtotalktomyfriendabouthisanorexia,Satine,"Um I just signed up on this website to do a forum and don't quite know how to really start in on this but I'm going to give it a try. So a guy in close to and recently dated at one point briefly brought up how he is anorexic. He doesn't share these personal things or topics with me often if at all (it's usually because I have to push him to tell me when I notice somethings wrong).  And I don't think he has really told anyone else about how he is anorexic. I'm just figuring out and researching anorexia but I don't know how to help him. He has had a troubled past with a lot of trauma and he doesn't seem depressed per se and would never self harm or harm anyone around him. However he very much has a mindset of ""if I get help from someone then I am weak and I must be strong"". So I don't know how to help or talk with him on the matter of his anorexia among other things if he doesn't want help. He has a lot of stress in his life right now too with school and the fact that his mom might have cancer so he will need to help pay bills for it. He also isn't big on talking about himself or personal things unless you push him and even then he doesn't always open up. Aside from that I realized that he smokes Marijuana as a form of self medicating his trauma especially so he can get through his day and night. But I've read that it can be the cause of not eating or not getting good sleep, is that true? And if so would it be safe for him to stop using Marijuana when he uses it as a crutch? And is there any reccomendations on how to help him without him feeling like he is weak? I really care about him and want to help, I know he also wouldn't be okay or feel comfortable talking to a therapist or professional about it nor do I know how serious his anorexia is yet.",BobJ48,"Thu,08/12/2021-10:07pm","Yep, the worries about ""being weak"" can be a concern alright.  Particulary for guys.  They can have a lot of fears around that, it's true.But…what about facing our fears ?  And going ahead and doing the thing that we fear ?  Is it a weak person who does that, or a strong one ?He also may fear that he did get help…things would still turn out to be impossible. That it wouldn't help or make any difference, and then what would he do ?So yeah, people have to take risks sometimes.  Which is another theme you might use.  Strong men are willing to take risks, it's a thing they are know for.  So that's a point you could make too.Even so, you won't want to seem like you are being coercive.  These are just some things to think about. Things which he may already be thinking about, you know ? Folks with EDs can feel alone with their thoughts, so having someone who understands these things can be helpful too.Anyhow, just some thoughts.  Keep in touch if it seems to help ?",,,,,,,,,
2,07/25/2021,Helpingafriendfiguringoutifhehasaneatingdisorder,Aconcernedfriend,"My friend (male 20) thinks he has an eating disorder. I am not sure it is one but I would like to help him as much as possible. He has said that he hasn’t felt like eating “because it is not fun” for a few weeks now. Today he texted me that he was trying to eat and after a few bites he felt like he was going to throw up so he had to stop eating. He said the taste had made him feel that way and it has been happening for over a week. This current meal he was actually excited about which hasn’t happened in a while so now he is concerned.
He is a bigger guy even for his height so he’s always eaten a lot but his intake has diminished because of his lack of wanting to eat. Is this why he feels gross when eating?
Is this an eating disorder and if it is how can I help him to make sure he is eating and taking care of himself?",,,,,,,,,,,,
3,03/28/2021,ShouldIInformHerParents?,ananonymousfriend,"Okay, I'll try to keep this brief. So, recently I noticed that my best friend was starting to get thinner. In hindsight, I hate that I commented on it to begin with, since that probably just fueled her determination to harm herself. But, I digress. I asked her what she was doing, and she seemed kind of hesitant to answer at first. Then she said that she was just cutting out snacks. In my mind, I just figured that she was cutting back on overeating, which I thought was a good, healthy step. Fast forward, and then I realized she wasn't bringing lunch to school (she packs), and then I realized I couldn't remember the last time she brought lunch to school. I know she doesn't eat breakfast, so now without eating lunch, I put two and two together and realized her method of getting 'healthy' is by forcing herself to not eat.
I tried talking to her about it recently and sat her down and addressed the situation. Her response was that she was fine and I was overanalyzing the situation. I even asked her what she had been eating recently, and she refused to tell me when the last time she had a full meal was. Her excuse is that she's not hungry. So then I packed her lunch for school and gave it to her (I said she left it in my car so no one would think I actually made her lunch). I don't know if she ate it or not, because I found out that she likes to lie to me so I won't worry.
I told her that if she doesn't talk to her parents about getting help that I will. However, I think she lied to me about actually doing that. I know I'm not a doctor, but what she's doing is all in line with an eating disorder. Especially since the two times we hung out with our other friends, she was fine until food was placed in front of her. Her hands would shake as she held the food in her hands and she looked really withdrawn and ill.
Now, her cousin just died from COVID and I don't know if it would be inappropriate to reach out to her mom and tell her that she isn't eating. Her mom's been praising her appearance lately too, which, to me, demonstrates that she didn't actually tell her mom what she's been doing. I mean, what parent would comment that after finding out their child hasn't been eating? I don't know what to do. Any advice would be much appreciated.",BobJ48,"Mon,03/29/2021-3:35am","Oh brother, it's hard to say about this. Because it sounds like you are right in your suspicions.  There are certainly those who will tell you that it's your responsibility to tell on her, and they may have a point. But ""the responsibilities of friendship"" can be pretty tangled sometimes. Combine that with the fact that it's possible that her parents would not believe you. Like how no one wants there to be ""a problem"" you know ?  It's can be pretty amazing sometimes, how people don't see things which are right in front of their eyes.
Just a suggestion, but  you might want to talk to the counselor at school about this, and see what she has to say ?  If it comes down to telling her parents, she might be the most effective person to do that ?",,,,,,,,,
4,02/26/2021,CanIGetSomeAdvice,shawn7851,"So I met this girl online and after a little while of talking to her she admitted to having an eating disorder to me, this is something new for me and while I did my best to support her as much as possible until the other day when I made a huge mistake, I did not know that her situation was currently as bad as it was in the past. But as we were talking she went to go eat breakfast and when she came back all she had was some nuts, later on in the day she was hungry so naturally I told her it was okay to go get some food, she refused and then insisted she wasn't hungry anymore, and then I said one of the worst things possible, I said ""the nuts didn't fill you up."" I realize I made a huge mistake and owned up to this and now after talking to her for about 8 months she wants nothing to do with me. For her this is a big deal because she's had negative comments from her friends and family before and I knew that. Is there anything I can do to help fix the situation or support her going forward. I feel terrible and I always had the best intentions but something I said as a joke ruined everything and I didn't even think about her eating disorder when I made this comment. If I had just thought about what I said before I said it, I wouldn't be in this situation. But I can't take back what I said and I own up to my actions. I just would like some advice if anybody has been in a situation like this or if you've been a victim of negative comments.",_admin_moderator,"Sat,02/27/2021-10:22am","Hi shawn7851, Welcome to the forums.

For some reason, sometimes it seems to take a while for notes to get posted. )"" I said ""the nuts didn't fill you up."" I realize I made a huge mistake and owned up to this and now after talking to her for about 8 months she wants nothing to do with me. ""This has got to be a bummer I know, but really, after 8 months of being friends with her, that should all go down the drain because you mentioned some nuts ?  I know it may have been the wrong thing to say, but when you think about it, friendships should be more resilient than that. Plus she should know you well enough by now to understand that you only said it out of care and concern. But this can be the way with eating disorders though.  People who are right in the thick of it can get really edgy, and find that they have become sensitive to the slightest of things.  Out of consideration we should try and be sensitive to this in a general way, but at the same time, we shouldn't have to find ourselves having to walk on eggshells all the time.  Our level of care for the person should count for something I think, and that's something that she should realize as well. So yeah, maybe it's all just bad business.  I'm not sure that we should be required to twist ourselves into mental knots, simply to be friends with someone.  Granted the person may not be responsible for the situation that they find themselves in, and the effects that it has on them,  but at the same time they still kind of need to live in the real world, just like the rest of us do. If it were me, I'd hold off on the apologies, and recommend keeping it really simple if you write to her about this: ""I know what I said may have upset you, but I hope you can trust in my good intentions and the friendship we've shared.""Which is kind of it in a nutshell, you know ?",,,,,,
5,12/08/2020,WorriedBestFriend,eeel123,"Hi there,
I've been growing increasingly nervous around one of my best friends. Over the summer I had noticed her losing some weight, and exercising more, which I thought was her just trying to get healthier at first, but recently, it's become noticeably much. Another friend came up to me as well and asked if she was alright. I guess because I'm around her so often it wasn't exactly clear how thin she had become until I had taken a step back and really looked at her. Recently she started an instagram page that was all about food, and I saw her in our free time scrolling through pages of meals, which I didn't think was weird until I realized that I never really see her eat much of the meals that she makes. This was around the same time she started to get quite thin as well. When we go out to eat, or she comes over for a long period of time, I will rarely see her eat, she never says she's hungry, and she will always reject food when I offer her some unless it's a set lunch or dinner that she has previously agreed to. She used to get excited over food and other activities, but has grown quiet and reserved, and maybe just less enthusiastic overall and now I am mainly the one to initiate meals. I have been friends with her for nearly 10 years, and am wondering if I should just ask her if she is alright and make sure to clarify to her why I am asking? You'd think I'd be more comfortable checking in on such a close friend but I am really scared, because I just want to help her more than anything and I guess I am asking for confirmation that I should at least try.",BobJ48,"Thu,12/10/2020-5:54pm","I think you have every right to be concerned.  While no one is a doctor here, the behaviors you've noticed…they really are the sorts of things someone with an eating disorder would do.  The apparent anxiety around eating, while simultaneously looking at al sorts of ""food porn"", along with what you said about her mood becoming more quiet and less engaged.It's normal to be concerned, and wonder what's going on in situations like this.  To my mind, it falls under the category of ""obligations of friendship"", if you know what I mean ?  One other thing to keep in mind is just how alone with their concerns people with eating disorders can often feel.   Of course it's possible that she's still in the ""denial"" phase of her ED, where she still believes that everything is fine, but from what you've said, she may also be in the ""Uh oh"" phase too, where she's becoming aware of how much power these ""habits"" are starting to exert over her, and over what would otherwise be the normal course of her life. So if it were me, rather than confronting her face-to-face (which can often be terrifically awkward and unrewarding) think about writing her a letter ?  Something she can read in her own good time, and have time to think about, you know ?   And have time to consider how she'd like to respond as well. Also keep this in mind - Not everyone would be willing to step up like you are doing.  While it may create some tension, you've also taken a chance of your own for her.  And she may understand that that in itself counts for something.In any case, it can be quiet here at times, but I hope you see this reply.  And that if there are developments, you'll feel OK about posting.",,,,,,,,,
6,11/29/2020,concernedaboutnewfriend,canshecicero,"Hello, a little background info: I'm 21F and struggled with anorexia when I was a teenager. To cut the story short: I think this girl at my uni I just met this semester (oct 2020) is seriously struggling with an eating disorder, but I don't think i know her well or long enough to do anything.So a few things that raised my suspicions - starting off with the visual aspects, it is pretty clear that she has a ""low bmi"". Also she wears baggy clothes  - we study in the medical field, so we had to take each other's blood pressure and hers was exceptionally low - due to the pandemic we're not allowed to eat on campus, so I can't really tell you anything about her eating behavior, but I visited her dorm once (when she insisted on walking there instead of taking the subway) and food-wise there wasn't much to see. Of course this could be an innocent typical college dorm but I don't know honestly - likes a lot of ""physical"" posts on social media, being bodies or specific body parts like legs etc. (could be seen as th*nspo?) - Lastly, we had a lot of group assignments and we always work together. For our last assignment she didn't really do anything so I asked her if she was okay and she told me she had some personal issues. I told her she could talk to me and she thanked me and told me that she would soon. I really want to help her, but I have no idea how to approach her. As I mentioned before, I have struggled with eating disorders myself and I'm still recovering, and from what I remember i did NOT like to talk about it at all. Anyone know how to help?",BobJ48,"Tue,12/08/2020-4:31pm","Hey there.   Sorry your post sat here for a while, but hopefully you'll get a chance to see this.Standard disclaimer : ""None of us are doctors"" and etc.  Having said that, I'm pretty sure that you can trust your instincts about your friend, and what her issues might be.   So yeah. And exactly like you said yourself - "".. and from what I remember i did NOT like to talk about it at all. ""   Which is a legitimate issue.  I work on some other message boards for people with EDs, and people often talk about seeing other people they know who have them too, and how it's really hard to come out and say anything face-to-face, even though both people are probably well-aware of what the issue is . So….you might want to write her a note or a letter, and mention that you understand what she might be up against, tell her a little about your own situation.  And then see what comes of that ?Because you know how it can be, I'm sure - people can feel awfully alone with their situation sometimes, and just knowing that someone else understands can make quite a difference itself.",,,,,,,,,

It can be pretty quiet here at times, but sooner or later you are likely to get a reply.And yes, what shall we do when we know that people we care for may be involved in unhealthy habits ?  Because I suspect that your suspicions about your friend may be accurate.  Plus what about situations that are going to be difficult for the person to resolve, even in the best of times ?   Once they spill the beans to us…are they then going to think that we expect them to recover ?  Because really, that is pretty much what we're going to hope for them.If it were me…I'd wait until she seems ready to talk about it.  EDs can be awfully private, and sources of shame for some people.  If she wasn't doing anything to help herself that would be one thing.  But since she's seeing a therapist, it seems to me that she's already taking a responsible approach.One thing you might want to watch out for though - If it seems that she has low self-esteem, or tends to get down on herself, I do think you can be supportive in that way.

11,07/24/2020,Concernedaboutsomepeople-adviceonhowtohelp,the_winds_of_wi...,"I've noticed that over lockdown (and some time before) a few people I know have become increasingly obsessed with their body image, food intake etc. and I have no idea how to help as a friend. I'm speaking regularly with a couple of them and have praised them for opening up to me about it and encouraged them to seek professional help. Both their parents are also less than supportive - they actually encourage their behaviour- so I'm not sure whether they will be able to get any help at all. I don't want to trigger or offend them in any way so sometimes I don't know what to say.  I know from experience the 'just eat' type of comments really don't make anyone feel better so I've avoided things like that. The person I'm most concerned about though is someone i don't actually know all that well. We used to go to the same school but they left for uni this year so I won't be able to see them. I could tell they were struggling before hand but was never able to speak to them due to lesson timetabling and us being in different year groups. I have found out they are still struggling now from social media posts (not theirs) but I have no way of reaching them easily. I just really want to help them because everyone deserves to be happy. Apart from professional help, what is the best thing I can do?",BobJ48,"Sun,07/26/2020-7:57pm","Dear Winds,I've been in your position before, and am in the same position today, with some people I know on an eating disorder forum. I've been involved in this sort of thing for years now, so like yourself, I've had to try and figure out how to be supportive in ways that hopefully make some kind of difference.And what I've come to understand is that there are limits on what we can achieve.  This can seem like a bummer at first - We'd like to be able to *somehow* head them off in the direction of recovery, but what I've found is that that's a decision that they have to make for themselves.  Which…sounds obvious I know, but even so, deciding to get help, or even deciding that recovery is what they want, that in itself can be a long and twisting journey.So as a friend, you can't lose your patience with that, or allow it to discourage you. I think the best thing you can do is to try and put yourself in their shoes, and try and understand the issues that they are struggling with.  Things like depression, self-hate, low self-esteem, frustrations they have about their ""failures"" as a human being because somehow the weight is not comping off fast enough.  And just in general their worries about not being ""good enough"". Which…a lot of this has nothing at all to do with food or eating.  It's kind of deeper than that, if you know what I mean.And yes, you're going to be limited by what stage of their ED they are in, and ""what they can and cannot hear""…if you follow me?People with EDs can feel shut off and disconnected from the world too.  So talking about regular day-to-day things can help too, in that these are things which are *not* their ED, which is often all that they can think about during the day. In any case, as far as ""fixing"" goes, that's not something we can really do.  But if we can be someone who they feel safe to talk to, that can be of help I think, as they try and navigate their way through the mental maze of EDs.Anyhow, just some thoughts.   Keep writing ?Bob J.",,,,,,,,,
12,07/13/2020,AdviceForFriend,Lucysky,"Hi,I have a friend that is interested in getting help but is scared to ask for it. She told me she went to a doctor’s appointment to look into a possible heath issue that was bothering her. She got blood work done too. All came back normal. She did get the courage to tell her doctor she dealt with restriction//bulimia in her past as she feared this may be related to her possible issue. The doctor had just responded with “did you do it everyday?”  She mentioned to her doctor she did.  The conversation had ended at that point.  She was unable to tell the full details of her past history as well as say she went back into it this past year and was too scared to ask for help now. What would be the best way for her to ask for help/ get help? I talked to her but she is still too scared to ask. She thinks because she is not underweight and her results were fine she won’t be taken seriously.  She feels embarrassed to book another appointment because her last appointment had ended with everything was dealt with. Her doctor did recommend she book an appointment with a nutritionist as a last resort with her health issue because everything came back normal. She did tell me she was going to book an appointment with a nutritionist but wasn’t sure if she should share her history with the nutritionist, both past and present or would even have the courage to do this.  Do you think she should try to start to share this with the nutritionist? I am proud of my friend for at least talking to me and want to help her anyway I can. I greatly appreciate any advice regarding this.Lucy",_admin_moderator,"Mon,07/13/2020-10:05pm","Hi Lucy, we’re so glad you’re here.

Recovery is possible!",BobJ48,"Wed,07/15/2020-3:20am","I'm sorry she had such  poor results when she tried to talk to the doctor the first time.  You'd think that doctors would know more about things like this, so it can be a shock and a disappointment when they don't.  And probably no surprise that she'd be wary of trying again. ""She thinks because she is not underweight and her results were fine she won’t be taken seriously.""This is a really common concern for people with EDs. And often they will feel that until they've starved themselves to the point of being frightenly thin, they don't actually deserve to get help. Which can lead to them just restricting more.  Rather than getting help now and avoiding all that. ""She did tell me she was going to book an appointment with a nutritionist but wasn’t sure if she should share her history with the nutritionist...Do you think she should try to start to share this with the nutritionist ?Yes, definitely.  Sometimes I think nutritionists might be more aware about eating disorders than doctors are. That's not certain of course, but they've probably seen more people with EDs than most doctors have.  Plus if the nutritionist is going to make up a meal plan for her, the fact that she's struggling with an ED is something the nutritionist would want to take into consideration when making that plan.  Plus I don't think a nutritionist would be shocked about hearing about people's EDs at all, so there's a good chance she'll receive a sympathetic response.As the person from NEDA said, if she's actually considering getting help, she might want to call the helpline and see what they have to say about the practical matters that might be involved.  And so that hopefully she could avoid the poor experiences she had before.""I am proud of my friend for at least talking to me… ""Yes, people can really feel alone with things like this, and may have had bad experiences trying to talk to others about it. So, yes, it was brave of her to be able to talk to you.  And I suspect it means that you are a good sort of person yourself.",,,,,,
13,06/01/2020,Myfriendkeepsmakingexcusesinsteadofgettinghelp,emarsh,My best friend has been struggling with an eating disorder for many years and this past year it has gotten so bad that she is frequently in the hospital with severe life threatening issues with problems caused by it. She trusts me enough to talk to me about her problems and I listen and help her however I can. I tried talking to the doctors at the hospital about helping her but they couldn’t do anything on my word alone apparently. I am very worried I could lose her. I’ve talked with her parents and I’ve tried talking with her doctors but they cannot force her to get help. She is scared to get help and keeps making excuses not to see a doctor or a therapist. I’m not sure what I can do but I do not want to be helpless.,BobJ48,"Wed,06/03/2020-2:07am","Boy, this is a difficult position to be in, but I think a lot of other people are in your shoes.  Our friend feels safe enough to confide in us, which really does feel like an intimate honor, but when it comes to us actually being able to ""do something"" to materially effect their situation, it all seems out of our hands. Which in many senses it is.  Because when it comes to recovery, EDs are such a personal thing that if the other person isn't into it, then there's really not much we can do.  Or so it seems. You mentioned this though :""She is scared to get help and keeps making excuses not to see a doctor or a therapist.""So has she told you what she is scared about yet ?  People can worry that professionals will want them to recover.  Which isn't so surprising, really.  Your friend may have some part of herself that wants to recover too.  So one thing she might be frightened of is…that maybe she won't be able to recover, even if she wants to.  So if she did try and recover, she'd just end up being a big disappointment to everyone. Which would be something to be afraid of it's true.Or she may see her ED as the only sort of coping method that she has.  And what would she have to turn to if she did give it up ?  People can be frightened about that too.So they're going to have to be willing to take some risks.  Because it's true, things might not work out.  But they will never know until they take the risk to find out. In any case, that's something you might be able to talk to her about.  What she's afraid of ( ""getting fat"" doesn't count as an answer! ), and if she's OK with those fears holding her back.   And then the idea of being willing to take some risks or not.  For yourself, being able to let go of the idea that there's some magic thing you can do to cure them…that's something I'd try and get used too.  ""Love is all you need"" doesn't seem to work either.  But if you can help the person get a better perspective on things simply by talking with you, then that can make a difference I think.  ""Support"" rather than ""fixing"", if you know what I mean ?Whatever the case, the idea that she has someone she can talk to, versus the idea of having no one at all…you are helping out already I think, even if you're not seeing a whole lot of changes. So have faith in that if you can ?",,,,,,,,,
14,05/13/2020,HowdoIhelpsomeone,Glacialan,"I am currently in an awkward position and really need some help and guidance.
I want the best for my friend and want to really try to help her. But I have no experience helping someone with an eating disorder. I really don't know where to begin. The situation:
My friend is 14 and is struggling with self-diagnosed body dysmorphia. She spends a lot of her nights throwing up and crying over her body and her looks. For days at a time, she'll go without eating to try and ""balance"" herself after eating. She wants to eat healthily and tries to sometimes but her family struggles financially. Since she can't eat decent meals, she makes up for it by working out. She'll go for walks or play sports but, she does it extensively and rather excessive. She can't afford to seek professional help and because so she allows her health to decline. I'm worried about her health longterm and I really don't think her carrying on now will do too well after a long period of time. What I've Been Doing:
I myself deal with mental illness and have tried my best to comfort her in the ways that I know. I've tried talking to her about it and trying to point her in the right direction. I've tried to help her stick to somewhat of a work out routine and have attempted to get her to eat better foods. I really don't know if what I'm doing has any weight. But I want to try anyway and help her in anyway I can.I need suggestions and recommendations for what I can do.
Is there anywhere I can go to help her meet with a professional?
Are there certain ways I could go about nudging her in a good direction?
Have I gone about this entirely wrong??I really need some guidance here, anything and everything helps.",iwanttolive,"Sat,05/16/2020-11:38pm","Hi and welcome to the forum. It is so kind of you to reach out to try to find help for your friend. I know it is scary to see what is happening with friend. I can only give you my opinion as we can't give medical advice. As she is so young and the reality that eating disorders are dangerous and life threatening, I would try seeing if you can talk with who you trust or even her parents.  This may cause your friend to become angry but from what you are describing, your friend needs help now.  If she does get angry, the face t that you are helping her get help since she is unable to do so is actually the bravest thing you could do for her.  She will probably come around and thank you but right now the important thing is for your friend to get help. NEDA has information on programs or hospitals or therapists that will give her family some ideas about what to do.  I know you care about your friend but I think you are realizing she needs more help than you are able to provide. I also think that with your own issues you need to make sure you are not jeopardizing your own health. So this was long but I needed to stress that this illness can  be fatal. I urge you to reach out to someone or her parents and get her help Please let me know what happens.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,
15,04/04/2020,MultipleFriendswithE.Ds,howareyou,"Hi! Two of my best friends have eating disorders, one of them going to the doctors for it. I have done my research & I know the signs & indicators. Whenever me & my two best friends ever converse, whether that be in real life, or on text, little signs of insecurity & unsure-ness shines though in their sentences to each other and me. whenever this happens, I never know what to say other than denying it, & when I do this, it feels like it does nothing. So what I'm asking for advice on is: what could I say or do that could actually be useful in situations like this, especially because I have not been though or supported somebody with an eating disorder?",BobJ48,"Wed,04/08/2020-3:48pm","First off, I'm sorry your post sat here for a while unanswered.  It's kind of how things are on this forum : Sometimes you'll need to wait a few days for a reply.In any case, as you are seeing,  it really can be difficult to ""say the right thing"" in situations like this.  Plus EDs are quite private things, to the point where even your two friends may have difficulty discussing it with each other.  So I hope you won't think that somehow there's some set of magic words you can say that will serve to make things all better again. But understanding the sorts of internal thoughts they are fighting against can help.  People with EDs often struggle with the ""good enough"" thing.  No matter their accomplishments, somehow they are never quite good enough as human beings.  There's often a lot of self-hate too, which can lead to feelings of unworthiness.   Plus they often are dealing with control issues too : Like they always have to stay vigilant, and exercise self-control.  ""Loosening up"" can feel like a dangerous thing.So if you understand the sorts of inner messages that their ED is feeding them, that can help a little I think. Personally, I'm not sure that telling people that everything's going to be fine, or that they really should not worry about these things helps much.  They feel how they feel, and that's pretty much it.  But at the same time, it's no fun for them to have these sorts of feelings, and if you can show that you understand that part, then that can help a little I think.Because people like to feel understood, you know ?  Or to at least feel that others are trying to understand them.  And if you can keep that in mind when you are talking with your friends, then that's something that can feel supportive I think.Anyhow, hope you see this, and that it helps just a little.",,,,,,,,,
16,03/11/2020,Howtoguidefriendsinsupport?,lostatsea,"I'm currently fighting for recovery, and have been gradually opening up to one of my best friends, with a changing dynamic between us (we both like each other more than friends). He can be a little cold when I talk about my ED and my negative thoughts. He's the sort of person who doesn't like to beat around the bush and be straight to the point, but I receive it as cold-hearted and unsympathetic a lot of the time. I want to help him understand what I need to best support me, but I'm not sure exactly what to tell him. I also really want to open up to my friends more, but it just feels like they can't understand. Is there anyone that can give advice or talk about their experience? I'm still trying to navigate what it takes to recover and how to change almost a lifetime of self-negativity. Anything you can do to help me help my friends to better understand would be greatly appreciated.",BobJ48,"Mon,03/16/2020-5:29pm","Hey Lost,You know, I think it's really hard for people without experience to understand EDs.  You can see why they might think it's about weight and food and eating and appearance and such.  That's pretty much what it seems like from the outside, so it's hard to blame them for not understanding. Add to that the fact that generally friends do want to help, and you can see why their help doesn't always feel like help. Like with this fellow for example.  The reason he may see cold is because he's not really getting it, and thinks that it should be more simple than you're trying to make it ?  But at the same time is made uncomfortable by the thought that he might not understand. So while it would be best if they understood more, I'm not sure that it should be your personal job to educate them.  That's just my opinion of course; but often things are just too close to the bone, I think ?.  But it would be good if they educated themselves, you know ?  And maybe you could help them with that.   If there's some good books you know, or resources online you could direct them to that would help them to get it,  I think that that's probably the best way to go about it. Also, if they do express a desire to help, be prepared ahead of time to tell them what would feel helpful to you. You don't want to find yourself ad-libbing when they ask, if you know what I mean  ?When it comes to opening up to friends, you'll want to pick and choose who you tell, I think. Some people will honor the fact that you told them, while others may not.  And those who don't may end up responding in ways that are triggering. So you'll want to be selective I think ?In any case, just some thoughts.    Keep writing ?",,,,,,,,,
