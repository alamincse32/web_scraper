0,03/14/2021,Didbulimiaplayabigroleinmybreakup?,"I started dating a woman three months ago. I'm in my mid-30s, she's in her mid-20s. It went exceptionally well - I'm not sure I've ever clicked with anyone quite as well in my whole life. Smart, funny, just full of energy and enthusiasm. Things went super fast, we spent a huge percentage of our time together. I was smitten on day one and more smitten every day since.I figured out pretty fast she was bulimic, basically by overhearing the purges. She admitted as much a little after, although she never really talked about it at length. She'd drop a depressed ""I can't keep anything down today"" in a text, or occasionally a ""I haven't thrown up in a week!"" but it didn't seem like questions were particularly welcome, and they generally went unanswered anyway. I tried to be supportive in a broad way, while not making comments about food or her appearance other than to say she was beautiful (not hard, it's true). She said the bulimia was recent development, about five months old now, and that I was the only person who knew. (I think she only used the word ""bulimia"" once, come to think of it.) The impression, to me, was that this was a bad thing, but maybe not the end of the world? In retrospect that was a pretty silly thing to think, with her throwing up multiple times a day! One strange thing about our speedy romance was that the rush forward was punctuated by occasional comments from her about too much commitment. She'd say she was falling in love with me, that I was the nicest man she ever met, but then she'd say she wanted to slow down, or that she was afraid she'd turn toxic and hurt me, or she was worried we weren't compatible. We were never, technically, exclusively dating, although she told me that she'd ""withdraw so fast"" if I went out with anyone else. I'm generally easygoing about these things, and she was very recently single before we started dating, so I chalked it up to her wanting to just ease into things or having some lingering insecurities, which seems normal enough.At one point about a month in she actually dumped me out of the blue. I said something that rather inexplicably frustrated her (I mentioned her recent breakup to a friend, which she told me was very private). The next day I received a bizarre text, almost written like a job rejection letter, saying it was nice to know me but she didn't think it was going to work out. I was shocked. She came over and we had a long talk. The main thing I remember from that was her flat, almost irritated affect, while I was very emotional and teary and confused. I couldn't understand where the energetic, expressive person I cared about had gone. Eventually she said she wanted to go slower (this seems to be have been the real issue all along) and things pretty much went back to normal. In fact, nothing seemed to slow down at all - she seemed more excited about the relationship than ever.Fast-forward to two weeks ago. Suddenly she begins not really responding to my texts or calls. I've dated enough people to know SOMETHING is up, although I can't really say what. I'm starting to get paranoid. We aren't seeing each other quite as much, and she's not staying over very often. Being an idiot, I start to worry she met someone else she likes more - remember, we're technically not exclusive. A week ago she says she wants to slow down, and makes a few comments that vaguely suggest she is dating other people. I get very upset - not mad, but emotional, very sad, very confused. For the record, I feel terribly guilty for expressing such intense emotions, I think in retrospect it was the exact wrong approach. But I didn't understand why she'd withdrawn so quickly and I became worried maybe the feelings she'd expressed weren't real, and I'd been played for a fool somehow. Over several days of emotional conversations - well, emotional on my part, she never indicated much emotion at all at this point - I make the huge stupid mistake of asking her outright if she's been using me. She's very upset by this and wants to end things. So she does. She picks up her stuff and we have a long conversation, which pretty much goes the way of the rest - me very upset and confused, trying to explain how much I care about her and how baffled I am, and her, again very flat, talking about how she's disappointed in me (""not mad,"" she says) and wishes me the best. She tells me she doesn't owe anyone honesty - not me, not her friends, no one. She says we're not compatible and I'm just a lonely person who needs company, who needs to deal with my insecurities. I know I'm not perfect, but I swear, it felt so much like she was LOOKING for things to blame me for, and had no interest in working past them once she found them. It felt like she was looking for any door out she could find. The phrase I kept using with friends afterwards was ""like someone flipped a switch"" - the loving, wonderful woman I knew just deleted. She argues with me about gifts I've given her. I want her to take them, she doesn't want to ""owe"" me anything. Then she leaves.Naturally I was devastated, confused, and despairing - I feel like I've inexplicably screwed up the best relationship of my life. It at no point occurred to me at all that any of this might have anything to do with her eating disorder. Then I had a conversation with a friend who had struggled with similar issues, and she said: ""I was pretty sure this was going to happen eventually."" I googled it, found this forum, and found post after post describing bizarrely similar breakups and conflicts. Okay, apologies for the long, long story. Here are my questions:
-Am I crazy for suddenly thinking that a lot of the inexplicable stuff in our relationship, and maybe even the breakup almost in its totality, was the result of her bulimia? I know there's a danger here because I am very sad, and searching for any explanation, and this is one that lets me off the hook while even getting to believe that she really meant all the nice things she said. And during the relationship I never ascribed that much importance to the eating disorder, which felt like a separate, private thing of hers (albeit one I privately hoped very much she could address). But the pattern is so similar to the other stories here!-Reading this forum has also made me very worried about the safety of my ex. She's moving into a new place by herself in a few days (something that was already causing her a lot of stress) and she's estranged from her family (for good reasons). I don't think she talks about any of this with her friends. She has some preexisting mental health issues on top of the eating disorder, and I worry that this move will just make it easier to avoid seeking any help. Is there anything at all I can do? Even if things between us are done, I want her to be safe, happy, and healthy, and most of all, to see some kind of professional. I worry she is isolating herself. -Do people who have experienced similar things have any guess about what happens next? Is she going to ghost completely (I asked her this and she said ""I don't know, I can't predict the future"")? Or is the desire to pull back something that comes and goes and waves? I know there's nothing I can do about it either way, but I guess I'm curious, as a person whose mental energies are currently heavily occupied by this.","""I googled it, found this forum, and found post after post describing bizarrely similar breakups and conflicts.""Yes, how about that ?  I've worked here for about 7 years, and on another site for 10 years before that, and you really do hear this same story over and over.  The authentically wonderful person, who in a moment of intimacy shares their secret, and rather than the relationship benefiting from the shared closeness, things inexplicably fall apart instead.  And really, what sort of fellows show up on a forum like this ?  Not jerks - it's the good men like yourself.   In fact, it's almost like being a good fellow puts a guy at higher risk for something like this.  Which also often seems to be the case with people who get EDs themselves.  It's often as though being a good person is also a risk factor for having an ED.   So…a lot of things going on underneath the surface I think. "" Am I crazy for suddenly thinking that a lot of the inexplicable stuff in our relationship, and maybe even the breakup almost in its totality, was the result of her bulimia? ""No, I don't think you are crazy for thinking so.  As you said, you hear about this same mysterious pattern over and over.  Everything seems fine and even wonderful, and then once the cat's out of the bag, suddenly it's not. ""-Reading this forum has also made me very worried about the safety of my ex. She's moving into a new place by herself in a few days…""Yes, situations like that can be legitimately worrisome.  Just the person and their ED, alone together.  Some people can hold things together better than other people can, but if she's at a point where sometimes she goes on a binge and purge run that can go on for hours, that's not an encouraging place for a person to find themselves in.
What can you do to help ?  My sense is that it will hinge on what she will allow you to do. Which may be nothing, if she has truly cut you off.  Which can be an awfully helpless feeling, when we feel nothing but authentic good-will towards the person."" -Do people who have experienced similar things have any guess about what happens next? Is she going to ghost completely (I asked her this and she said ""I don't know, I can't predict the future"")? Or is the desire to pull back something that comes and goes and waves? ""You'll just have to be patient I think.  I think you can be certain that she knows that you care about her, so I'm not sure that you need to emphasize that.  Plus she also understands that she's treated you in ways that you don't deserve.  It's pretty likely that she understands that he ED is not a positive thing in her life.  So despite her distancing herself from you, I think you can be sure that she understands all these things.  How she decides to put this all together…well, it's a difficult thing to try and put together, so it may indeed end up being a back and forth sort of thing.  Or not, depending on how frustrated she gets with herself.  So for now, as much as you may hate it, you may need to back off and simply see what sort of openings she presents you with.  If you are OK with that I mean. As a caring person, you don't want to find yourself a slave to her changing emotions.  Because from a ""looking out for our own health too"" standpoint, that should not be your reward for caring, you know ? In any case, if you find yourself being confused, it's because situations like these are truly confusing.  Please try not to blame yourself, or spend too much time worrying about ""if I'd only done this instead of that"".  I think you've done pretty well already.But yeah, eating disorders.  People may think they know something about them, until they find themselves dealing with them in person. They are complicated things, and the ways that both sufferers and loved ones go about navigating the waters is often unpredictable and uncertain.Keep writing ?","Thanks for the reply, Bob - somehow I figured you'd be on top of this. I showed this to my friend who first suggested this was a problem and she and I both agree you're incredibly good at this. I hope you know it's appreciated.It sounds selfish, given the gravity of what she's going through, but some of the toughest stuff here, for me, is knowing what was real and what wasn't. She was so cold and different when she dumped me. I was desperately looking for any sign that, even if her mind was made up, the relationship ending was affecting her too. But there just wasn't any. She erased me with the same kind of vague frustration you might exhibit if you tried to cancel an internet subscription and it was taking too long. I asked about a few things we did - things at the time that seemed to bring her obvious joy - and she said ""That was nice of you!"" or ""That was a nice day, yes."" But she said she'd been caught up in the moment (for months??) and after thinking on it a few days, wasn't interested anymore. She denied remembering some of the things she said to me, most notably that she was falling in love, although she shrugged and said that she might have said them, and was sorry for that. I've been assured that this was the ED talking, almost like a separate entity living inside her, but it's hard to shake the feeling that I fell for a mirage or performance -- or alternatively, that people's feelings are so ephemeral and impermanent that it's effectively the same thing, and so many close and wonderful moments together can just evaporate in a few hours. I know it isn't healthy but I sit around and wonder if she's given me two moments' thought or even remembers much about the relationship, a week later. Which is almost more unsettling than believing I'd been had.","Thanks for the compliment.  Many years ago I had a friend who passed away from her eating disorder (as well as a lot of other issues) so that's how I ended up involved in all this. You wrote :""…. or alternatively, that people's feelings are so ephemeral and impermanent that it's effectively the same thing, and so many close and wonderful moments together can just evaporate in a few hours.""Yes, that part is strange, and I think you are right in assuming it's not the normal way with people. With most people that is. The apparent coldness and the air of detachment I mean.  That's not always the way with eating disorders either.  People can push us away, but even so, usually there are some feelings and emotion that's involved.""I've been assured that this was the ED talking, almost like a separate entity living inside her, but it's hard to shake the feeling that I fell for a mirage or performance.""It's interesting to hear you say that, because some people really do have an unstable ""sense of self"".  They can take up a persona and play it out well, but there's really no consistency to their internal construct.  And you do hear people talk about this.  About how they don't have a reliably stable sense of who they are.  Which can be an unsettling thing for them. So in that sense, the person you knew may have disappeared.  And now she's trying to assemble a new person for herself.  One that doesn't contain the challenges of a complex and caring relationship.Again, this is all complete speculation, but ""sense of self"" issues can be a very real thing for some people.  Borderline Personality Disorder is a diagnosis that has a huge stigma around it, so it's not a term to throw around lightly, but folks who have that can have some real sense-of-self problems.  You mentioned that things took off super-fast between the two of you, which is also something that can happen with folks like that. They can also be prone to black-and-white thinking ; One day you are the greatest guy in the world, and the next day they can't imagine what they ever saw in you. So interpersonal relationships can turn out to be a difficult matter with them.  These folks can often have EDs too. Again, it's probably not fair to speculate, but it's been my experience that if our instincts are telling us that something strange is going on…then it probably is. Anyhow, just some other things to consider in trying to make sense of this.","Resurrecting an older post here, but there are some new developments. I spent a lot of time researching BPD and realized that it was a perfect match with my ex - not just the ED, but the fluid identity, self-harm, fear of abandonment, very strong and changing emotions, were all obviously present, although she did an excellent job of keeping this stuff hidden or downplaying it when I was around. I did quite a lot of reading about BPD. One thing I learned is that after leaving BPD sufferers often come back to old relationships.And that's exactly what happened. Six months after we broke up, almost to the day, she called me and asked to get dinner. On one level, I was shocked - I was still blocked on a lot of social medi and there wasn't any sign of a thaw. On another, I had read so much that I almost expected it. Anyway, long story short, she and I have reconnected some. We still get along extremely well, so well that it's been almost too easy to forget about the six-month absence. She's been more open about her mental health issues, and has received some additional therapy and treatment, although she hasn't mentioned BPD (and I'm not going to mention it before she does). For my part, the reading I've done has helped a lot - there are a lot of strategies for dealing with BPD-style emotional volatility and they've been very successful. Okay, here's the problem: despite all this, the bulimia still seems quite bad. She's told more people about it, including her doctors, therapist, and a number of friends. She has some medication for it. And she seems more comfortable mentioning it to me. But ultimately she still throws up fairly frequently after meals, especially when she's feeling anxious or bad about her life otherwise. In fact, if anything, she seems a little more fatalistic about the situation. Is there anything I can do at this point? I care about this person, and she clearly wants to be part of my life again, at least for now. I know that BPD means she's going to necessarily be more volatile and unpredictable than most people, and any relationship with her is at a higher risk of collapse, but I've arrived at some acceptance of that reality. But the bulimia is different - it's really hard to accept someone who is a significant presence in your life harming herself like this so frequently.","Good to hear from you, and interesting to hear that you read up on BPD.  Not that many people are familiar with the condition, so it's something that you checked it out. And yes, it can ring a lot of bells, and explain a lot of things.Good to hear that your friend seems more comfortable mentioning her issues. As you said, you may not want to bring up BPD unless she does, but it's possible that she has some awareness of it herself.  It used to be felt that people with BPD were unable to have any personal insight into their condition, but I can assure you that that's not the case at all. The stigma around the diagnosis seems to be a little less too, now that the profession has some therapeutic tools to work with.  DBT being the main approach now. But yes, the Bullimia.  Like you've noticed, it can ramp up during times when the person feels there are things happening which they have no control over, or during times of stress just in general.  Plus (yet again) the whole ""good enough"" thing.""I can imagine you must be feeling anxious"" or ""Things really are difficult I know"" where she can trust that you know how she's feeling are probably the best responses.  They don't actually ""fix"" the situation it's true, but people can feel less stressed and less alone if they know that others have an idea of how they are feeling. Also, keep in mind that most people with bulimia are not happy about their condition. Sure, they seek the behavior in order to feel better in the moment, but in the long run they usually hate the idea that they are a slave to the thing. This is probably not a very helpful note I know, but I'm glad that you wrote, and I do hope you'll feel OK about sharing your feelings as matters progress.",,,,,,,

That was back in 2015 I think, and as far as I can tell, nothing else has ever shown up to replace it. This place is the only place I know about now, and you can see how active it is.

2,08/28/2021,Whentopushthepanicbutton?,"Hi Everyone,
I've known my wife for about 20 years and been married for 10. Until February this year she never appeared to have an ED but has since seemingly developed anorexia. I think the trigger was her putting on some weight such that she didn't fit in some old clothes, although she was still within the healthy BMI range. Since then she has plummeted in weight. As far as I can tell she is barely eating and is exercising at least 2 hours a day; likely more due to all her pacing around the house. The positives currently is that she diagnosed herself with a problem and sought help from a professional specialising in eating disorders, which she is seeing in two weeks. She came to me and told me what she was struggling with in about late July.So she seemed on top of things and I tried to support and not interfere but since then her weight keeps dropping. She keeps a log of her weight (which I have read behind her back, I apologise) but it means I know that she is lying to me when I ask how things are going and she says she is recovering and gaining weight whereas I just see the real numbers going down. She is incredibly secretive and doesn't want anyone to know about this which has put me in a difficult position as my parents want to visit but I've had to make excuses since she doesn't want anyone to see how thin she has got. It's difficult hiding all this from my son (9 years old) who I think knows something is up. I hate lying to him so I have to walk a fine line between feeling like I explained things the best I can to him and not causing my wife to become extremely upset. Lately I have become concerned about my wife driving my son places, since I know at her BMI she should could potentially faint - I haven't brought this up with her yet, but I suspect it will cause more upset. In fact, if others can chip on this point explicitly it would help a lot.Each time I raise something of concern she says ""I stress her out which doesn't help her recovery"". Of course I want to help, but I am also growing concerned that there is no recovery and she just wants no one interfering with her ED.I desperately want to respect her wishes and the way she wants to do things. But I'm beginning to feel there must be a point where you hit the panic button where you tell a wider circle of family so they can support and start overriding her; like getting rid of all the exercise machines she has bought. What do I do?Please help.","Hi blusp, welcome to the forums. We’re glad you’re here and are sorry to hear about what’s going on with your wife. We slightly edited your post to remove mentions of BMI numbers, which are not allowed on the forums.

All the lying and hiding that's involved ; that can be one of the symptoms, unfortunately, even for folks who weren't like that before. The up-side is that your wife realizes that she's in trouble, and is willing to get help.   This puts here WAY ahead of a lot of people in her position, so you both have good reasons to feel hopeful about that. ""Each time I raise something of concern she says ""I stress her out which doesn't help her recovery"".Yes, and she's probably telling the truth when she says that.  Try and keep in mind the idea that at their heart, EDs are about a person being in control, which really is what they can seem to be about for the person in the beginning.  All that self-discipline, strict regimentation  and hard work, you know ?  Just the sort of thing that helps us feel in control.  But with time, it begins to dawn on the person that it's just the opposite - that the ED is controlling them instead.  This clash of ideas can be super-unsettling for the person, and when we try and ""be helpful"" it can just stir up those conflicting ideas, and the stress that comes with it even more.   So the person gets stressed, and feels less in control, and since their EDs has become so strongly associated with control for them….maybe you can see what I'm getting at. Their ED can get worse rather than better.  It's an unsettling mental cycle that's almost beyond their control, and like the ""snake eating it's own tail"" thing sometimes. My sense is that what's going to feel supportive to her is if you can seem like you get it about this. Saying things like ""I know it must be difficult to feel like you are not in control""…that's absolutely going to feel like the truth to her.  ""I know it must be hard to feel like eating is the right thing to do"" - there's going to be no disagreement about that either. If she feels like you understand what she's going through, that's what's going to be the most helpful I think.  "" But I'm beginning to feel there must be a point where you hit the panic button where you tell a wider circle of family so they can support and start overriding her; like getting rid of all the exercise machines she has bought.""Again, keep in mind the control thing.  If other people start trying to control her, things are likely to get worse and not better.  Conversely, she'll feel more in control (in a healthy way) if she makes these decisions herself. None of this is going to happen overnight though, so having patience is part of your task as well.But again, the idea that she's willing to get some outside help for herself is a really big deal (  ""I know it must be kind of scary to think about getting help for all this "" )  so I'd wait and see how she responds to therapy before I started involving the rest of the family, which to her is just going to feel like more people who want to control her; an idea of which is unlikely to lead things in a good direction. Anyhow, it's not good to be alone with this sort of thing, so keep posting, OK ?",,,,,,,,,,
3,08/03/2021,GirlfriendwithRestrictiveED,"Hello, I am struggling with supporting my girlfriend. She has a restrictive ED, and it's just been getting worse. She went to an inpatient facility a few years ago, but now is back with her parents. She doesn't want help with her ED and wants to just lose weight.

And thoughts that she's trying to battle against.

Maybe you know what I mean ?So again, I try and put myself in the other person's shoes.  Because what's going to feel supportive to them is if they think that I ""get it"" you know ?  Which, when you think about it, is usually what feels supportive to anyone. no matter what their issue might be.Still it's good that you are asking her what she might feel is supportive.  If her mood is bad, she may say ""Nothing"", but you might want to keep asking if she says that, and see if she can come up with something that might possibly be helpful. .

All day long.   said he wasn't hungry.I have told him I'm worried about his weight and asked him to talk to me about whats going on.  I've said I'm here to talk about anything.  I support him and I love him.  I've told him nothing is too much for me to hear...  But he's in denial.   he doesn't do that cover up thing - he acutally continues to buy smaller clothes and wear small shorts which show his stick legs.  I do not tell him to eat or force him to eat or anything.  We serve ourselves at dinner.  I do try to make things he really really likes though.  I believe he's in total denial - his kids have even mentioned their concerns.  None of us nag but once ina while we might mention it.  People at work have asked if he's OKSo my question for you all is - is there anything I can say to help him see the slippery slope he's on?  that weighing himself 20 times a day shows that he needs help.  I'm even thinking of calling his doctor to have her talk to him.  but that seems invasive.  I just want to help him seek help.  Note, I do know the three Cs - i didn't cause this, I can't control it and I can't cure it.  but perhaps I can help him get help before this gets bad...I'd love your thoughts on how I can support him and how I can help him decide to seek help.","Hi Rose 63!

I think you can be pretty sure that he understands that obsessively weighing himself all throughout the day is not normal.  He probably knows that being controlled by these obsessions is not the sort of thing that's healthy for anyone.For many people with EDs, what finally gets their attention is a growing awareness that they are not in control of their behaviors anymore. This can be a pretty unsettling realization for most people with EDs, no matter how much in denial  they may have been in.  What I mean is, here's this thing that they were doing, to assure themselves about how much control they had over things, but now it's controlling them instead. Things can also reach a point where there's no longer any room in their heads for anything other than their thoughts about eating and food.  At some point people with EDs can begin to worry about that as well.  How that in the past there was a large variety of things they used to enjoy and be able to think about. And how that's no longer the case anymore.I think you are right in feeling that it's probably not your place to point these things out to him, and that to have any effect, these are realizations he may have to come to on his own.  ""Go get therapy"" and all that.  Which seems obvious of course, but again, it may need to be his own decision.You could say ""I know there must be a lot of things you are thinking about.""  And leave it at that.  Because you'd only be saying the truth. A suggestion that it would be OK with you if he did find someone to talk with…that sort of permission might be helpful as well ?But yes, it's a delicate situation alright, so I do hope that you can keep posting.",,,,,,,,,,
5,06/18/2021,ARFIDpartner,"I have been dating my boyfriend for over a year now (have known him for longer though) and he suffers from ARFID. As someone who has close friends with eating disorders, I am understanding of it, but it has not been without struggles. I love to cook and make food for others and go out for dinner... and although he also enjoys the act of cooking/experience of a restaurant, I really miss sharing a meal with my partner. I have brought up seeking professional help in the past and he agrees that he needs it, but there has not been a true effort to do that. Wondering if anyone can offer advice or share an experience they have had with a partner with ARFID? Thanks!","I’ have suffered with ARFID FOR THE PAST 60 years!  I have missed out on Company trips, fishing trips to Canada, dinners out and any get together involving food. My family knows but doesn’t understand and although I love a good conversation, this issue is my “skeleton in the closet.”  I cannot eat any fruits or vegetables without violent gagging, vomiting or panic attacks. When I was young I contemplated taking my own life.  I am a type two diabetic so being able to eat nutritious food is a matter of life and death.  Until a week ago when I googled SED SELECTIVE EATING DISORDER, I never knew what caused me to be,this way or maybe now there my be some hope here. I read about the doctor in London that uses hypnotherapy and said he has a ninety percent success rate with adults.  I’ll bet I am the oldest person to contact you.  I want to eat well and enjoy better health. Currently I get tired more and more lately even though I am a service man for a builder.  The most startling issue I have is my increased lack of strength.Some say this can be brought on by trauma when we are young. I heard all of the symptoms and it all sounds like me. I just want to be,able to get up one,day and,eat without fear of gagging or worse. Can you help me",,,,,,,,,,,
6,07/09/2021,Troublepersuadingmygirlfriendtoeat,"Ok so first off I was already really big into nutrition, eating healthy, all that. I have a pretty good understanding about how many calories someone needs for their body weight, how many micronutrients, the different hormones involved like leptin, all that. I feel like I’m personally pretty reasonable when it comes to food and nutrition.This is where my issue comes in.A while ago I started dating my current girlfriend, I really love her and I care for her a lot. I suspected something was up for a while but I didn't want to pry and let her come out and tell me it, and she did a few months ago when she told me she had an eating disorder. This was very worrisome for me because my grandfather died of complications due to malnutrition during childhood growing up in war torn europe, and I do not want something like that to happen to her. I've been as supportive as I can be, helping educating some basics of proper nutrition and how important it is and I've tried to be as both supportive and helpful as possible. I'm the only person she's told, but she plans to get help relatively soon and bring it up during a therapy session (she goes to therapy every so often for other reasons that are probably related but I'm not gonna get into).The problem is this: I'm trying to encourage her to eat more as she drastically under eats daily. Some days she's pretty good but more often than not she's under eating. Her metabolic system is basically shot and she rarely gets hungry, and she gets full very easily. She's agreed that she'd do her best to get at least one substantial meal every day, however I have trouble with this. Often times she'll eat a light snack and nothing else and keeps insisting that she's ""eaten today"" when she really needs to eat more. I'm really worried for her physical health, her emotional state and the healthiness of our relationship. How do I persuade her to eat at least a bit more when she refuses to? Any help on the matter will be greatly appreciated, thanks.","I perfectly understand your concern but as a survivor from an eating disorder, I can tell you ""inviting her to eat"" or even forcing her will only cause problems in the relationship.
Better invite her to get proper treatment and ask her how you can better support her. Most of the times what we want is ""to feel normal"" and others to ""avoid putting too much attention to what we eat/don't"".Of course, you can show her with your example how eating healthy is. Education does not cause any damage.Cheers

7,05/18/2021,GirlfriendwithEDbrokeupwithmeouttheblue,"Hi all, I’ve seen quite a few similar posts on here which I’ve read through, but for my own peace of mind just wanted to post/ask about my own experience. My ex has been suffering ED since well before we met, but it was something we were both aware of from early on in the relationship. My mum had severe anorexia when I was younger and thought I might be in a better position to provide support for her. As with many of the posts I’ve seen, I thought our relationship was in a great place. We were both deeply in love, I had a connection that I’d never felt with anyone else before and both of us seemed to believe that it would go the distance. There were obviously times when the ED was hard, it was difficult for her when I went to exercise, or for some social situations. She also often had suicidal or self-harm thoughts. The last time we were together was on Boxing Day, and it was one of the happiest days we’ve had together. After that we went into lockdown (didn’t live together), so we were unable to meet at all. In that time we messaged and calls most days and I never got the sense anything was particularly wrong. Suddenly, after 3 weeks in lockdown, she calls me out the blue and starts talking about how bad the ED has made her feel about herself, how she needs to focus on recovering on her own, how she needs to focus fully on her final 6 months at uni. The whole thing completely shocked me and all I can really remember is how matter of fact and certain she sounded about everything. I can definitely come to terms with certain parts of that, like why you’d want to push someone away or feel like you need to work on it alone for a while etc. I just don’t understand how her feelings could have changed that quickly. Is it common for that to happen? Or was her ED confusing her? Or is it more complicated than that, perhaps that she doesn’t feel like she can or should love someone in her state? This question has been bugging me for months. I feel guilty, but part of me wishes that she had seemed more sad about it. We haven’t been in contact that much, on occasion I’ve reached out when I feel really depressed (for better or for worse). It still sounds like she’s sure of her choice. She says that she does miss me and cares about me, but she’s not said anything about actually feelings for me. She also mentioned that she thought she might be gay now. How should I react to hearing things like this? And what might be causing her feelings and emotions to be fluctuating like this?I obviously miss and love her deeply, and after 4 months am still struggling to let go. I feel like I know more about what she’s going through than most of her friends and family and I genuinely want to be there for her. Like I said, she says she still misses me and cares about me, but hasn’t made any effort to reach out in the last 4 months. Do I take this as a sign that she doesn’t actually need me, or that it’s actually a really tough time for her and I need to find a different way of letting her know that I can be there for her?Thanks in advance for any comments and thoughts.","Yes, the ""pushing away"" thing.  I'm sure you've seen it mentioned over an over here, so it really is something that's common.  Common, but unsettling, that is.""I just don’t understand how her feelings could have changed that quickly. Is it common for that to happen?""People with EDs often talk about how ""fake"" they feel, and how much energy it can take to seem ""normal"".  Like they are always having to put on an act, when they are trying to ""act like themselves"".   So it's possible that those feelings became overwhelming for her, and she felt a need to cancel her relationship with you, because she was really a different person than you thought that she was and etc.  Which is ED talking I'm afraid, because often we can see the person much better than they can see themselves, when ED is in control."" I feel guilty, but part of me wishes that she had seemed more sad about it.""EDs really can have an effect on people, to a point where they can feel like there's no room in their life for emotions. Like they really have to get serious about things, you know ?  With none of this romantic foolishness.  My sense is that she would normally be feeling sad about this, but…self-discipline, you know ? ""She also mentioned that she thought she might be gay now. How should I react to hearing things like this? And what might be causing her feelings and emotions to be fluctuating like this? ""People with ED's can find themselves suffering from ""sense of self issues"".  Their thoughts are pulling them in so many directions that they can have a difficult time defining themselves.  You've seen what a wonderful person she can be, but there's also a reason that EDs are defined as a mental illness.  They can have emotionally disruptive effects way beyond just the food and the eating aspects. And yes, four months is a while to not be getting any energy from her, particularly when things seemed so good in the past. You can often hear people with EDs speak with regret about how they ruined their relationships too.  Which may be how she feels.  That she's ruined things between the two of you.  I've been in situations like that myself, where it was the other person who screwed up, through lying or through other reasons, and despite my willingness to forgive them, they don't want to have anything more to do with me or the relationship.  That the relationship reminds them of too many personal faults which they believe that they have. I'm not sure what you can do in this situation.  It's likely that she's having some real difficulties with her ED, and has a lot of ambivalence about where she wants (or is able) to take things, and that that may be what's at the heart of all this. So "" I know things may be being rough for you"" may be the best response you can give her right now, because that's likely the truth of the matter. In any case, just some thoughts.",,,,,,,,,,,
8,05/11/2021,Sidelinedduringrecovery–anuncertainfuture,"Hi there! So glad I stumbled on this forum - reading the stories from selfless partners/spouses and the heartfelt responses has made me feel far less alone in my situation.I’m currently having difficulty with my relapsed girlfriend who is nearing the end of her ED treatment. I know I should be grateful for her progress and honesty but she recently requested for space saying that she is unsure on the future of our relationship together. This is hugely conflicting because not only have I supported her through her previous recovery, and despite making my love and care for her known, she appears to have consciously moved away from giving our relationship any of her energy. I do understand the mental and physical demands of treatment and the sheer effort her recovery takes. Likewise I don’t begrudge her for putting her health first. I just want to be there for her and support her through this journey as best I can without being viewed as a taxing commitment.To give some background, my girlfriend (24) and I (28) live with our respective parents only 15 mins away from each other. We’ve been together for nearly three years. Both relatively inexperienced in relationships, we had a long period of infatuation that possibly bordered on codependency. From the start she was very forthcoming about her struggles with her ED (atypical anorexia nervosa) and other health issues such as depression and anxiety. In 2017, briefly before we met, she came out of inpatient treatment and was tightly sticking to a set dietary standard. For all intents and purposes she had it under control. It was challenging but knowing it what was keeping her well was enough for her to take it seriously, and for me to be enamoured with her strength, willpower and confidence.Problems arose in August 2020 when a diagnoses of CFS/ME, meant that maintaining her commitments became more and more hard work. Not even she knows the exact trigger, but this fuelled her eating disorder and old habits of over-exercising, calorie-counting and general dissatisfaction around her body image arose. New professionals told her that this diet she kept was actually a form of restrictive eating and exacerbated the disorder. She was now conflicted, frightened and unable to get treatment freely as our health service prioritise ED support almost solely on weight. In short, she did not look sick enough to help.Fast forward to Feb 2021 and she sought support for herself from private day clinic. She took time off work and began with video calls five days a week for a few weeks (owing to COVID-19), but has more recently scaled down to weekly sessions of one video call day and one in-person day at the treatment centre. This treatment is due to finish next week and a new hour-long therapy session per week has been arranged going forward.While it’s incredibly encouraging that a good portion of ‘normality’ has returned in her life - she is back at work, finding freedom with food, going out with friends etc - our connection only seems to have only degraded. Our frequent messages, calls, FaceTime’s and trips out just a few months ago, have fizzled to just a couple of paltry texts a day. I try my best to encourage her with affirmations and token gestures, but I am now starting to worry about the impact of this long-term lack of intimacy and communication.There have been points in our relationship where my naivety to ED’s and relationships in general has verged on insensitive. One instance recently I candidly told her that my needs weren’t being met. My intent was not to prompt shame or disregard the severity of her own situation, it was just my way of trying to keep the communication between us open and honest, despite it being confronting. This upset her massively and I’m regretful of how I handled that situation. I feel like this is partly why she is now reaching out to friends rather than me for support. I should be grateful that she has such a supportive team of people, but I can’t shake the feeling she is rallying the troops for a difficult conversation that may lay ahead. Maybe she is viewing recovery as a form of self-renewal and believes I was in love with the ‘still unwell’ version of herself. Or perhaps she genuinely does feel like she cannot give me what I need right now so has taken the decision to put the relationship on ice to work through what she wants.Either way, I have no idea how long I’m going to be waiting, what exactly I’m waiting for, or what to do for the best. I want to remain loyal to her request for space because ultimately I love and respect her in her entirety, ED or not. I don’t want to risk a knee-jerk reaction by demanding a conversation for fear of jeopardising progress in both our relationship and her recovery. However my support network are quick to point out the effects that this situation has had on my own mental health and that my needs do require being met for the relationship to work.It’s worth noting that not only did I lose my job at the beginning of the pandemic, I also lost a close relative and another suffered a brain injury. This has led to me putting a lot of pressure on my partner for my own happiness. While aware it was unhealthy, the relationship provided a sense of escapism which I think added to the the stressors and pressure which I am now missing an outlet for.Currently I’m working on bettering myself and hitting personal goals, but putting my future in my partner’s hands is proving increasingly difficult to manage.","If you've read some notes here, I suspect that you've seen that this ""pushing away"" thing is super-common.  We can beat ourselves up over small comments we've made, and try and discover what we may have done to cause it.  But really, you've probably also noticed how kind and caring most of the guys here have been, when they write and mention their situations.  So it would probably be wrong to try and take on too much responsibility for what's happened, or get too wrapped up in ""if only""s.This is just a guess of course, but she may be feeling tentative and doubtful about her recovery, even though she's getting therapy, and etc. I may be wrong about this, but it's possible. People in that position aren't looking for affirmations, or "" I know you can do it !"".  They are often uneasy, and worried about what their future may be. While I know you are trying to avoid being demanding, she may hate the idea that she has to live up to anyone's expectations, either positive, or negative or whatever.  What I mean is, your only sin may be that you are another human being.Probably the best thing you could say is ""I know things may be rough for you now.""  Because they probably are. Which that's what you are looking for now ; things that you can agree on, you know ?And ugh, sorry to hear about all the things you have been through yourself.  It's not out of line for you to hope for some support from her, and I'd not be surprised if she's been trying to give you some.  If anything, people with EDs often understand hard times, so hopefully she's not been turning away from you where that part is concerned. Otherwise, you may just have to wait out this phase of things.   Perhaps she'll want to break up, or maybe she'll what to stick with things.  But it sounds to me like things aren't being all that great with her recovery, and when people are unsettled in that situation, it can be hard for them to commit to anything.","Thanks BobJ, I really appreciate your response.I totally get the ‘pushing away’ thing. It’s a tough situation, especially when it feels like you’re the only one it is happening to. I seek solace in the fact that it’s not likely to be personal and that this is behaviour typical of someone in my partner’s position.Truth be told, I don’t know a huge amount about what is going on in her world or her head right now. And because that communication isn’t currently there, I can only follow her lead and reciprocate contact from an ‘outsiders’ perspective. Following your response I’m holding back on the affirmations and mainly just focussing on acknowledging her situation to make her feel heard when she does message. Even then I feel like I’m overthinking my responses, but I’m endeavouring to keep things light and in the present.In the meantime, I’m willing to carry on waiting and trust that I will know when it’s time to adopt a more proactive response to the distance. I have been focussing on the image of that unwavering redwood you mentioned elsewhere. I’m also finding the advice that you gave about being responsible for only 50% of the relationship incredibly helpful in processing my responsibility in all this too. Many thanks again.","""Following your response I’m holding back on the affirmations, and mainly just focussing on acknowledging the situation to make her feel heard when she does message. ""Yep, I think that's the best approach.  ""Being known and heard"" is what I think people are mostly  looking for when things aren't always going so well. ""Even then I feel like I’m overthinking my responses, but I’m endeavouring to keep things light and in the present.""We can strive for the perfect answer it's true, but sometimes that's a good exercise too.  Like it can help us adjust what might be our normal approach, so we end up learning things too.As to what's going on in her head, a lot of self-doubts, probably.  EDs tell a person that they absolutely should be doing one thing, while their rational mind lets them know that they should be doing another.  The clash between those two things can be really unsettling for the person, and when people are unsettled…that's when ED loves to pounce. Which can make for some really tangled feedback loops. Loops which are hard for outsiders to influence, and where  "" I know things may be difficult now""  can often feel like the most understanding  response.",,,,,,,,,
9,05/03/2021,GirlfriendUnmotivatedAfterMonthsofRecovery,"I wrote on here once a few months back. My girlfriend of almost a year and a half has been in and out of ED treatement over the past few months. She's a freshman in college like I am. She had to defer last semester, and this semester she did her classes in the online format. Needless to say, she missed out on a lot of stuff. More recently, she has been doing her recovery via zoom with her team of therapists, dieticians, etc. and she was given an ultimatum that if she did not meet her weekly meal goals in the next two weeks, they would look into intensive inpatient care, where she would be admitted into a facility and be monitored all day every day for 5-10 weeks. I say all of that just to paint a picture of the situation she's in. She missed so many things over the past 6 months that she had been looking forward to doing. She is feeling particularly unmotivated to meet her recovery goals because she feels like she is stuck an endless pattern of ""spiral downhill, seek help, make improvements, repeat."" She simply doesnt want to go to a facility with full-time care because she's missed so many things in her life already, she's just sick of it. And I totally get that. But I'm just so tired of watching the ED win her over repeatedly. Surely fighting like hell and missing out on a few things here and there is worth eradicating the ED from her life for good, right? I think she knows that, but she is just so tired of trying and falling short each time. I'm simply asking what I can do to help her when she feels stuck in a hole and too tired to dig herself out. She will beat this, I absolutely know it. And she knows she will, too, but the fight is brutal, it's long, and it is certainly not easy. I'm not even the one having to fight the ED but this has been one of the most challenging moments of my life. Any feedback is much appreciated. God bless.","Hey there, ""Surely fighting like hell and missing out on a few things here and there is worth eradicating the ED from her life for good, right?""
 Yes, you would think so, but at the same time people can get really discouraged. Particularly if they've been through a big string of ups and downs. So yeah, it can be easy to lose their motivation, particularly if they are dealing with depression as well.Keep in mind the idea that EDs are often about accomplishment. Or they were when the person first got into them. Boy oh boy; seeing that weight go down, or at least striving to see it.  So the theme of accomplishment can be a big one for them.  Recovery can involve the theme of accomplishment too, and yet if they feel that they are constantly failing at it…you can see when they might lose their will to proceed.So it's like you said, "" she is just so tired of trying and falling short each time.""Also, people with EDs can get that ""all or nothing"" kind of mind set, from when they first got going with their ED.  The numbers on the scale go  down, and they can feel that they are on top of things.  The numbers on the scale go up, and they are a total failure.  When your brain gets used to thinking in those terms, it's hard for it to change it's outlook, and feel any sort of satisfaction with shades of gray, or with  uncertain progress.  So they have a lot of mental stuff to fight against when it comes to those ways of looking at things."" I'm not even the one having to fight the ED but this has been one of the most challenging moments of my life."" I know what you mean, and to be honest it's not selfish or self-centered of you to be feeling this way. We care about the person, so we want to feel like we're actually adding something positive to the situation. And when it feels like we aren't…I'm sure I don't have to tell you how that can feel.
I've been in this gig for many years now, and talk with a lot of people who are in your GF's situation.  Like yourself, I've had to struggle with how to go about being supportive in ways where the person actually feels supported.And it's been my experience that what feels good to people is when they feel understood.  So I'm not all ""Oh I know you can do this !! "" or necessarily being  all positive about things.  I'm more like "" I know this must be discouraging"", or ""I know this must suck.""  ""I know you must worry about what the future may hold.""This may seem like taking a negative rather than a positive approach, but actually people seem to feel better when they feel that the other person gets it about them, and gets it about what they are going through. Because EDs can be lonely things, and while we can't really fix other people, we can help them to feel understood. And there can be comfort in that, if that makes any sense ?In any case, just some thoughts.Keep writing ?",,,,,,,,,,,
10,04/26/2021,Supportingmygfthroughherrecovery,"My gf and I have been dating for about a month now. She has been open about having an ED since our first date. She is happy to tell me facts about it, etc. But, when it comes to her struggles and feelings with it, that is a different story. Like for example, Saturday night she insisted she was fine. Then, she went to the bathroom for a long time and I later figured out she had been crying the whole time. I tried to talk to her about it, but she refused to tell me what was wrong. She finally said it was ED related when I asked, but she wouldn't tell me how she was feeling, or what had happened. She just said she did something stupid. I feel very shut off when this happens. It feels almost like she is trying to push me away. She says it feels like I don't care, which I really don't understand. She has admitted in the past that she doesn't think it's something I do, but I feel like I need to change my approach. I tell her I'm there for her, ready to talk about it. But, if she won't tell me specifically what is going on, I feel like I have to make super generalized statements and really don't know what to say. I feel like I just end up saying the same things over and over. I ask if there is anything I can do and she says there is nothing. I do feel like part of it is a self esteem issue. I have a hard time believing people care about me as well. I know I can't fix the problems, nor is that my goal. I not be able to help directly, but I want her to feel loved and supported. Any advice would mean the world to me. Thank you!","Hey there.  I'm glad you took the time to write.And yes, EDs and the way sufferers deal with them can seem mysterious alright. I'm not sure what your GF's behaviors were before, but it's not too difficult to imagine what must have happened in the bathroom. My guess is that she may have  had a bulimic episode, which if this is not a normal behavior for her, can feel like a big failure to the person.You are also right about how there are ""the facts"" and then there are the feelings that the person is having. And you are right about the self-esteem issue too. What seems to us like them acting like a normal day-to-day person, can feel to them like they are struggling, and are barely able to put up an acceptable social front.  Because of what horrible human beings they actually are, and etc.  Not horrible because they have an ED, but just horrible and unworthy in general.  This crumbling of self-esteem is really common among people with EDs, and is one of it's most unfortunate symptoms, because as I suspect you've seen, your GF is not a horrible person at all. "" But, if she won't tell me specifically what is going on, I feel like I have to make super generalized statements and really don't know what to say.""I talk with a lot of people who have EDs, and for myself, I don't really need to know the details. All I really need to know is that the person is struggling. And as you might expect, I make a lot of super-generalized statements too.  Which despite not being particularly specific, can be fine, and a comfort to people.  "" I know things must be difficult now ""….I mean, how general is that ?  And yet it's a true statement, and people can feel a little bit better, knowing that someone else understands that part. "" I may not be able to help directly, but I want her to feel loved and supported.""Well exactly.  While we may not be able to come up with an actual ""thing"" we can do, support is something that we can provide. Depending on how much of that the person will allow, of course.   My sense has always been that our best responses come when we try and put ourselves in the other person's shoes.  Like we can't necessarily think of something that another person can ""do"" for us, but if we feel like the other person understands us and our situation a little, then that's where the comfort comes from I think.

11,04/20/2021,WorriedaboutmypartnerED,"Hello, my partner suffers from a ED I assume. We have been together coming up 9 years and when I first met her she was X stone .. at the age of 17. She struggled putting on weight or eating proper meals and enough food. As the years gone on I promised my self to help her gain weight, now she’s 25 and we have moved out to our own place she has put on weight and now she’s at X stone which she is only Xft so she isn’t very tall. So Iv been so proud of her Anyway her life is hectic, stress with her family mainly her mother suffers from depression and neglect from her father and sister who has things going on and throwing getting comments to my partner about her weight etc. So the only positive things she has is friends and me so I can see where her depression started. So sometimes she has good weeks and some times there really bad but she can not look at her self in the mirror without knocking her self sick. Everyday it’s in her mind that her weight or body isn’t correct for a 24 year own women and sometimes she can’t even leave the house or do things that she would love todo. Some meal times are hard she doesn’t know what she wants or when she eats it’s only something small or she can’t get half way through a normal meal. At times she doesn’t want to eat and it frustrates her because she really wants to but her her mind making her feel sick just looking at her food. When she does have good times it’s eating X which she can have a good amount no problem. I’m just looking for some advice because I’d do anything for this girl. Iv now ordered some weight gainers just to experiment. She will never ever be happy unless her gains weight and it’s been that long Iv tries my hardest to support her but it feels like I’m drowning im running out of options or ideas. There is plenty more to say but I’ll leave it as this for now thank you for any advice","Dear Johnn-towns, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove weight, heigt numbers as well as specific food items, as these could be triggering to other users.

It can be expensive it's true, and there's no guarantee it will work, but it sounds to me like she'd really like to get better, which is a hopeful sign in situations like this.Keep writing ?",,,,,,,,,,
12,04/20/2021,Partnerisinasituationwheretheycannotreceivetreatment,"This is my first time posting in here so I am not sure if the format is right, but here goes. My partner is struggling with their relationship with food (they don’t want to outright say they have an eating disorder) where they restrict themselves to one meal a day. This is not healthy for them and I would like to help them but I don’t know where to start. They are set on losing weight, as they are in the overweight BMI category, regardless of whether they need to as a health concern or not. At this point they are unable to receive treatment which is beyond our control, but I would still like to help them. I asked them today if they would accept my help and they said yes which I am very happy about, but I don’t know where to start. Any help would be appreciated greatly. As a side note if I am using any language that would not help please let me know, as I don’t want to make things worse for them.","Matters like this can be a delicate situation, it's true.  It's a positive sign that she seems to want help, but as you said, what sort of help should we provide ?If it were me, I would right ahead and ask her, and see what sort of suggestions she has ?   At least that way you could feel that you were taking an approach she would approve of.   As long as what she asks for seems healthy, that is. Both physically, as well as mentally, you know ?",,,,,,,,,,,
13,04/02/2021,Partnerrelapsing,"First time talking about this to anyone...my partner has said they're struggling bad at the minute and is seeking professional help again (they're good like that).I was a little surprised and hurt that they didn't tell me they were struggling before. I know it's an ongoing thing but I thought their recovery was still going well and am annoyed at myself for not noticing things were getting bad again. Little habits I've noticed have started to creep back in. Like I bought three different types of small canned cocktails for us and they chose the only one which had the caloric content stated. They said it was a comfort thing, to know how much they were consuming. A few years ago when things were really dire, I remember them telling me certain foods affected their periods (and, like an idiot, I bought into it), but really they were just scared of the calories. It was very worryingAnyway, just venting a little I guess. I'm scared things are going to get REALLY bad again, like they were a few years ago when we were trying to date for the first time. The disease consumed them so much they literally didn't have it in them to continue the relationship with me. When we got together properly in the summer of 2020, they promised they were better now and they'd never, ever let themselves get that sick again. I truly believed they meant it when they said they were better but I very quickly discovered that wasn't the case.I'm glad they get help when they need it but they don't believe they'll ever overcome those thoughts and that it's all about ignoring those thoughts, not getting rid of them. I'm just so scared they'll die young. That's my ultimate fear, that even if they do 'recover', all the damage they've done to themselves will ultimately end in a premature death. Their liver is already very damaged and their skin is often yellow, so I know organs have been affected. According to their doctor, they're a 'healthy weight' at the moment, but there's still no periods. They've just started running again and dancing most nights and doing up to 3 hours of yoga. I think it's too much for a recovering body. I'm hoping this is just a setback, not a full blown relapse because I don't believe our relationship will survive it a second time. My anxiety is sky-high and I'm trying so hard not to let it show because they are the most sensitive person in the world and have said so many times they don't ever want to be a burden on me. They aren't, but this disease is. It's affected everything. I'm not the one suffering with it but it's on my mind all day everyday as well. We don't even live together yet, but plan to at the end of this year. This worries me, because they eat well when we're together for the one full day we get a week when we're not at work, but I know they have many secret eating habits that I don't see but will be hard to hide when we live together. I hate that this is something I have to think about. It's like a third member of the relationship, we've even named that part of their brain! I hate it and feel so guilty at the thought that I truly don't know if I would have gotten back with them had I know they were still suffering. I love them so much but I'm not sure my own mental health can cope with this for the rest of our lives.Sorry if that was a lot, it's just a bit tough at the moment.","Hi holzi, Welcome to the forums!

In addition, you can check out our resources for loved ones here. Keep posting!",""" I'm not the one suffering with it, but it's on my mind all day everyday as well. ""No kidding, ED's effect everyone who's involved, so I hope you won't feel bad about the fact that you care about this as much as you do.  It's unsettling, it's true, but it's also a reflection of the caring sort of person you are.  So I hope you can see it from that angle too. As far as the relapse goes : That can happen.  She may have honestly thought she was past it all, but as you are seeing, it can come back again too.Who knows what the trigger was.  Maybe she felt she was ""undeserving"" of being your partner, or having a relationship at all. People can become worried about that.  Rather than you telling her that you think she's wonderful, and trying to reassure her (which is our natural inclination in situations like this) instead  you may want to say ""I know you may worry about how our relationship might go.""But yes, all the running and yoga and etc ; People can equate that with ""being in control"" and ""being good enough"".  It's not an ego thing, it's often an insecurity thing, where they are trying to reassure themselves of their self-worth.
Which only they can do.  Our efforts to reassure them often don't do anything.
But what can feel reassuring is when they fell that someone else ""gets it"" about what they are going through.  Which is often a lot of self-doubt, and worries about the future.  ""I know you must worry about what the future may hold.""  That may not be the sort of cheery outlook that we're all supposed to take these days, but she'll feel less alone with her feelings if she knows that you understand that.
And yes, it's authentically hopeful that she's seeking help. ""Taking a step for ourself"" is a very good thing to hear that she's doing, so I think you can draw hope from that as well.
Otherwise, I hope you can keep writing if it seems to help. It's not weird that this is having an effect on you.

14,03/31/2021,Partner/ExBrokeupwithmeduetoanEDandnowI’mconcernedfortheirhealth.,"Hi, I would first like to say that reading just a few of the forum posts has been very helpful as I can relate to every single one I’ve read which is of great comfort to me in my situation. And a special mention to BobJ who has provided some excellent advice to others on the forum.I would like to know if it was possible to talk to BobJ privately about my specific situation. I understand by replying on the forum could be of benefit to others but my partner, current ex, asked me specifically not to talk to anyone about this so I feel posting on an open forum somewhat betrays the trust they have put in me, and in addition they have previously mentioned that they have been seeking help via helplines and forums. So in short I am worried about them seeing this post, despite its obvious anonymity. However if necessary I could be willing to post some details on the forum.

As far as I know the symptoms don’t require immediate medical attention, but it is something that needs monitoring. I was only wondering if there was a private messaging option on this forum but it appears not. So here it is below.","HiSorry if this is poorly written, I’ve never been a great writer and apologies as I may have missed out details of their recent relapse of ED as we only spoke about it once when we broke up so I was pretty emotional at the time and I’m not sure I know the full extent of their suffering. I’ll give a little background to fill you in. We met just over 1 year ago and it was everything I could have wished for in a relationship. We were apart for 2 months because of a national lockdown, and afterwards we lived together for 3/4 months. In September of last year we had to move to a long distance relationship (around 2 hours) and we managed perfectly, seeing each other at least every fortnight. We last saw each other just before Christmas and multiple things have prevented us from meeting up since. These include their housemates having to be especially careful with COVID as they were teachers and nurses, as well as their ever growing workload that comes with being at university. On my end helping my parents to build their new house would also take up a lot of my time so I was also to blame. However initially this year things were normal, we would FaceTime a couple of times per week and we would message each other around 30 times every day, so it was quite intense but I feel that was needed to maintain a long distance relationship. But over time, specifically since their exams were over (they have anxiety for which exam season is a particular trigger) we would talk less and less. We stopped FaceTiming completely and they’d only send me 2 messages per day, which were typically either answers to my questions or one lined responses, which would avoid any emotional content so I’d end up having to carry the conversation. This continued for around a month or two before I asked to meet them on their way home from university. This is where they explained to me that they were suffering with a purging ED. They mentioned feelings of being overwhelmed, not being able to give 100% and that I deserved someone better than them, all I assume stemming from the ED, for reasons that they were going to break up with me, despite me offering to try and help them with the situation. They even said I was free to hate them for how they hadn’t been a good partner and encouraged me to block them on social media. They found it especially difficult when I had mentioned to them about a month prior that I was struggling long distance and that it would amount to almost 4 months between seeing each other. They felt that I shouldn’t have to go through this with them as we’d been through too much already and that our relationship was a case of right person wrong time. In addition they mentioned control, as they couldn’t control when we could see each other so they then focused on controlling their weight as that is the only way they could be ‘perfect’ for me. Something I didn’t notice at the time but upon reading other posts I realised that they were lacking emotion when talking to me which seems common with people suffering from an ED. I asked if we could just take a break and they said they couldn’t commit to being ready at a certain point. I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do would be to respect their decision and give them some space and time, especially as they had mentioned seeking help on helplines and forums. However they trusted me with this bit of information as they haven’t told anyone about the relapse, not even their family. My partner had mentioned to me mid way through our relationship that they had suffered with a restrictive ED when they were in their early to mid teens. They were almost hospitalised with it if I remember correctly but they managed to overcome it without any treatment for their mental health so if I’m right it was never dealt with at the root cause. In their family it is never spoken of, and all pictures have been either deleted or binned from that time so they have had hardly anyone to speak to about this. In addition to this they have struggled with anxiety after a serious case is septicaemia (this was just as we began seeing each other), but as a couple we worked through this and they got professional help for this. It also hasn’t helped that over this year they have been dealing with food intolerances, so they put themselves on a very restrictive diet to find out what was causing it, and it turns out as soya and probably wheat. Anyway, now it’s been around a week since we broke up and we have had no contact. I’ve drafted a message to send to them but I was waiting at least a week to send it, just so they have had a bit of time and space. Even though I’ve seen them upload stories to their social media portraying like they’re having a good time with friends and family, I’m obviously massively worried about them, hence this post, and had a few questions about the whole situation. 1. How should I first go about contacting them, as having read other posts it can be an extremely difficult thing to do. My initial thoughts would be to just check in on how they’re doing and offer myself as an option if they wanted to ever speak about it to someone they care about, as well as make sure they’re getting the help they need.
2. Is there anything I can do to help or is it best to let them deal with it on the hotlines they have been using?
3. I’m pretty sure but it seems like the ED is the reason for our relationship failing, but part of me feels it’s cowardly to blame it on this.
4. This is very selfish of me, and I would never push them into anything if they weren’t ready, but what does the future hold for us? Is it common for couples to get back together after a period of time because I feel that this relationship is too good to let just fizzle out.","Unfortunately,  it's not an option on here.",""" They even said I was free to hate them for how they hadn’t been a good partner and encouraged me to block them on social media.""Isn't this a terrible way for her to look at herself ?  That she'd be such a terrible person, that she'd be perfectly worthy of treatment like this ? It's a sad thing alright, but with EDs, quite often people find themselves feeling like this.  Unworthy of even friendships, because of what a terrible person they must be.  You saw some of this in the lack of emotion in her posts too. People can believe that things would be better if they became emotionally numb to everything. At the same time, as you saw on her social media, ""Everything's fine"".  Which it isn't, but it's much safer and causes many fewer problems to pretend that it is.  She may indeed be hanging out with friends, but not ones who know what her issues are, I bet.  But since you are the one who does know…well, it's just complicated, and things would be easier if she just set you aside.  This sounds cold, I know, but it's possible that she's just not ready to confront her situation yet, which she knows that she'd have to because…of how you care about her.  So things really can get all tangled up like that, where the fact that we care ends up being a negative rather than a positive.
Great, huh ?
As to your questions, those can be hard things too.  We would like to be of help and support to the person, but perhaps as you are finding out, it's going to depend on if they are willing to allow us to be part of things or not. So we are kind of at the person's mercy in that regard. Which can be a pretty helpless feeling for sure.
If you were to write her, I'd try and keep it brief instead of going into things too deeply.  I would not mention how much you miss her, or  say anything that implies that you are in emotional pain yourself. You might want to mention that you understand that it may feel safer to her to limit her contact with you, because that's probably just how she feels. Not because you are a bad guy, but more because you know too much.  Which of course should not be a negative either, but if she has a lot of ambivalence about her ED…she may not want to get into that with anyone now.
So I'd just try and keep things fairly light, if you were to write to her.  If you want to mention the ED, I'd just say that you know she may be struggling with things, and that you know that that can be a difficult thing. And leave it at that. Also, she already knows that you have affection for her, so I would not go into that too much either. Basically I'd say that you'll always welcome hearing from her, so that you are leaving that part up to her.
Because yeah; she's still dancing around the idea that you know about her ED. Is she going to see that as a good thing…or a problem ?
It's a drag when we have to leave things up to the other person like this, but that may be your best strategy now.","Thank you very much for your reply, it’s some very useful insight. I feel as if I need to write to her as by not doing that I feel like I’m giving up on her, which is the last thing I want to do as I know how great she is. I feel there’s such a fine line between being there for her enough and me giving too much so that she completely shuts me out!
Thank you so much again","Codman,Yes, you put your finger on the issue I think. How do we show that we care, without the person pushing us away ?  As you said, it can feel like a really fine line.
Then there's the part where we can start being hard on ourselves, and blaming ourselves for ""not saying the right thing"", almost as though we deserve to think poorly of ourselves for caring.  It can get kind of ridiculous that way.
None the less, sometimes you'll hear people talk about how they appreciate that their partners stuck with them when they being a ( the ""B-word"" here).  So it's probably reasonable to still give some credit to how things were when it felt like you guys did have a connection.
So in one sense, you don't want to let ED bully and intimidate you, and make you feel lousy about yourself. On the other hand we probably don't want to intrude too much either.
"" I know that things may still be kind of rough, so I want you to know that I'm still thinking of you.""
Like keep it basic, you know ?","Thank you again for your response and I wish I’d have seen this before I’d jumped the gun and sent the message. I feel I may have made a mistake by sending a message which is longer than the one you suggested. In a nutshell I prefaced the text by saying if she wasn’t open to talking about it then she was perfectly welcome to ignore me. I then mentioned that I had briefly looked it up online and that I know I’ll never fully understand how she feels but I would be there to talk with her if she ever wanted to. I then finished the message by wishing her all the best and hoping she’s having a better time being with friends and family.
On reflection this seems overboard and that it may put unwanted pressure on her, but this could be me overly worrying about not being able to say the right thing like you mentioned. It’s been a few hours since I sent the message and I feel in a state of limbo, not wanting to do anything but wait until she gets back to me, which obviously isn’t a guarantee. It’s just hard for me as this is unchartered territory, but your responses and advice have helped massively, so I again thank you.","I know you may regret some of what you wrote, but at the same time we don't want to get dragged too far into the Twilight Zone in situations like this.  What I mean is, on some level it should be OK to expect that we can engage in regular every-day sort of conversation, rather than our feeling like we have to walk on eggshells with every sentence, or have an advanced degree in psychology in order to communicate with the person.  That's just not how life or relationship should have to go, you know ?
Having said that, I'll admit that certain strategies may be better than others.  As you said, the person is in a sensitive situation, and we don't want to put too much pressure on them.
For example, we know how terrible someone is feeling.  They've been our friend for a while, and we've exchanged notes with them in the past, and then suddenly….nothing.  In my head, I'm worried, because I know they've done certain ""rash things"" in the past.  So it's true;  I'm worried if they are still alive or not.
But…I don't want them to feel like I'm pacing the floor with worry.  Which would not be an unusual response on my part. But even so,  I don't want them to feel like our friendship is a burden on me - one which they are responsible for.
So right - How do we craft a note to them in circumstances like that ?  Or if we do finally hear from them, do we just pretend that we weren't worried ?
Which actually is our best stance I think. Maybe there are circumstances which would cause any person to worry.  But not us, you know ?  We are sustained by a certain inner confidence that things will be fine.  I was on a board with parents once, and you can imagine how they must feel seeing their kids go through things like this.  Their feeling was that you have to ""Act like a Redwood"".  The winds can blow, and the storms will come, but they just continue to be sturdy, like it's not upsetting them.
Maybe we don't have to be as dramatic about it as that, but their feeling was that a ""Don't let 'em see you sweat"" - type of position was what was the most helpful in the long run.
 So when I don't want to put pressure on someone, I'll just talk about a nice hike I went on, or show them a picture of a nice sunset I saw.  Or mention how my garden is growing.  Things like this show that I care, but don't involve ""getting into it"" if you see what I mean ?  Plus, I actually did go on a nice hike, and I did see a nice sunset, so I don't feel like I'm BSing in any way either.","I see where you’re coming from, the analogy with the friend really resonated with me and I completely get the Redwood tree (funnily enough in the house I grew up in there was a redwood tree and I can’t remember it blowing in the wind once). And actually that’s what’s helped me most with the breakup, as talking about other things with friends has made me feel more comfortable than delving into the subject.
She’s got back to me this evening and she admitted that she’s not been doing too well and that recovery is going to be a long process. She also asked how I was doing which I feel is a good opportunity to apply the advice you mentioned above. I’ll tell her about a couple of things I’ve been up to. One last question, and I know it may seem like you are baby feeding me at this point, but is it worth letting her know that I’d like to stay in contact with her, as long as she’s ok with that. I’m sorry but I’m still trying to get to terms with the not trying to step on egg shells, I’m sure it will come with time!
I can’t thank you enough for all of this and all of the good work you’ve been doing for others on this forum, it’s been massively helpful.
UPDATE
She has got back to me this morning and mentioned that with all her uni work that she’s completely overwhelmed and that me messaging her puts added pressure onto her. So I guess for now she wants to shut me out and there’s nothing I can do but respect that decision.","""She has got back to me this morning and mentioned that with all her uni work that she’s completely overwhelmed and that me messaging her puts added pressure onto her. ""Yes, and when yesterday things seemed hopeful.  So I think you are seeing more of how EDs can effect people.  One day staying in touch and sharing feelings feels important, and then the next day…it doesn't sound like such a good idea.  People with EDs can feel conflicted about this, and that's where some of the pressure comes from.  Not so much from you wanting to engage, but from inside themselves, trying to decide what feels safe to them.  By that I mean, not that you as a person are unsafe, but whether or not she feels it's safe for her to be thinking about her situation at all.
Which is how it can be when things get rough for people.  It can feel like the best approach would be to just try and ignore it all. But when it's messing a person's life up, and intruding on their minds in the persistent ways that EDs do, ""just ignoring it"" can be extremely hard to do.  So I think what you are seeing are her back-and-forth struggles with that.
And you are a liability, because you do know how serious it is.
On the one hand she trusted you with the knowledge so that she would not be alone with it,  but on the other hand, she probably wishes that nobody knew.  So again, it's the back and forth thing. Which is probably some of what she meant when she said she was not doing too well.
I'm not sure if you should stop writing her or not. On the one hand, it's unhealthy for her to be shutting you out.  You've seen how exciting it is to get a message from her.  For her, seeing your name in her inbox may be exciting too, but more in a "" I don't want to have to think about any of this"" sort of way, no matter how friendly your notes may be. In any case, I would not give up hope.  EDs do a pretty good job of bullying everyone who's involved, so try not to let this one bully you.(And yes, what about all the drama?  If we care, it can be hard not to be drawn into the drama. So keep the""Being a Redwood"" thing in mind, and see what you can do to keep your perspective, and a tad bit of emotional distance from the moment-to-moment aspects of it all. )","When you say she probably wishes no one knew, I believe this is spot on. I think the one of the few reasons she told me was because she had made up her mind with regards to breaking up with me, potentially believing this would relieve some of the pressure on her. This would have been extremely confusing for me to understand had she not told me about her ED. Transparency in our relationship had been extremely important to her and one of the main reasons we had been so good together.
With regards to writing to her, I think I’ll give it a couple of weeks. It’s only fair on her part that I respect her request that we don’t speak for now so hopefully that bit of time will give her the opportunity to grow and feel a little better about me offering myself for chatting. But I don’t want to give up on her that easily. What I’m getting from her responses is that she won’t be able to open up to me and start chatting regularly until her uni work has settled down, and I know her term doesn’t end until mid June which seems way too long to go without at least checking in. It’s just hard as at least for now I guess I’ll never know what stage of recovery she’s at. I don’t even know when it first started, although I do have my guesses."
15,03/25/2021,Concernedaboutgirlfriend'seatinghabits,"My girlfriend of four months is a very picky eater. She is a vegetarian, and she does not like certain foods and many other things. She is also extremely thin. When I introduced her to my parents, ""your girlfriend looks malnourished"" was not the response I was hoping for. She does eat a mix of foods. When she eats, she eats very slowly, cutting up her food really small. She is very active, playing sports and going to the gym pretty much every day. When we are together, I feel like we only eat meals because I am hungry - she tells me she doesn't usually get hungry.Early on while we were starting to date, I told her that I was concerned about her eating habits, but she said ""Don't worry about me, I am getting enough food."" I let it go, since, after all, if she had an eating disorder, she would not eat certain foods, right? And I wanted to believe her, too. Eating disorders are very serious business.Recently, I brought it up with her again, and I asked her to humor me and take the NEDA eating disorder screening test. She took it and it showed that she was not at risk. She said she's always ate like this, she's never lost a lot of weight in a short amount of time. She seemed pretty taken aback, and I felt bad for accusing her. I want to believe her and I want to believe the test, but I can't shake my feelings. She doesn't feel sick - she never gets sick, in fact. And she's always full of energy -- I've never seen her get tired. She is an excellent endurance athlete. She exercises like an athlete, but she does not eat like an athlete. Again, not all the foods she doesn't eat are unhealthy. She also doesn't like one type of food, and she does like other types. But I am concerned that her food intake is falling short of her body's needs. Is this just picky eating, or should I continue to push her to ask her doctor or a nutritionist?","Jake,Yeah, it's hard to tell what's going on.  It's true that some people are naturally thin.  And of course we're all supposed to be concerned about ""health"" and ""healthy eating"".  And golly, aren't we all supposed to be going to the gym every day ?  And feel guilty if we aren't doing so ?  Isn't this the sort of thing that society envies ?Of course it is.  But it can also provide an acceptable cover for behaviors that aren't necessarily healthy too.I went out with someone like this once. She was a highly accomplished athlete, and had won all sorts of statewide trophies.  But at the same time she would lie, and be deceptive about matters that were extremely important to our relationship.  I liked her, and think about her still, many years later. But she had a lot of problems which continue to get in the way of her having a full life. I'm not sure what the situation is with your partner.  People who have all sorts of rigid rules for their life, and who find it difficult or impossible to be flexible those rules, what are we supposed to think about that ?For example, say for some reason she could not go to the gym for…5 days. Say she challenged herself to see if she could do that. Would she be able to cheerfully do that, like most people would, or would she find herself getting anxious and consumed with anxiety ?
Also, have you gotten any hints about how her self-esteem might be ?  People can hide that pretty well, it's true, but often things like this are tied into those kinds of issues.  Like ""Am I good enough yet ?"".  Some people can have a hard time with that, and judge themselves in ways that can cause problems. Because some people have excessive-exercise problems, and the dynamic around the thing is much like the dynamic that surrounds eating disorders.  Like they both have similar addictive and emotional aspects which is like they are half-sisters of each other.
Again, it all could be nothing, so take this with a big grain of salt.  But keep an eye on her moods, and her ability to deal with frustrations.  And how easy it is for her to be flexible with her rules and routines.Anyhow, just some thoughts.",,,,,,,,,,,
