0,10/29/2021,BoneLossandRecoveryAssociatedwithAnorexia,"Hi,  Our daughter has been suffering from anorexia/orthorexia for approx 2 years now. Her weight dropped greatly and while she has recovered most of it back she is still in the grips of the disease. She has shown reduced bone density as exhibited in DEXA's done the past 2 years (3 done annually from July 19, 2019 - July 2021).  She also has a rare genetic affliction called Hypophosphatasia (HPP), which also can cause problems with bone density (although the symptoms shown by those suffering it vary widely from no symptoms to it being fatal in infants). I also have the disease and have never shown any signs of bone loss.  So, before blaming any bone loss on the HPP (and being resigned to a treatment regimen we are not in favor of) we are trying to get some specific information on bone loss and recovery associated with anorexia. My questions are 1) how long after the onset of anorexia does bone loss begin to be evident, 2) how long after gaining the weight lost by anorexia (i.e., back to the pre-anorexia weight) is it before the bone loss is reversed, and 3) how long would it take to get back to pre-anorexia density (if that is even possible)?  We have seen doctors, therapists, dietitians, etc., and I am not convinced that any of them really know these answers, and the easy way out is to simply agree with the geneticist who she is seeing for the HPP who simply blames it on the HPP and appears overly anxious to get my daughter into a study using this fairly new drug because there are so few patients in her category (as the disease is so rare).  Does anyone have any knowledge about this, or know where we could look?  Are any relevant reference works available? Some objective statistics would be great, but any thoughts anyone might have are welcome. I feel like just seeing another doctor isn't the answer.  Thanks! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,10/21/2021,Daughterstrugglingincurrenttreatment,"Hello.  This is my first post.  My teenage daughter has been in a residential center only for a few days before they recommended she needed to go to a hospital for a feeding tube (via nose).  even though she was only at that center for 4 full days, she didn't eat any of her meals and barely drank water or supplemental drinks.  She's been bounced around with different therapists up to this point and residential was recommended as we tried virtual and that was not effective. I want her to go back to the residential because I feel consistency is key.  right now the dr's at hospital are focusing on her meds so she can be released and those thoughts go away.  You see my daughter's body image is distorted big time.  I want her to eat, she's still given meals at the hospital and she has been drinking her supplements but get the feeding through the tube at night as well.  I'm so worried and frustrated with doctors and the process.  I'm exhausted and wish there was something I could say so she knows that she will die if she doesn't eat.  She keeps saying she is okay but she isn't, I mean she's in a hospital. anyway here have experience with a child that had to have the feeding tube and how they came about removing it and finally eating?  I just want to hear from another parent...I'm alone.  Thank you so much.","One thing to remember about EDs is that people in your daughters position are going to be feeling that nobody really gets it about why she has to starve.  Because she does feel like she has to, or else…something bad is going to happen.  ""She'll get fat"" is her main concern, but ""getting fat"" is a stand-in for all sorts of other worries she has.  Plus she feels in control when she restricts, and feeling in control is a huge part of eating disorders.
So go to the hospital and they're going to force you to do every single thing that feels totally wrong to you.  Which is how you see recovery to be - you lose all of your sense of control, and everything that other people are going to try and force you to do feels absolutely wrong. Which who among us ever feels comfortable with that idea ?  No one that I know.
The folks at the treatment center aren't set up to deal with people who may be dying because they won't eat.  Imagine their legal situation if one of their clients died while they were supposedly taking care of them. So you can see why they'd want to ship someone off to the hospital in order to medically move them away from that possibility.
Having said all that, I can pretty much promise you that there's a part of your daughter that understands that she might be in trouble.  Sure, she still may want to push forward with her ED, and continues to view it as a positive thing.  But there's going to be another part of her that knows that it's not.  For one thing, just look at all the disruption it's caused for her, and the worry and concern that it causes for others. There's no way to spin any of that in a positive direction.
What it's going to take to turn things around is hard to say.  Guilt-tripping her is not going to help her feel better about herself, and the war-of-wills thing which can happen in treatment can be problematic as well.
So you'll have to see.  Her own decisions about things is what will make the ultimate difference. Rather than decisions that others try and impose on her.
Having said all that, the idea that you as her parent, would be open to hearing her real feelings in a sympathetic and non-judgmental way…that may help her feel more at ease.
Which people with EDs generally don't feel at ease in the least, so anything you can do along those lines is likely to work in her favor.
In any case, wishing the best for all of you. With EDs, when things are at this stage, it's rare that anyone feels good about anything, so try and keep a level head if you can, and see what you can do to take the moment-to-moment sorts of things in stride.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Your comments are logical and helpful.,"I agrée with the above reply- when our children who are ill are forced to face their illness, and recover / recieve treatment, the ugly side comes out.
What you are hearing is your child’s disorder trying desperately to escape a place where it is being directly tackled!! DO NOT LISTEN!
they are not allowed to talk during meals likely because many patients would speak inappropriately about the food, or try to distract staff through conversation so they don’t have to eat.
They cannot stand without permission because many sufferers will have a standing compulsion (trying to burn calories)
People do not talk in groups because they are shy or scared: this is normal
The calorie talk and complaint about feeds  is clearly the ED talking.
As for the rest of her complaints: I believe her ED will be trying to demonise and portray the residential as far worse than it is!
stick to your guns, and please please don’t listen to the ED!!!! you are stronger than it, and your daughter is where she needs to be.

I am devastated, and will never forgive myself for not learning more about this terrible illness. If I had known, now,  what I recently learned (over the past 8 months) I am sure she would still be alive. (She would definitely be struggling and the road to recovery would have been a difficult two years - if not longer - but she would be alive. I miss her every minute of every day. We were so, so close; until the last 8-9 months.  We fought, she lied, she hid the laxatives, and made promises that she never intended to keep.  Her brain had deteriorated, due to malnourishment, and her eating disorder became a severe mental illness. I was told, over and over, that she would die if she did not receive the help she needed; yet, the hospitals did not provide her with the help she needed. Our system is broken and anorexia is different for each person. There is no one way to treat it.

I’m sorry to hear about your daughter; seeing a child struggle with disordered eating isn’t easy and it shows how strong and caring you are to reach out and ask for help. I see that you’ve already received some really good advice from others, but I also wanted to add that not everyone’s road to recovery is the same. As mentioned above, the NEDA helpline can help you find support options that can determine the best course of action that suits your daugher personally. Navigating this situation may be difficult but remember, recovery is possible. I hope you and your daughter are able to stay safe and take care.","Looking for a forum or blog to join parents discussing what help and other resources available to me as my daughter has agreed she has a dysmorphic image of herself. She is below the 8th % for weight in girls her age. She came home for a short visit from college and is at lowest weight ever but describes her self as puffy of fat after eating quite often
Suggestions","Interesting post and perspective. I agree with much of it. I have to wonder how healthy it is to only focus on the negative aspects of the relationship though. I realize that emotions are powerful but my personal feelings and perspective changed when I accepted my own failures without laying blame and acknowledge the positive things my parents did do when I was growing up. They are both deceased now and I wish that things had been better when they were alive but none of us could seem to get beyond the emotional fog of the past. I think this is what forgiveness feels like. I guess I'm saying that I accept things as they are. They did the best they could even though it wasn't what I needed and I have failed at times and those failures lay squarely on my shoulders. I'm not naive, I do realize that there are varying degrees of toxicity and some people will not change but I have to wonder if our only real power lays in our ability to empathize and forgive. just a thought.","It is so hard to read all of these posts.  My daughter has suffered with disordered eating for many years and it has been a daily battle.  We have dealt with the lowest of the lows, thoughts of suicide, self-harm, feelings of hopelessness, feeling worthless, serious medical complications.  You name it, we've been through it.  My heart goes out to every parent who is trying to keep their child going one day at a time.  ","It is so hard to read all of these posts.

My heart goes out to every parent who is trying to keep their child going one day at a time.  We went to treatment centers, therapists, nutritionists and nothing worked.  If anything, working with ""specialists"" made her more resentful and made her dig her heels in more.  What worked for her was getting to the point where she had such alarming chest pain that it scared her so bad that she wanted to turn her life around.  She no longer wanted to live like this.

10,09/11/2021,Nervouslyawaitingtreatmentfor9-yr-oldrestrictingfoodintake--whatcanIdotohelp?,"My daughter turns 9 this month. She has been deeply depressed by isolation and changes during COVID. Over the last few months, she started expressing unhappiness with her body image. This past summer, she developed a habit of collecting saliva in her mouth and not swallowing. Her pediatrician suspected it was a medical issue. We went through an endoscopy and a hospital visit, and after we came home from the hospital it became clear that she was deliberately restricting her food intake. I'm awaiting her initial visit with a counselor. Until then, my fear is that she will get too weak and I will have to take her to an emergency room. I'm worried that it is affecting her cognitive function; it's like she's often in a fog. She simply isn't the same girl that she was earlier in the year. I already consider this a crisis situation--at what point does it become an emergency?","Hi amandaleigh, welcome to the forums.

15,06/25/2021,AdultDaughterSufferingFromFoodAvoidanceED,"My 24 year old daughter, who has lived in another state for the past four years, has returned home with a relapse of anorexia, taking the form of food avoidance and texture issues. In the past, she has been treated for anxiety and depression, with both medication and therapy. She left home to attend school, living with boyfriend. Her relationship (thankfully) ended and she lived on her own for some time, then quit attending school without informing us (she was in a cosmetology program), so all the money we had invested was gone. She began a new relationship, which seemed great, made a single semester stab at college, then moved to another state with boyfriend. The relapse with food issues began off/on last summer, after she had been prescribed a medication for depression/anxiety. She read this medication also can suppress your appetite, so she discontinued it and therapy. Things have gone downhill from there. Her relationship has deteriorated, not only due to her issues, but her boyfriend's controlling and verbally abusive behavior, which really intensified her eating problems. I finally told her to leave and come back to our home, as that was clearly a toxic environment for her. She's been here two weeks. She has always been on the slender size, but is currently less than her normal weight.. She does not NOT eat, but she says at times she'll spend a long time just trying to get herself to eat something. If I cook a meal, she'll eat it. She doesn't purge, she sees her body clearly as it is. We are looking at the best way to get her treatment now and residential seems out of reach financially, even with insurance. We're trying to find counselors to treat her, but she keeps rejecting everyone because she says (based on online info) that they don't have experience with her specific type of ED. On top of all this, she's floundering in terms of knowing what she wants to do with her life in terms of career, boyfriend will not leave her alone, she's conflicted about the relationship - basically, a ton of bricks. I'm unsure of how to move forward with her. She's welcome to stay in our home and receive treatment here, but past issues have made us impatient with her. In the past, she's gone through psychiatric treatment and therapy and didn't following through with it. The ED in the past seemed to be a component of anxiety problems and was helped by treatment for that. She was put into an involuntary psychiatric hold after cutting herself so badly it required a trip to hospital for treatment. That was a nightmare that did more harm than good. She no longer cuts.

19,03/05/2021,Howlongcansheliveonnutritiondrinks?,"New here and first post. My 15 year old daughter was diagnosed with restrictive anorexia about a month ago. We knew things where going down hill at Christmas. She has been working out and getting in phenomenal shape since last spring. Eating healthy but always eating enough. She was counting calories but always maintained weight. She actually was counting calories so she could eat what she needed to build muscle. She is an amazing volley ball player and came into 9th grade strong as an ox. December came and she got mono. She lost weight because of it and it spiraled her very quickly into very restrictive eating. Long story short she just came out of children's hospital 2 days ago after a 13 day stay and a beginning of a re feeding program. The stay was brutal, but by the end she was eating most meals and came home on a high calorie meal plan. Yesterday she ate half of breakfast and half of lunch. Since then has refused all food. The rages and yelling have stopped, she just sits for the half an hour and just stares, doesn't eat anything, then I give her the supplement and she drinks it in a few minutes and goes back to the couch. doesn't speak to me or anyone unless its to tell me she hates me or i should burn in hell. How long should I let her just drink the supplement beverage? literally today she drank all her calories in beverage form. when do I push and say she can't have it and must eat? and if she refuses? I hate that its the weekend and I can't get a hold of her team at children's hospital. I have to wait til Monday. do i make her sit until she eats solid food or just be happy that shes drinking the supplement?","Hi Maare, welcome to the forums.

They will only accept consent from a person who is clearly not able to provide it.Its as bad as kids getting released from the same program that she is in without any go-home plan. Some parents are not told if the patient has eaten or not, what they are eating or even what the plan should be to carry on the treatment within the home setting.Its very easy to point fingers and become paranoid about what appears to be the cutting off of communication between the patient and the parents, but we will never and are not doing that.

There are other programs out there that use FBT or Family-based Therapy. It sounds like that is what you want to try.,"Thanks for the reply - this is indeed ""family based therapy"" which is why its so confusing to many. This is the third FBT program we have been in and they're all the same - poor communication between the program and the family. Its a poor set up. The programs require the heavy lifting to be done at home (and it is torturous as Im sure you are aware, unfortunately) but provide absolutely no feedback and leave the families guessing what to do. Its very strange.","Thanks for the reply - this is indeed ""family based therapy"" which is why its so confusing to many.

ED centers need to do better. She quit school and her job to attend this center who dumped her for struggling with the ED she was there asking for help to deal with, without so much as a single follow up to see how she is doing or to help in anyway with the plan. We deeply regret her stay at this location because it really has made things much worse.","Boy, I'm sorry you had such a lousy experience with this residential outfit.

If it were me, I'd advise you to keep trying to find a place for her, rather than allowing this experience to cause you to give up.  One way you might get a better idea of what certain programs are like is to check out those websites where employees can leave feedback on what it's like to work at various companies.  I've done that before for various ED treatment facilities, and the information I've found has often been…informative.","Did you try family-based at home with help from ED specialist, dietician, and family therapist? It is the Maudsley Approach and is done 100% at home--except for visits to your outpatient team (unless it's all virtual due to COVID). If your daughter wants to recover and is willing to try it. You become the residential. It's VERY hard but it works for some families. We tried it, and it was going well for weeks but my daughter started binging/purging at night and rejecting her meals...among other problems. We did learn a ton if we ever choose to reboot and go that route again. There is a ton of preparation that has to go into it before you even begin: setting up a contract with your child,  a consequence/reward structure, finding an ED specialist who specializes in FBT, etc. etc. One of our big mistakes was not taking away all privileges, which could be earned back gradually by eating. We were not prepared and informed enough on it to be successful. I would approach it very differently and be much more prepared ....like you are training for the fight of your life...before launching into it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each horror seems to be tied into the rest, so much that talking to, helping her with one means addressing some of the others. I have to time my attempts well, at the risk of her shutting me out. Talking about her bulimia seems to provoke the most anger, so I am careful with it.She is a college student and plans to head back to school in a couple weeks. I don't know how she did it, but she managed excellent grades this past semester. Part of me wants to keep her home for the spring, but the other part, the beaten-down part, is relieved at the idea of her going. I realize therapy would help me, as well, but I am barely affording her care.As I type this, I wonder what it is, exactly, I am looking for by posting. Perhaps I wonder if there is anyone out there who is experiencing such a storm. I realize an eating disorder, alone, is storm enough. My exhaustion, worry, and heartache often leave me wanting for neat, organized thoughts on the matter of my daughter, as if a map of her life, of my life could be drawn that would leave me without trailing caveats, without questions. At this point, she and I seem to be at the mercy of a miracle.Thanks for listening. Peace.","soosan, my heart goes out to you. You are a strong woman, who is suffering greatly. I can relate in small regard since my daughter has ODD and possibly BPD in conjunction with her ED. It's exhausting and brutal. I've heard that NAMI has a good program for parents. I am so immersed in ED treatment right now that I haven't reached out, but as soon as my daughter is in PHP I will. I look forward to the family therapy that the PHP program offers and getting my daughter into dialectal behavior therapy and meds--I think that is her only hope for a somewhat ""normal"" life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can review our community guidelines here. Thanks for your understanding and please continue to post!","I was you about 6 months ago. Getting my daughter into weekly pediatrician visits was the first step. The pediatrician and I talked in advance. The next step was getting her working with an ED specialist, not any other kind of therapist, but one whose primary focus is EDs, especially in teens. This all came to a head with hospitalization mandated by her pediatrician before real ED therapy w dietician could begin. Next step was refeeding in the hospital, because of the effect of malnutrition on her brain, weight restoration had to happen quickly and asap. The ED thrives in the malnourished brain, which is said to shrink up to 20%. From hospital, she should have gone to PHP or residential, but due to COVID there are long waitlists everywhere. So we brought her home intending to do the Maudsley Method or FBT. For 3-4 weeks it went pretty darn well, she had significant gains and got her period (only once so far). Now 6 weeks in and still waiting for PHP, she is backsliding. Anyway...I hope this offers some help to know the experience of others. The treatment situation is really hard right now and I'm confident the lack of support is why my daughter is relapsing. Waitlists everywhere, so call and get her on some now.. Every day without ED treatment the ED grip grows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't know that I have any good suggestions for you, as I am in the thick of a similar situation with my daughter. Certain approaches on my part are effective only on certain days; it seems there is no one successful prescribed path for a parent of a suffering child. It is indeed all-consuming. I do believe that maintaining loving and open communication with your daughter is vital (though not always easy). There have been times my daughter has shut me out completely, which I calmly accept, indicating I will be there for her. She always comes back. Ultimately, though, it seems they have to WANT to get better, to get help. You can only do so much. I have a daily conversation with myself about this, which is exhausting. I also try to remember to take care of myself, to find physical and emotional outlets, to breathe. Being outside, listening to music, spending time with our pets (among other things) can be healing, even if temporary. Your well-being is essential.","Hello, James.

26,06/06/2020,24yearolddaughterhomeforCovid-19,"Good morning,
Our daughter came home for Shelter in Place mid-march and during the past 3 months her eating disorder has progressed to the point where she is isolating in her room, door closed, only coming out twice a day to eat. She gets food quickly from the kitchen and retreats to her room to eat. She is severely restricting, eating as little as possible. She is severely underweight.
We, her parents, are going to tell her that we want her to see a medical doctor because we are concerned about her health. If she refuses, we are going to tell her she cannot stay here any longer, as we cannot participate in her destruction.
Has anyone else done this? Taken a hard-line such as this with the hope that the sufferer seeks help? We don't know what to do. She is angry, isolated, lethargic, and refuses to speak to us. Please, if anyone has had a similar situation, what did you do? She is not under any therapy at this point, though we are going to encourage that.","I'm on a board for people with EDs, and with the lockdown a lot of people are retreating.

What do you think of sharing with her the symptoms and the consequences of anorexia? That is, I am not sure she realizes the damage she is doing to her body and to her mind.

She made that deal with us prior to her first year of college, which she completed, but her health declined.  So, we said no more money.  It took a year to really kick in (about 6 months for her to realize we were serious, and another 6 months to find a program to go to).  So in the grand scheme, she has missed this last year of college.  But, I'm happy to report she is finally getting the help she needs, and she made the decision to go to a residential treatment program on her own.

But, I'm happy to report she is finally getting the help she needs, and she made the decision to go to a residential treatment program on her own.  Her motivation is to get back to school (which she LOVES), so that has worked.  At the end of the day, the beauty of this is that we didn't have to force her or argue with her, we just didn't write a check.  Unfortunately, it took us awhile to find a ""pain point"" that 1) motivated her and 2) we could implement without fighting.  One key here is that we did not forbid her to go back to school......she was free to go back and pay for it all on her own, but we knew that was pretty unlikely.So back to your question......I don't know if kicking her out is the right answer or not, but we did seriously consider it.  Other ideas we considered were taking away the car and taking away the phone.  In the end, college money seemed to be the best option for us.  It was emotionally hard to do, but I was 100% certain it was both right and fair.  I am hopefully the progress continues and she can manage things better going forward, but it will always be a struggle for her.Over the years my wife and I spent alot of time beating ourselves up over this entire situation, so let me also offer you some encouragement.  This is not your fault and you are not a bad parent.  And your daughter is not a bad/mean person either, she is just suffering from a very difficult and frustrating illness.  In fact, kudos to for doing your homework, looking for answers, and trying to help your daughter.  In the end, we had to realize that WE could not fix it.  WE could not MAKE her do anything.  They have to choose to fight.  I wish you and your daughter the best...…..and make sure you take care of yourselves too!","Thank you for your response. Our middle daughter also had an ED, orthorexia (she was a competitive swimmer), and it took her a year of outpatient to finally decide she wanted to get better. She did a 5-week in-patient (at age 16) and that worked. She is now 20 and thriving. But, as you say, it was HER decision, and that made the difference. We had been forcing her for a year to go three days a week outpatient, and it didn't work.
This older daughter has anorexia (restricting), and has the whole self-loathing, guilt, and so on that is common with ED. We know we need to confront her (we suggested that she see a doctor for a physical and she flipped out), but her anger keeps us from speaking up. We will, though. She is out of school, but we will also tell her we cannot help to support her unless she gets help. Perhaps in the long run, that's all we can do.
Thank you for your story. As you know, it's all very confusing.","Thank you for your response.

28,01/01/2021,Adultchildwon’teat,"My daughter was a bottomless pit as a child. She ate everything in sight. She came home one summer after being at her father’s and said she wasn’t allowed to eat there—couldn’t have seconds, couldn’t help herself to the cupboards, etc.  Then when she was 15 she wanted to live with her dad. I let her, after so many struggles. She started fainting there. Then after a year, she went to live with my sister. My sister said she would hardly ever eat. She had to force her to eat. She fainted there, too. Then after a year, she went to live with her stepmom. She fainted there, too.  After a year, she came back to live with me. I cook, but not all the time. She’s very picky. If I make something she doesn’t want, she’ll storm in her room and say, “I guess I’ll starve.”  I have gone out of my way to buy food that she asks for. Usually, the food goes bad or just sits in the cupboard because she doesn’t “feel like eating that food anymore.”  The stress was getting to me. I was constantly worried I wouldn’t fix the food she wanted or worried that because we have leftovers, she won’t eat. So I had her stay at my dad’s house for a few days. He had a car he was going to give her  to motivate her to get a job. (She’s 18 and never had a job.) He wasn’t able to get it registered in her name, so she was in a bad mood when she came home. She said she was making a grocery list so she can have food she will actually eat, said grandpa had food she could eat. I asked what food. She told me and said “he actually cooked for us when we told him we were hungry. I’m tired of looking anorexic.”  I said, “you can’t blame me for you not eating.”  She said yes she can. My husband defended me and told her not to blame me for her choices. She got mad and went in her room, slammed the door, and called her friend to pick her up. She texted me and said she’s never coming back, said I’m a horrible mother for not doing things for her, for not cooking, etc.  Obviously I cook. I post new recipes I’ve tried on instagram all the time. I feel like there is a deeper issue here, but I don’t know what it is. Whatever I say to her, she twists my words and says completely the opposite of what the truth is.  I don’t know if she wants me to hand-feed her like a baby or what.","Hi Dneill79, Welcome to the forums! We edited your post to remove mentions of specific foods.

29,12/24/2020,Howtobepatientwithmydaughter,"My daughter is 13 and it was just this week that we realized how serious of an ED she has. We are beginning treatment next week, but I feel like I am losing my mind when she eats so little. I have personally suffered from bulimia so I know that the disorder is screaming at her that she can't eat more and I also know that I can't force her to eat more because it will make her feel like she is ashamed or angry or whatever. But I spend nearly every waking moment feeling like I'm going to be sick because she is so thin and the amount she eats is barely enough to sustain life. If I leave her alone, she acts much like her normal self but it's eating me alive to stay back. How do you handle the emotions that are so overwhelming? Her siblings are angry with her because they blame her for making me cry so much. I've talked with them about how she isn't choosing to feel the way she does and that her mind is not well right now. They've definitely improved, but I want to stop myself from being so emotional all day long. I do go to a therapist myself, but after talking and feeling better when I get home, I see her with the tiny portion of food on her plate and my heart is ripped open again. Do any of you have advice of how you are patient with your kids?","Hi! Thank you for posting. We’re sorry to hear about your daughter!

It is incredibly disturbing to see this going on and not be able to do anything to change it. Starting treatment should give you some peace of mind. I feel like she is the only one who can decide to get better; all I can do is provide the tools (therapy) and do what the specialists tell me. We just started with outpatient therapy, so I have not received much coaching yet. My husband is good at reminding me that this is one hurdle she will face in life...not to downplay its seriousness, but to remind me not to let it consume me. She is a challenging person and we will always have challenges with her. Reading the posts from recovered sufferers helps too. Taking deep diaphragmatic breaths often in a series of 3-4 and meditation help me. Maybe journaling will help get some of those emotions out. If you are not seeing an eating disorder specialist, that may be the best type of therapist for you to talk with as well.","I just found this forum and it is so good to connect with other parents who are struggling with the same issue.  Origamimommy, I completely understand.  My daughter has struggled with anxiety and depression for 3 years.  She also cuts herself.  Despite being in treatment and improving in some ways, she has now added an eating disorder to the list.  She is now working with an eating disorder specialist in addition to her psychologist and psychiatrist.  She has completed DBT.  Some days things seem better, but some days she doesn’t eat and I just feel hopeless.  Like you, I have another child and I worry about what this is doing to him - right now I am crying in my closet because I don’t want him to see! I could really use some stories of hope, but it’s at least helpful to know I’m not yet the worst parent in the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,11/17/2020,Worriedmom,"My daughter has been doing outpatient treatment with a team for 2 1/2 months.  She is of age and refused inpatient. She is monitored weekly.  She has made some progress but not enough and she still is not allowed to engage in any activity.  Her therapist and nutritionist are seeing progress but the MD is not satisfied.  This is devastating to her, however, progress is slower choosing this route of treatment.  This was her wish but she seems resistant to the treatment at all.  She wants to just do things on her own and says she wants to be done with the treatment team.  I am not even sure what I am asking.  I feel like I can't force her to do something she isn't truly ready for but am also just so worried.","Hello. I am new (as of this week, in fact) to this forum, and just wanted to reach out to say you are being heard. I am so sorry about your daughter, and though my circumstance might be different, we are clearly in the same larger boat (as we have come to this site). My daughter is back from her first semester at school, and while I knew she was in a bad place, I was smacked with the reality of how rough it actually is when she returned home. She is headstrong and self-destructive, and I am terribly worried. This is all just to say that I nodded my head in recognition when you wrote that you are not sure what you're asking, and that you feel you cannot force her into something for which she isn't ready. I am so sorry. You are not alone.",Thank you so much.  I am sorry to hear about your situation as well and wish her all the best. Yes it is so hard...

My daughter was the one who first came to me to tell me she started purging ""sometimes"" while she was in school. When she returned home, I recognized that it was or had grown much worse than that. The few times I have brought up the subject, I have done so with love and understanding; but any mention of fear about what it is doing to her body and mind are met with anger. It seems she focuses much of her outward anger on me. So, I back off but still let her know I am here. It is a delicate dance. For two days, she managed not to purge (which I figured but which she announced to me), but is back in the brutal cycle again. I can hear her and I can see it in her face and vacant stare.

She has made mild improvements in her medical stability but is not fully where she should be just yet. She wants to stop seeing the doctor that is monitoring her which means the therapist and nutritionist will no longer work with her.  The doctor visits bring her such anxiety for the few days leading up to the appt. I am crushed but also it is still clear she does not want this.  I don't know how to make her want it.....","Great advice from Annet above.  As a dad of a recovering daughter, I just wanted to add a few words of encouragement from a parent's perspective.

We also spent alot of time trying to ""make her want it""......and Annet is right, has to happen when they are ready.  In our case, missing a year of college (because we stopped helping with tuition!) is what made her want to change.

My 21 year old daughter has recently come forward and admitted she needed help with her eating disorder. We recently found out 'how bad' things were and after some examinations, it seems that a treatment center is going to be the best thing for her. She suffers severely from anxiety/panic attacks as well and I am hoping that this type of treatment can help her. I am beside myself with grief that she is struggling so badly and has been hiding it for so long. Now that she has ""come out"", she is overwhelmed and exhausted. ","Hello everyone! I hope you all can help me with this. My 21 year old daughter has recently come forward and admitted she needed help with her eating disorder.

She suffers severely from anxiety/panic attacks as well and I am hoping that this type of treatment can help her. I am beside myself with grief that she is struggling so badly and has been hiding it for so long. Now that she has ""come out"", she is overwhelmed and exhausted. She, on her own, did some research and found this center in New York that has a day treatment program (virtual due to Covid). She fell ""in love"" with the place as they seem to do more than just ""therapy"" including things like yoga, art therapy, etc. She has talked with the counselors (we have as well) and has started with a nutritionist. She has had a medical evaluation and it is the center's suggestion that she do a full time day treatment program (5 days a week, all day) for at least a month and then downgrade (potentially) to a nightly/weekend program.    The center does NOT accept insurance and is very expensive. In the beginning we talked with my insurance company and they said that after we hit our VERY large out of pocket maximum, they would pay 100% of the bills.  Now, as we are two weeks away from her starting the program, we find out that although the insurance company does pay 100%, they only pay 100% of the ""fee scheduled rate"" which is about 10% of their actual fee.

Thanks for listening!","I’m sorry to hear that your daughter has been struggling with disordered eating for so long; navigating through eating disorders and anxiety at the same time must feel draining. But, it’s great that she is starting the process towards recovery; it takes a lot of strength to open up and ask for help. I can’t say which treatment route would be best for your daughter, as she and you know her needs better than I, but I would like to suggest that you reach out to the NEDA helpline. The helpline has trained volunteers to help you find treatment options, navigate insurance issues, and provide overall general support. You can reach the helpline by calling 800-932-2237 Monday through Thursday 11am-9pm ET and Friday 9am-5pm ET; you can also use the online chat to speak to someone Monday through Thursday 9am-9pm ET and Friday 9am-5pm ET. I hope your daughter is able to find all the support she needs on her road to recovery; please take care.",Thanks for your response. I have already reached out to the hotline and they unfortunately cannot answer my questions as they are not professionals. I was just wondering if someone had any experience with this situation. I understand no one can answer that question for 'sure'. Most are telling us that 'generally its better to have consistency'. I happen to agree. My daughter is adamant that she wants to start at the original place as it was the only one she 'liked'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

35,10/29/2020,Whatistherightthingtodo,"My daughter is 20 years old and suffers from anorexia. She is amazing, and she sought out help for herself. She is in therapy, she sees a psychiatrist for medication for her depression and anxiety, and she is also getting help From an  Eating disorder clinic. She is working on trying to eat more each day and tryIng  not to purge.
Because of Covid, she is living at home for the last few months after having been living in an apartment and going to college. Her college classes are now all online. Moving back to our house was very difficult for her, and ended up triggering her eating disorder which had been in remission for the last couple of years.
My husband and I are having a really hard time knowing the right thing to do under certain circumstances. It is hard to know whether we are speaking to my daughter or to her eating disorder when she asks us to do certain things. When my daughter asks me for a snack and tells me that she will be fine with it as long as I stay with her for a while after she eats it, and I give her one, and then she ends up throwing it up, I feel terribly guilty and that I made a mistake. But on the other hand, she is 20 years old, and it’s not like I have so much control over what she does. Sometimes, I will give her that snack and she will end up being fine. But how am I supposed to know when she asks me the next time whether she’s going to be fine or whether she’s going to purge afterwards? I know that in some ways this is a rhetorical question, but I’m trying to figure out how to live with the consequences of the times that I Make the mistake and give her the snack and she ends up purging.","I am glad your daughter trusts you enough to ask you for a snack and accompany her.
As patients with eating disorders, we also do not know when we will be able to tolerate a snack.

So, if she continues to ask her for a snack, that may be another opportunity for her to try to eat it and keep it. The only thing I would tell you is to avoid any kind of conversation related to food, eating disorder behaviours, family problems or anything that could make her feel uncomfortable (and triggered).","I am glad your daughter trusts you enough to ask you for a snack and accompany her.

At first, doctors thought it was appendix causing his stomach issues, ( which was removed) then the second time, doctors thought he might have Crohn's disease.   After scoping his esophagus, lower intestine and middle intestine, they could not find any evidence of of the disease.   All they noted was that he had high eosinophils and a "" swollen"" intestine and gave him medicine for an overactive gut.   At first, my son cut out red meat.   Then he decided to go vegetarian, then vegan, then he cut out anything with a certain ingredient, and most recently another ingredient .He obsessively check labels for ingredients and expiration dates and declares most everything not suitable. ""I ate that recently & it made my stomach hurt so I don't eat it any more"". He had a fantastic job ~ 2hr away so he doesn't live at home.

The biggest roadblock in her recovery is our inability to help her gain weight, even while monitoring X meals, X snacks. We spent many months in active therapy and were hardly able to get her to gain any pounds. We measured our success in ounces. To complicate matters, she's hyper-metabolic with multiple food sensitivities. I'm so tired and frustrated and overwhelmed by this disorder. I fear what will happen if she can't fully recover by the time she turns 18. That's less than a year and a half away. ","I am looking for a good FBT-friendly app to help me track my 16-yo daughter's food intake so she can gain weight. Is there such a thing? Here's the back story: She developed atypical anorexia at age 14 and began FBT shortly after turning 15. At age 16, she seemed to be stable and doing well in recovery, even though she was a little short of the goal weight. Unfortunately, her anorexia has become a pro at fooling herself, us and her therapist. We just found out she's been hiding food and skipping breakfast for months. She's now losing weight again.

To complicate matters, she's hyper-metabolic with multiple food sensitivities. I'm so tired and frustrated and overwhelmed by this disorder. I fear what will happen if she can't fully recover by the time she turns 18. That's less than a year and a half away. We're going to run back into therapy ASAP, but I need a way to make sure I'm getting enough calories in her to help her gain weight. Any advice?","Hi km92653, welcome to the forums! We’re sorry your daughter has been struggling, but we are so glad you’re here. Unfortunately, we had to edit some of your post as it included numbers of pounds, meals, and snacks which are not allowed on the forums. Additionally, users are not allowed to promote outside treatment/recovery tools, so we are unable to recommend what you are looking for. You can read about these guidelines here: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/forums/community-guidelines. We hope you understand, and again, welcome!","That's OK, I really appreciate any guidance.","I think you should enroll her in s higher level of care, ie hospital,  residential treatment,  day programs.  Unfortunately,  loved ones aren't always equipped to be able to truly be able to fully help a sufferer the way they need.  It sounds like having more professionals involved could really be helpful.  I'm sorry she's struggling, but recovery is possible. I struggled for 30 years, and I've finally recovered may 29th.",Thank you for the advice and encouragement.

She does not have an eating disorder.  But as I did, I understand the adjectives I used in showing understanding for those who feel so helpless.  And the fact that my sister isn't thinking clearly because she is malnourished and is so sick.  I want her do more to help herself before the ambulance has to come to the house and it is a crisis, instead of being more proactive, but as you said, we have to allow our loved ones make their own choices  and pray for health and healing.

She developed an ED this spring, made worse by the COVID quarantine. We are looking for a facility that has residential and inpatient care and can also help with her other conditions.

She is 18 so the decision to go (and stay) is hers. We want to make sure we find the place that is the right fit. ","Hi there, My daughter has been in treatment for depression and anxiety for years.

42,06/08/2020,Newhere-seekingadvice,"Hi All-
I am new here and really struggling.  My 17 y/o daughter has not been medically diagnosed but we are just so distraught over what to do for her.  She has been to therapists who have not really helped.  She won't admit there is a problem to anyone and believes we are crazy for thinking there is!  Her ED seems complex to me.  She sometimes binges, sometimes just doesn't eat, drinks excessive amounts of water and exercises excessively. SO much of her day is spent around obsessing of caloric intake and exercise.   The quarantine has not helped at all.  She has never weighed less than she does now, and she has always been petite. We notice some physiological symptoms in addition to her behaviors.  She is always cold, sometimes gets that blueness in her lips and hands that goes away, some fine hair noted on her skin, periods on and off.  She had a grand mal seizure in January for the first and only time in her life.  All neuro testing and cardiac testing came back normal but part of me wonders if an ED had anything to do with it.  It was a terrifying experience and I am just so afraid of something happeneing to her.  She is athletic which makes things more difficult especially with the exercise component.  I've been looking into treatment programs and found one that has inpatient, PHP and IOP.  I can't find any substantial reviews on it.  She refuses help and sure as her parents, we can force her there but will it work if it is done under full protest? Like if she can't acknowledge there is an issue, will it help?  I'm not even sure what I am necessarily asking but needed to share with someone who might understand.  Thank you for listening....","Hi there mjherman0712 - welcome to the forums.

Sounds a lot like my daughter.....she is now 21 and recently completed several months in a residential treatment program (praise the Lord it worked really well).  Unfortunately, it was a long long road (3 years) getting to the point where my daughter ""signed up"" to go to residential treatment.  She missed a year of college over it, and that finally motivated her to seek treatment.  Now she is in a much better place and poised to return to school (pending Covid shutdowns, of course!).","Sorry to hear about your struggle with your daughter.

You can make help available, but you can't force someone to get better (at least that is my experience).  Make sure to take care of yourself too!","Thank you so much for your support.  I am so glad to hear your daughter is doing well.  It's like a yo-yo here. Up and down days.  She still will not acknowledge there is an issue.  I am actually taking her to her MD this week. I plan to speak to the doctor ahead of time because at our last well visit, things were not where they are now.  She definitely needs some blood work I'm sure.   Like you said she needs to want the help that is being offered. ","Thank you so much for your support.  I am so glad to hear your daughter is doing well.  It's like a yo-yo here. Up and down days.

We are all quite emotionally vulnerable right now.  I really hope the doctor can offer some insight.

43,08/09/2020,DaughterrefusestoadmitherED,"Hi everyone...advice needed please! My 15 year old daughter has been dealing with her ED for over 2 years. She’s been anorexic, bulimic and at times, both at once. She’s been in an outpatient and residential program and neither worked. We have found yet another residential program for her to attend to see if another approach could help. She’s very much against going. Doing nothing is not an option however. My question is..:do I send her anyway? She’s in deep denial that she has a problem. She will hate me for sending her and there’s a good chance she won’t do the work and will come home the same but I have to try dont I?","I'm so sorry for what your daughter and your family is going through - ED's are just awful. I only have the perspective as someone who has recovered from an ED, but my mom never gave up on me, and I will be so grateful for that always. Until your daughter really can admit she has a problem, however, it will be difficult for her to recover. Does she have a good ongoing relationship with a therapist or psychologist in addition to the treatment programs? I don't have much more advice other than that - my heart goes out to you and I'm sending you and your daughter healing vibes. <3, STP","Hi lcrippen, ","Hi lcrippen, I am sorry things are so hard for you guys right now, it must be so difficult to feel powerless. I wanted to share the parent toolkit that NEDA provides, which hopefully can help you talk to your daughter and find a way to get through. Here is the link: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/parent-toolkit
You can also call the helpline as well for more advice! I am sorry I cannot offer more, but I’m sending you good vibes and love to you both.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,07/08/2020,Mysonhasstoppedeating,"I am very worried about my son who has stopped eating, lost weight and become emotionally withdrawn.","Hi, I'm sorry your son is going through this, it sounds like it must be painful to see him suffering. Have you tried talking to him about it? I don't have kids, but as someone who went through ED as a teenager, I know how hard it can be to open up to parents about these things. Maybe bringing up your concerns gently without commenting on body size or anything (as that can be triggering, it was for me), and just saying you're worried about his behaviors could help. He might not be receptive, as those who are stuck in the ED mindset often resist fiercely to any suggestion that they may not be well, but NEDA has some great resources for parents of those struggling you may want to look into as well. Wishing you both well, -Elizabeth","Hi bmsteadman, we’re sorry to hear that your son is struggling. We encourage you to reach out to the NEDA Helpline, which is available for information surrounding support and resources. The helpline phone line can be reached at 1-800-931-2237 (Monday-Thursday 11:00am-9:00pm, Friday 11:00am-5:00pm EST). Helpline chat hours are Monday-Thursday from 9AM to 9PM ET and Friday 9AM to 5PM ET.  Please continue to reach out to the forum for support as well.

","Hello.  Welcome to the forum.  I am so sorry to hear of your daughters struggles and how it affects you as her parent.  I am mostly in recovery but still have days that I struggle.  But far more into recovery than out of it.  I just wanted to start this off with positive encouragement and to let you know that I understand.  The eating disorder I had was serious and if it was not for God and my faith and the love and support of my parents I would not have made it.So about your daughter.  I am not a professional so I can't give medical advice.  I would recommend going onto NEDA's web site where they have what is called a parent's tool kit.  It is quite involved and gives information on the various forms eating disorders take place, it provides help in how to help a child, things that you can say and things that need to be avoided.  NEDA also has an information line or help line where you can chat or call.  From what you are describing your daughter very well may be developing an eating disorder.  But I can not say absolutely.  I think I can say that it might be helpful to bring her to the doctor and have a check up where they can do blood work and make sure everything physically is okay.  I also think having someone to talk with for yourself can be helpful.  It is very difficult to see a son or daughter regardless of age suffer.  Is your daughter in any kind of therapy?  If you talk with NEDA or read through the tool kit, it may provide you with ideas on how to interact with your daughter and boundary setting.  The sooner she gets help the better chances of recovery are.  She may say there is nothing wrong but that may be a defense mechanism because of the fear that getting help means she loses a sense of control.  Eating disorders are very dangerous and can be life threatening.  I do not say this to scare you but to encourage you to do what will help your daughter the most.

Thank you for responding.  Your perspective and insight is very helpful.  I'm calling her pediatrician today. I also picked up a book for parents on eating disorders to educate myself.  Silly question, do I read it publicly like I would any other book or keep it to myself?  I picked up on my daughter comparing herself to others and she seems to have this ""ideal"" of how she should look.  It's heartbreaking to watch this struggle.  I'm happy to read you are in a better place...keep up the good work...you matter in this world!!","Good morning,","Good morning,I hope you are doing okay and through all of this are taking care of yourself while taking care of your daughter.  It is a scary thing to go through.  About reading the book, I would do what you feel comfortable with.  There is unfortunately a stigma that comes sometimes with illnesses that emotional.  But saying that I feel that it is okay to read such things in public and to not have to hide or be ashamed of the illness.  If you think it may  upset your daughter though  I would think it best to read it at home.  But ultimately you are going to have to decide what you are comfortable with.  Also, the parent's tool kit here on the NEDA web site is very helpful and has a lot of information.","Good morning,I hope you are doing okay and through all of this are taking care of yourself while taking care of your daughter.

Thank you for checking in...

If you want you can take a peak at some of my posts under maintaining recovery to see the issues I am having with my sister and my roommate.  It is too much to go into again.  But I will with God's help continue to forge ahead.  Thanks.","Hi.  That is really good news.  I am really happy for the both of you.  Yes, let's pray that this is a good thing and it continues.

49,03/18/2020,newchallengeswithcoronavirus/support,"In light of the coronavirus, I expect that there may be new challenges for those out there with an ED. For example, with gyms closing, my 23 year old daughter is finagling whatever she can to get her exercise addition fix. She did manage to find one that is still in operation. Shame on them. It's hard to believe that gyms are not required to close as the bars and restaurants have been required. I'm guessing the struggle is real for anyone with an addiction at this point; no casino for the gambling addicts, no gyms for the exercise addicts, no bars for the alcoholics, etc. Just thought if anyone wanted to share struggles they are presently experiencing with the onset of this virus, perhaps we could support one another.... Warmly, Brokenhearted","Hi there.  I am sorry for the pain you are experiencing with your daughter.  It is very difficult. I had an eating disorder for thirty years.  I was sicker than I even remember.  People and my Mom tell me of how fearful they were of my dying.  But thanks to Jesus and my faith, and finally my desire to serve God, I am well and no longer consider myself to have an eating disorder.  My life verse is ""I will not die but live and declare the works of The Lord"".  Psalm 118:17.","Hi there.  I am sorry for the pain you are experiencing with your daughter.  It is very difficult.

I thought I couldn't live out in the real world, and I had to hide in programs and long term facilities.  But I now know different.

We all need to help each other in our families and circle of friends in order to get through this.  Those who struggle with an eating disorder may have an especially difficult time as you said, the gyms are closed and work places are shutting down, and social gatherings are being limited.  We need to lean on each other.  As for your daughter, does she talk with you about her fears and concerns?  Are you able to talk with her and share together?  This may help her if she is able to talk.  I don't know where she is at or the level of her illness, but being stuck inside for hours at a time when we are used to being out is difficult.

I hope your daughter gets the help she needs.  It took me way too long to get well and stop hiding in and out in hospitals.  I thought I couldn't live out in the real world, and I had to hide in programs and long term facilities.  But I now know different.  I had a set back in November but for several years I have been doing well.  I still deal with anxiety and some depression but eat anything I want and am happy.  Yes, I am happy.  As far as the virus and being inside, I am quarantined, have been for a week or so, and will be for another two weeks, at a great minimum, I am having to turn to my faith and know that the bracelet that I wear: Jesus Is Enough, that I am now really being put to the test.  I am a soldier in the army of Jesus.  He is my Rock.  This is how I am dealing with this virus and being homebound.  I am not saying it will be easy but I know Jesus will help me.   We all need to help each other in our families and circle of friends in order to get through this.  Those who struggle with an eating disorder may have an especially difficult time as you said, the gyms are closed and work places are shutting down, and social gatherings are being limited.  We need to lean on each other.  As for your daughter, does she talk with you about her fears and concerns?  Are you able to talk with her and share together?  This may help her if she is able to talk.  I don't know where she is at or the level of her illness, but being stuck inside for hours at a time when we are used to being out is difficult.  At this point I am  rambling. If you want to chat again, I will look for your post.","Hi there.  I am sorry for the pain you are experiencing with your daughter.  It is very difficult. I had an eating disorder for thirty years.  I was sicker than I even remember.  People and my Mom tell me of how fearful they were of my dying.

I certainly buy into Jesus being an important piece of recovery for anyone and am so glad that your faith has had such a great impact on your life.  In my daughter's situation, she has always been a believer, attends services and really hears the messages, reads scripture, devotions, etc.  Unfortunately, ED's/addictions seem to have the ability to takeover a person's judgement ability, overpowering everything they know to be true about God and his word.   Knowing and believing and praying for a healthy existence is part of my entire family's life, but accepting that healing isn't going to happen on our time, is the hard part.  I recently see some improvement in the ED, with less restrictions.  Unfortunately, the control issues are still there and she is seeking this control in other dysfunctional ways. As a teenager, she was the perfect kid- good grades, excellent athlete, never in trouble, didn't party, etc... Went to college and all hell broke loose, managed to graduate with a business degree while playing college sports, but seems stuck in this world of self-esteem seeking. I am living with an unpredictable, deceitful, self-destructive teenager at 23 years old that thinks that she is invincible, although I am grateful that she is not off living on her own through this.  Feeling abandoned by her father after our divorce 3 years ago, has contributed to the situation I'm sure. FYI, this all began in 2018, have attempted some treatment, including PHP, IOP, ... refuses any intervention at any level at this point... In a nutshell, she's stuck and so am I.  Thanks for listening.  Now I'm rambling. I enjoy our discussions... would love to hear more from you.","No matter how strong someone's faith is, they can still be struggling with putting their faith in GOD.  I'm glad to hear there has been some progress made. I'm sorry your family is going through this.   I myself struggled for 29 years, and just this past December,  I FINALLY beat it.  You are in my prayers.","Thank you for the prayers.  I honestly feel they are helping... I can't imagine 29 years of this!  Thank you and iwanttolive for supporting others going through this.

You have been through quite the journey and I really respect your advice/reflections.  Thank you for reminding me how God plays a huge role in all of this.  Since the last time we communicated, my daughter has made some significant improvements, but what I see her struggling with now is self-acceptance regarding the improvements. For example, she is asking for my opinion on what I call improvements and what she refers to as ""disgusting"".  Any advice on how I can help her with self- acceptance/comfort with her improvements?

Unfortunately, the average medical Dr. is poorly prepared for EDs.  The prepared ones are usually employed at treatment facilities!
Also, at this point it is hard to get in to see anyone unless it's a dire emergency.  The symptoms she is having are considered normal and should subside according to what I read.  I feel like getting on a scale at the Dr. office and having a Dr. that does not understand her symptoms could be worse than not seeing a Dr.  I am keeping a watchful eye on her and since we are both home at this point, I am with her throughout most of the day.

I know this was from God as I lived decades wanting to die on a daily basis.  I could not fathom another week let alone another year, or five or ten.  Death was more appealing.  But then I realized God wants me around for His glory.  For me to share Him with other people.  I no longer have this insatiable hunger for death.  Thank You Jesus.  I want to live.  I want to have less struggles, but I am willing to have them if it means I am able to continue sharing Jesus with others. If it weren't for Him I wouldn't be alive.  So this is a favorite.","So, this is my third time trying to write this out.  Psalm 118:17 says ""I will not die but live and declare the works of The Lord"".

50,04/11/2020,Hidingsomething,"Our daughter is 19, and has been fighting anorexia for the past 3 years.  Sometimes when she’s eating a meal we catch her hiding food in a napkin or somewhere else. Typically she denies it, which I understand is how the eating disorder voice will tend to operate.  I’m not sure if it’s best to confront her about it or let it go. When we try to confront it turns in to denial and often a fight. If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.","Oh brother, this hiding food thing is really common.

If we're doing the right things to help them. If we're doing the wrong things. Too much. Too little. It's so hard to know. The good news for you us that your daughter is working to recover. The other side of the story is that recovery is not a straight line. There are many ups and downs, steps forward and steps back, bumps and curves along the way. Please keep posting here about you and your daughter's journey and others are likely to respond and share as well.","Hi kerrypat, It is great that you're reaching out about your daughter and looking for support. Just a reminder that contact information cannot be given out on the forum, but as the user below suggested, this forum is a great resource for support in itself. Also, if you're interested, you may contact the NEDA helpline at 1-800-931-2237 for information on how to find support groups in your area. Thanks!","Hi kerrypat...my daughter is 15 and was recently discharged from an inpatient program. Like you I continually wondered if I was doing too much, not enough, questioning myself constantly. We always had a good relationship, but I learned that sometimes I had to breathe and listen.

We have no therapy in our area so we have to travel 350 miles round trip to see her therapist and dietican.  The best we can do is every other week, we pay out of pocket as non take our insurance.  So travel, gas and therapy costs are intense.  My daughter is not follwoing her meal plan and I feel like we're slipping babck into our old routines of eating only frutis/vegetables, no fats, carbs or sweets, etc..  I am at a loss.  We are going to try family therapy in June.  Her therapist just emailed me that if she does not start following her meal plan she will have to refer her to a higher level of care wich in our case means back to treatment.  I feel like i'm living a nightmare and I can't wake up!","HI! I would love to talk with you if you have time.

to spend five days in a facility while over break.  We allowed her to go back to school but we had
to go and pull her out 3 weeks later due to her condition worsening.  She is living at home with us now and we are trying to find her a therapist and most of the ones that are recommended are not taking new patients.

I've never been involved with something like this so I don't really know how to go about helping her with it.  We have a 16 year old daughter that is autistic and is very sensitive to this situation.  My mother also lives with us she has her own issues with food as well but refuses to admit it.  Needless to say, we are all walking on eggshells and the stress of her situation is starting to unravel the very fabric of our family.

It's hard to believe that gyms are not required to close as the bars and restaurants have been required.  I'm guessing the struggle is real  for anyone with an addiction at this point; no casino for the gambling addicts, no gyms for the exercise addicts, no bars for the alcoholics, etc. Just thought if anyone wanted to share struggles they are presently experiencing with the onset of this virus, perhaps we could support one another....

52,02/25/2020,Needparentaladvice,"Hi, I ‘m new to this community but not new to ED.  My dd has engaging in behaviors for 5 years, been in residential 2x-the most recent was this Jan. She went in under her own will(she’s 19), but left AMA after 30 days. She suffers from bulimia and periods of anorexia.  She was wanting to get better when she left res last week, saying she was just very lonely there and that was her reason for leaving AMA. She is in IOP now (started last week after a day home) and individual therapy but there’s always a reason why she can’t go.  I am Just so sick of living in this world. I know shes engaging in behaviors again because the upheaval has already begun in the house. The combativeness, the inability to have any conversation that isn’t 100% positive and rainbows and ends with her arguing, blaming and then isolating again.  I just Don’t know what to do. She quit her job before she left for res because she was too ill and it wasn’t safe. She doesn’t go to school because of the anxiety. She has no friends (LITERALLY) because she has pushed everyone away. There’s not one consequence that I can think of to make her go to iop and therapy because there is nothing left. She has no money, no car and depends on us 100%.
Please help with suggestions. I’m open to ANY!  And also would just like support and to know I’m not the only parent suffering like this. My friends don’t understand because they have never lived with a child or anyone really that has an ED.   Thank you for listening.","First, let me just say you aren't alone.  I hear you, and I understand a lot of what you are saying.  I have a 20 year old daughter that is ~4 years into ED.  The ""upheaval"" in the house, pushing friends away, and insensitivity to consequences...…...check, check, and check.  The things we have working in our favor right now is she desperately wants to get back to college, and she does have a job.  Life with 3 teenagers is stressful enough without this lumped on top.  My wife and I are trying to balance work, life, aging parents...….it all takes a toll.  So here is my one piece of advice...….make sure to take care of you.  Find something you enjoy to help you keep your sanity.  For me and my wife, it is going to the gym or walking the dog (which, ironically, is also a stressor b/c our daughter gets upset when she can't go also).  Our kids need to chose to accept help to overcome their condition.  All we can do is support them when they do, and keep our wits in the mean time.

She experiences burning in her throat, pain in her chest, stomach, fullness and sick feeling in her stomach, nausea but not able to throw up, she also burped lots.  She felt really distressful with the tube.  When offered the food, she is not interested at all.  Doctor diagnosed her as eating disorder, but I believe there is still an underlying issue going on that wasn't detected by the tests, but what's going on shouldn't really stop her from eating, is what my daughter experiencing considered a form of eating disorder?  Is eating disorder only limited to wanting to look good?  She is not the type of girl who wants to look slim.  I wanted to help my daughter but don't know how.  Should I get a second opinion on her fullness feeling?  She said the full feeling is not the same as a full feeling when you eat lots of food.  When she has a bowel movement, she does feel a little better. ","Hello,My daughter who is 10 years old has been having complaints of abdominal fullness since August last year.  It wasn't affecting her eating then.  Started in October, the complaint seemed to have grown stronger and she wasn't able to eat her school snacks, but still finishes all her food.  In December, it got worse to the point she started eating less at dinner and complaining she feels really full.  Dinner was a big struggle, she still managed to finish all her breakfast and lunch.  Up to January, daughter couldn't take any food at all, she says she feels really full all the time.  She is also experiencing constipation, she also experiences headache when she feels really full.  We have done all kinds of tests, x-ray, CT scan, endoscopy, ultrasound, upper GI test, blood tests, all have come back normal.  She was admitted to the hospital 2 weeks ago, tube feeding was started on her as she was malnourished and lost lots of weight over the months.  She is experiencing severe symptoms towards the tube feed.  We were told the symptoms should get better over time as she adjusts to the feed, but after a week, she is still feeling awful.  She experiences burning in her throat, pain in her chest, stomach, fullness and sick feeling in her stomach, nausea but not able to throw up, she also burped lots.  She felt really distressful with the tube.  When offered the food, she is not interested at all.

I struggled with orthorexia nervosa throughout high school so perhaps I can offer something that is somewhat helpful. I honestly look back and my parents didn’t really know what to do. My mom was so scared, I found out later she was sneaking stuff into my 'acceptable' food to increase the amount of calories. But otherwise, she did not push me towards eating any particular thing and for the most part just encouraged me to seek professional help I needed. I started seeing a therapist for the first time- and began getting at the underlying root causing my ED. It didn't happen overnight but over time, my need to cling onto ED behaviors became less and less. It is a process. But what ultimately led to my recovery was my own inner work- learning how to identify my emotions for the first time in therapy and beginning to develop my identity outside of the ED.

You can support her but it’s ultimately her fight. And it seems like she is on the right track with seeing a therapist & is putting in the effort. And it’s awesome that she is able to be open with ya’ll and will be super important in this process.Keep us posted on how your daughter is doing and how things are going. And be sure you are taking care of yourself as well & getting support as you continue to go through this with your daughter. Let me know if there’s anything else I can help with. Hope to hear from you again soon.<3 Lovetowrite81","So, Christmas break ended and she's back at school.  If I had to guess I would say that she lost a few pounds over the break.  She seems to be much better at school, happier and pretty open.  I don't think her food intake at school has improved.  She's still not getting enough calories and is working out with her sport which is excessive by non-NCAA athletic standards.","So, Christmas break ended and she's back at school.

The insistence on ""clean eating"" is putting her physical health in danger.  I try reason and logic, but it is usually a losing battle.  I watch her eat salads and drink water (in addition to other things of course) and then she is frustrated when she fails to gain weight.  Honestly, I don't know if she really wants to gain weight like she claims or if it is just the disease causing deception yet again.  Part of me feels like if she were sincere in her desire to get better and gain weight then she would accept the help.  But this is a very strong-willed kid, and a very stubborn condition.  I don't have any answers for you, but I can definitely understand your frustration and concern.","My 12 year old is in the same position.  after a 2 week hospital stay and inpatient and intensive outpatient she is back home.  It is very difficult to disagree with her as she eats so healthy most people when they see her eat would seem to think she is very healthy. They do not see all the time that goes into thinking about the next meal, the need to prepare her meal, the excuses to make when a restaurant that she does not agree with is chosen for dinner.  Its not even the amounts as she eats large meals and never leaves anything on her plate but gaining i still very difficult.  When we went over what a typical day of food would be, our therapist stated that this is what someone on a a diet would eat. It finally hit me, but still very difficult to add challenge foods, and for me as a father its difficult for me to decide to get into an argument to add a challenge food other than to let her eat her balanced meal.   Brutus94, I hear you when you say your not sure if she really wants to gain weight but she is always genuinely surprised when she does not gain weight.   She also suffers from anxiety which makes this all the more difficult.","I have a 22 year old daughter with ""orthorexia"".  Just under two years ago, my daughter, also a college athlete, began to lose weight during her sport season.  I paid an out of state visit to her to evaluate the situation that was brought to my attention by her roommate.  At that time, I didn't notice any big change.  A month later, her father paid a visit and he did not see anything alarming.  Her coach mentioned nothing to us.  When she came home for Thanksgiving, the weight change was visible and I took her to the Dr. for an eval as my daughter claimed that she was not ""trying"" to lose weight.  Of course, labs and visit were all fine.  I had a serious talk with her and nervously let her go back to school.
When she returned, she was in worse condition and I was frantic, as were my friends and family.
After naively deliberating about what approach should be taken, the athletic department and I agreed to let her return to school under the supervision of weekly Dr. visits, weekly therapist visits and bi-weekly nutritionist visits.  The plan was to dangle a carrot to get her to improve... that she would be able to train and compete if at a healthy weight.  Dr. was not happy with the slow progress and recommended hospitalization.  She spent 4 days in the hospital and was compliant, released and back to the same level of care. This was my window of opportunity to take her home and get her in the proper level of treatment and I didn't.  The ED demon convinced me that she could recover with this level of treatment and with that carrot dangling in front of her.  She has now experienced all levels of treatment except inpatient, with some improvements that never lasted. She has reported that she faked her way through every level of treatment that she has ever had. She has now graduated from college and we are back to square one. She has actually become more restrictive with her diet, leaving out an entire ""unnecessary"" food group. I used to like to call her illness orthorexia because it sounded more dignified than anorexia, but the truth is, it's a glorified word for anorexia and it's just as evil.  Her father and I are divorced and he doesn't recognize the seriousness of her condition, so all eyes are on me as far as what happens next with getting her to seek some kind of treatment.  I am praying that she hasn't comfortably nestled into this anorexic lifestyle and that there is still some hope for recovery.  As many of the other parents in this forum feel, I am haunted by this disease on a daily basis and just want my daughter back and for her to have a chance for a normal, healthy life.  At this point, I am praying for God to show us the road to recovery. I beat myself up each day, thinking things could be alot different if she had gone straight to inpatient treatment when she returned from college in rough shape.  From what I have read, the anorexic habits that were developing, along with the brain changes could have been treated before getting worse.  Maybe this information can help a newbie make a decision about early, intensive treatment from the get go...","Hello.  I am sorry to hear about your daughter.  I want to let you know that I am not a mother, but I have one.  I had a life threatening eating disorder for thirty years.  My parents did what every parent does, their best.  When a child suffers from a medical condition, there are usually clear cut answers from doctors as to how to go about a course of treatment.  Unfortunately not so with eating disorders.  There is a lot of confusion and not so good advice and not so good treatments out there.  I know most parent's second guess themselves and say.....if only.  Well, that is a really difficult way to live and blaming yourself isn't going to help you or your daughter.   I encourage you to try to accept the decisions you made as the best ones you could have made and that ultimately it is up to your daughter to choose if she wants recovery.  I know when one is malnourished the person isn't thinking clearly and when in an addiction making wise decisions such as choosing to get help is compromised, but it is still a choice.  I was afraid to get better and even though I was hospitalized twenty-seven times, some for a year, six months, four months, two weeks; and then the day programs, half way houses, I finally was able to commit to recovery.  I am fourteen months free from the disorder.  I owe a lot of praise to God for His help in getting me to this place.   And a debt of gratitude to my parent's who stood by my side for all those long and difficult and challenging years.  My Mom second guesses herself, if she had given me more ultimatums, if she had been more this and less that.  She did what she knew to do at the time.  Looking back helps no one and certainly not your heart.  It sounds like you really love your daughter and would do anything to help her.  That is loving.  May I ask, are you taking care of yourself now.  Living in the present?  Looking back with the If onlys….isn't going to help you. I am glad you reached out for support and hope your heart heals.

It was an unfamiliar feeling that left a pit in my stomach. What I would give to have my daughter back again...","I feel for all of you going through this.  Unfortunately, with all the ""healthy talk"" in schools and online, our children are getting mixed messages and I believe untreated eating disorders are the result.  My 15 year old son was a healthy eater and active sports player at 10 until his pediatrician reinforced that he was ""on the high end of the chart"" right in front of him not understanding the bitter feelings he already had for his muscular body.  He immediately lost an enormous amount of weight by restricting specific foods.  By the time we realized what was happening he stopped so we didn't seek any help.  However, low self esteem, OCD, and body dismorphism led him back to anorexia and last spring (of 2019).  When I called his pediatrician and explained he was fainting, had blue fingernails, rapid weight loss and extreme thoughts of depression, he saw that his ""number"" was still on the accepted scale (albeit low) and said he ""looked alright"".  Needless to say this did not help.  When I took him to an eating disorder clinic the next week they said the opposite.  His heart rate was low and he was in an extreme state.  However, his conformation was in two days, something he had worked for for a year, and he is a very spiritual person, and the medical doctor would not treat him there and wanted him to check into the local emergency room (where they do not specialize in eating disorders).  I knew this would traumatize my son who has an eating disorder BECAUSE of underlying issues and we left defeated.  I lost a really important window of help and now he is entrenched in this lifestyle.
     It has been a year and he has not gained any weight. I finally went to a therapist for myself and at her encouragement came ""clean"" to him that I was adding calories to his acceptable foods, but I didn't tell him the extent. My son and I have a great relationship and I feel constantly like a liar.  However, now I can see his body fat percentage getting even worse.  I finally have an appointment with a new doctor and pray to God that this doctor will see the health struggle we are going through for what it is and partner with my son to get him to see that what he is doing to his body is not healthy.  I feel like people reinforce his orthorexia all the time and this makes it harder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please take care! ","I'm so sorry to hear that your daughter had to go into residential and the fact she is dealing with this disorder, but at the moment I'm very sorry that you have to go through this too.. Coming from a daughter's standpoint, my mom knew about what I was dealing with and wanted to get me help, but knew there was nothing to do until I came to her asking for help. When I reached that point, I was at the lowest point of my life and needed the help from my mom and I think your daughter needed your help that night, she might not have been at her lowest then, but that was just for me. My mom had no idea what to do but to seek professional help and she had to make the choice of sending me into an inpatient facility. She has told me before how the night after she said yes to the treatment, she just cried and cried because I was going to be out of her care and she felt defeated for a moment. But if I didn't come to her at that moment asking her for help, or if she didn't decide on getting me the help I needed, I might not be here today. I always say everything happens for a reason, and sometimes we just need to trust our gut and go through with the plan and be grateful for the opportunities we have. My first step was coming to my mom then I got professional help, it was definitely hard at times, but recovery is going to have its ups and downs, but every step is worth it.

I am glad you posted looking for support.  I am sorry this happened.  Although I can not say for sure how things should have been dealt with, I would have felt better if it was discussed with you the parent's before talking with your daughter without you knowing about it.  I am not a parent but a daughter and my parents had to do a lot of advocating for me.  The doctor may have felt that your daughter is old enough to know what you her parents are thinking, but I would have preferred hearing it from my parents and not a professional as it would make me feel trust issues were involved.  You may be feeling some of these things.  What do you think about talking with your daughter when she calms down about what happened?  Ask for her input so she feels she has some control in the situation.  Also what to you think about talking with the doctor who was involved and maybe having a family meeting to figure all this out?   I really don't know much more and I really am not supposed to give advise but this is how I would and do feel when my parents talk without my knowing to any of my doctors.  But she is still a minor.  I am in my fifty's.  So it is different for me now.  But I was always very sensitive to my parents talking about me with any doctor even when the doctor said this was going to happen. I would get mad.  So.   What to do now....as I said, maybe talking with your daughter explaining why you did what you did...or having a family meeting to try to learn how to best deal with situations in the future.","Hi.

I've come to this forum many times seeking support and resources and it has been a tremendous help and I'd like to pay it forward.  A specific medication has given my daughter her life back for the first time in 17 years. I don't want to give you false hope, as different medications work differently for each person. It's very, very important to try a relatively high dose because lower doses are ineffective. And recent reports have shown that the medication is safe, despite earlier reports to the contrary. My daughter was addicted to bulimia behaviors and this is addiction medicine. It did not work overnight for her, it worked in an hour. I wish you and your family healing and joy.","Dear shesfree, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove specific medication and treatment provider names since they are not allowed on our forums.

I can't report a lot of food success from the treatment she has had but I can tell you she has improved a lot sensory-wise from a program for SPD. She participated in their OT and Intensive Feeding program around 2 years ago. It helped a lot but we couldn't maintain everything at home as my husband and I work FT. During our research we struggled to find an ARFID specific program for her due to her SPD/ARFID combo and her age(10 at the time). We are currently looking into a residential program but I do not know much about it yet. I do think the first program set us up for success now that we are looking at ED specific programs now. Good luck on everything. I hope you find a great program and update us on your son's experience. Sending good vibes from SC!!

62,01/19/2020,13yrolddaughterrefusingtoeat,"My 13yr old daughter has been having issues at school, with an ex friend targeting her about her weight, making comments, calling her names. Last september she stopped eating as she said she wasnt feeling well. Her blood sugars dropped and she was admitted to hospital. The drs put it down to viral as they couldnt find anything physically wrong (all her symptoms were things they couldnt really check-headaches, dizziness, blurred vision). She refused the syrup to get her blood sugars higher, and the nurses had to be quite firm with her. She eventually started to drink it.
All seemed to calm down at school for a while. Then before christmas quite a bit of food was vanishing and she denied it was her. I have found all the wrappers under her bed.
The girl has started making comments again now and my daughter is now refusing to eat. In the last week she has been eating very little. Another incident on friday happened and she is now refusing to eat anything at all. She is barely drinking. I took her to hospital last night. She was refusing but we managed to get her there. Her blood sugars are low, hands and feet are cold, headaches and tiredness. They were going to admit her but decided to let her home and said to monitor her, if she faints or goes dizzy to take her straight back, and to make sure she drinks as she isnt drinking enough. Shes now refusing water too. She is so emotional then switches to really angry. Its like theres just a shell of her at the moment. I just dont know what to do. The more i try and push even just drinking she refuses even more. She says it makes her feel better when she doesn't eat.

63,01/19/2020,Toddlerwithaneatingdisorderandinsuranceroadblocks,"Hello!
I am new to this forum, new to parenting, and very new to learning how to support my child through his struggles.
My son is 3.5yro and we've been fighting with him over meals for about 3 years now.
He recently was seen by the CHOP feeding and swallowing department and it was recommended that he be enrolled in their intensive feeding therapy program.
He often shows extream behavioral issues at meal times, including vomiting the moment non perffered foods get past his lips and forcing himself to vomit if pushed to take a bite of something he doesn't want.
He currently only eats about 12-15 foods in total.
Everyday feels like a struggle for him, and as bad as it sounds, I was very relieved that someone verified that he needed help.
However, it turns out our insurance company wont cover the therapy and there is no way we can afford it.
I feel defeated.
We are still fighting for them to cover it, but I dont have my Hope's up.
I feel ill equipped to handle this on my own and am looking for any advice on resources to help my little one.
I might also mention that he has Ketoctic Hypoglycemia, so his aversions to food and his unwillingness to eat do effect his overall health as well.
And it was recommended to us, that we should enroll him in play therapy to help him with some general everday anxiety.","Hi SLundbergRoth, we want to make sure you know the NEDA Helpline is an option to talk about finding resources.

She may die, but then we don't know when or if it will be today or next year.  It has been very difficult for my parents especially.  My father isn't coping very well with all he has had to endure with all his girls.  Five in all.  Four of us are on disability.  As I wrote in a post today, he and my mother have had to deal with their children's spouses and boyfriends abuse, physically, emotional, verbal and sexual assault as well as a grandchild being taken away from their daughter, my sister, when he was two.  That is an entire story in and of itself.  There is suicide, and violence and on and on.  Then dealing with the eating disorder that nearly took my life and the decades they fought to help me overcome it.  I still struggle with things, especially as things escalated with my sister, and then my moving in with them about six months ago.  My father isn't coping very well and is very shut down emotionally but using some poor coping behaviors that have me concerned.  He is angry and doesn't want to admit that he is scared about the possibility that my sister, his daughter may die.  The family has not been in communication with another sister/daughter going on six years now, until she realizes she needs help, but then there again, he says he is fine with this and life goes on.  He holds very strongly to the fact that he just doesn't need to feel, he just moves on.
I don't know if you  as a father would have any perspective on this or if you might give me some ideas in how to support my father as he goes through this.  He gets angry with me, tries to control me and when we have discussions he needs to control them or else and he gets very defensive.  One confusing thing is that my parent's want me to follow my therapists advice, unless it pertains to them and what goes on in their house where I live, or in the house where I was living with my sister, and will be going back to eventually.  It is three houses away from theirs.  My Dad owns both and we pay rent to pay the mortgage.  I love my Dad and he loves me but he is burnt out.  Cooked.  Really tired.

I just need a father's perspective of having gone and going through serious daughter issues and how I can help my father.  Thank you either way.  I understand if you are unable to respond.  I hope things with your daughter are a little better.  Did she go to college?  How is she doing?   Take care.iwanttolive","Hi.  It has been several days since I posted.  I wanted to let you know that my mother spoke to my Dad about his use of alcohol and how it isn't normal for him to be using it as much as he has and he agreed and they are working on that together.  My Mom didn't say I was concerned but that she was and wanted to let him know.
I decided to move back to my own home three houses away.  I was living with them for six months or so and I know he needs his owns space back. He needs his home without me there and I need to be back home.  Neither choice is optimal for me but it is time for me to be back in my own place.  I chose to move and then tell my parents.  My father came home while I was in the process and  I told my Mom after I moved my things back to my house.  There was no problem and neither one of them were upset with my decision.  It is the best thing for my father to have his own house back.","Hi.  It has been several days since I posted.

I get some seasonal depression in the winter, and exercise is key for me.  If your dad is still active, something as simple as going for a nice walk everyday coyld be a huge help.

65,01/09/2020,Ourdaughterlostthebattle,"Hello,
I am new to this site and only found out about it through the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC). I never really cared about what to donate to until now. We lost our daughter just a few weeks ago from complications with her bulimia. She had been fighting valley fever for about a year and a half and due to being malnourished, her body could not fight it anymore. A healthy person can usually fight it off in about 2-3 months.
She was a beautiful 27 year old girl who was very talented at writing and drawing. She lived with us several times over the years and we had just moved her in to her own apartment in November. She has been fighting this disease for about 9 years. We have had her in many treatment programs over the years, none of which she liked but she knew it was necessary. She did have dreams of success and had dreams of becoming a mother. We had those same dreams for her.
My main reason for leaving this message is to help people become aware about how serious this disease can be. I am still mourning her loss and still in disbelief that I will never see her beautiful face, hear her witty jokes or her laughter, enjoy her big hugs, or get her birthday cards (which she always told me that I was the best dad in the world and I was her hero).
My wife and I are going to start an awareness group and start fundraising campaigns to shed light on the whole issue, in the name of NEDA. We were always just focused on her and if we had started something like this sooner, my daughter would not have liked that kind of attention.
For all the parents out there that is dealing with a child with a eating disorder, I want to encourage you, plead with you, not to give up and always try to get your children the help they need.
Sincerely,
welostdaughter","Dear welostdaughter, Thanks for sharing your daughter's story.

My 15 (now 16) year old daughter was diagnosed in October with atypical anorexia and after 3 weeks in hospital was moved to residential treatment.  She is improving greatly and we are getting ready to have her come home at the end of January.  We are unable to find a treatment facility for her to receive PHP level care that is near us in St Louis Missouri.  There is one center that takes adolescents but unfortunately does not take our insurance.  The cash day rate is not affordable.  She has already spent 10 weeks away from home.  Are there any alternatives to PHP level care that anyone can suggest?   I am a nurse practitioner and although this is not my specialty I feel like I could handle providing the structure she needs and build in her therapy, manage physician care, etc accordingly.","Hello all,I am new to the forum and really all of dealing with ED.

They got me help when I was your daughters age and continued to advocate for me over the years.  They got me on disability and Medicare because they knew it would be a long road and I am thankful they did.  I am not sure if I am allowed to mention this, but have you heard of Family Based Therapy?  It is where they teach the parent to help the child learn how to eat.  Basically taking over all food prep and meal times.  They have therapist that teach parent's how to do this.  There are also books on it, but it is best to work with a dietician and a therapist to help guide you along the way.","Hello.  I am so sorry to hear of your pain and your daughters struggle.

You worry that if you use this form of protection for your daughter that your relationship may go beyond repair.

That is the risk you have to take.  I can not tell you what to do.  She may decide she doesn't want to get better no matter what.  But I think it is important to find out why she doesn't want to get better.  What she is afraid of in getting better. What that means to her.  I would want those questions answered before the eating disorder takes her life.  Harsh words.  Takes her life.  But I think you are living with that fear and are fighting perhaps more than she is at this point for her to survive this.  Have the counselors said anything about this to you?

Honestly, the POA sounds like the ultimate sledgehammer that a parent can use to ""fix"" the issue.  But.....I think you nailed it when you said you acquiesced.  YOU acquiesced.  POA is no guarantee that she will actually participate in anything.  To be honest, I'm not even sure if a treatment facility would hold her against her will.  And if they did, they can't force her to do anything.  My fear isn't that she will hate me, my fear is that it will cause her to dig in deeper just to prove she can win the battle of wills.","You understand, my friend.

POA is no guarantee that she will actually participate in anything.  To be honest, I'm not even sure if a treatment facility would hold her against her will.  And if they did, they can't force her to do anything.  My fear isn't that she will hate me, my fear is that it will cause her to dig in deeper just to prove she can win the battle of wills.You also nailed it when you said that her mom and I want her to get better more than she does.  I really thought that we could bend her using financial leverage.  She HATES the situation she is in.......and yet nothing changes.  Currently, she is in denial and thinks she will be returning to school soon.  It is a complete lack of reasoning, coupled with an ability to excel academically.  Sadly, she is just not getting the help she needs.  I don't know if it is lack of ""will to get better"" or if we just haven't found the right resources, or both.","Hi.  How have things been going since our last post?  I think what you said about the two intersecting intruders here are the not wanting to get better for whatever reasons, and the not getting the right help both work hand in hand.  For me, for decades, I did not want to get better even though I told people I did, told myself I did, and went into hospital after hospital.  I was afraid to get better.  To be an adult.  To be independent.  Fear of not being able to support myself, work enough to support myself.  Hold a job down.  Fear of men and relationships.  Fear of being me.  So many fears.  Then through a miracle,  was healed at a women's retreat.  This was fifteen months ago.  Before then, I was working on recovery, but fifteen months of very little use of behaviors.  Some overeating.   Due to enormous stress and dealing with the abuse by my sister and the fact that she is seriously ill and face the fact that she may die, I did overeat for about two weeks.   Overall I am doing very well.  Still not totally independent, but that is okay.  Interdependence is much better.
So.  There are some valid reasons people are afraid to ""let go"" of the destructive eating disorder.  For me, I have been able to trust God and talk with my Mom and some friends and am reaching out to help others, which helps keep me in check.","Hi.  How have things been going since our last post?

Wow, the time we can spend wrestling with that one.You are a spiritual person, so I will share just a bit more since we are as well.  I know God can save her, but I also know He promises salvation and nothing more.  No guarantee of a long prosperous life, no guarantee of a miracle cure.  And I need to accept that, because salvation alone is enough.  So for now, I guess I am really praying that God moves her to open up and be honest with someone about her feelings, to confront the fears, to have the difficult conversations.  We are also working to find another counselor/therapist that may connect better and achieve this goal.  Because I am convinced until that happens, no amount of arm-twisting, financial bribery, or verbal persuasion by me is going to move this child forward........and certainly not at the speed I would like.  It is likely she will be home again spring semester, but we will see.","Hi.  Thank you for sharing.  I really understand what you are saying.  God's perfect will and permissive will.

It the eating disorder has broken trust, caused friction, hatred, do what you can do to heal.  Your child most of the time isn't doing this to hurt you but she is lost and hurting and suffering.  There may be anger.  Hateful words.  Dishonesty.  This is difficult.  I know and understand.  I just want to say that after decades of being sick, I am now able to be on the other side and see what I did and how much it hurt my parent's especially my mother.  I love my Mom.  She is my friend.  My hope is that you can see past the behaviors and see your child as a person.  Not an eating disorder.  Look at her in her eyes and let her know you are there for her.  She may reject it at first.  Keep at it.  No one is hopeless.  Don't give up hope.  ","Hello.   My name is iwanttolive.  That is my user name and is very significant because I didn't always want to live.  I very much wanted to die. I was very ill.  I was just talking with my mother who says she suffers from PTSD from living through my illness.  She just told me how she was thankful for when she checked on me that I had a warm body.  How terrified she was of my self harm and not knowing if she would get a call from the police.  How fearful she was of the nights I would walk the streets fearful of me not making it home.  The thing is is that I never realized how sick I was.  To this day I don't remember being that sick.  I was hospitalized twenty-seven times, ranging from a year to two weeks.  Day programs, half-way houses.  I know how your hearts hurt, how you want your child of whatever age to be well. I want to encourage you not to give up on your ""daughter"". It may be a son.  I am now fifty.  I am walking in health.  I no longer self harm.  I do not engage in eating disorder behaviors.  But I know the pain and agony and fear you live with as my mother has been honest with me, about how scared she was.  And then again just a little while ago, she shared again, giving me a deeper revelation of how much she suffered during my illness.  The fear she lived with.  Not knowing if she was making the right decisions about how to handle me and what too do with me.  She told me just now that she was thankful I was warm.  How last night she saw someone walking in the dark and she had a flashback of me walking the streets in the neighborhood late at night, worried I'd be hit by a car or worse.  I didn't know the level of fear she lived with.  That you may live with.  Watching me self destruct while she was not able to help me.  I am sure there are some of you who can relate with what my mother went through.  On behalf of my mother I apologize to you for the pain I've caused.  The sleeplessness nights.  The fear.  Lost time.  I want to offer encouragement as well.  I am walking in recovery.  I have been recovered from the anorexia for at least three years, and the self harm and overeating for just under five months.  I know it isn't a long time, but I know it is real.  I have been going through some very difficult times and serious difficulties in recent months and have not had any urges to use any of my behaviors.  I know my faith in Jesus is a big reason for this breakthrough and healing, and the love of my parent's.  Without Their help, I wouldn't be alive.  I am living my life now.  I am happy even though I am going through a storm right now and have a level of depression and severe anxiety, I am also happy, or have joy.  I want to encourage you to share with your daughter how you feel.  Share if you are scared by her behavior.  How it affects you.  Not to shame her or make her feel guilty, but to let her know you love her and are scared.  My heart breaks for my Mom and what she went through with me, but we rejoice together now that I am well and am able to help others.  To offer Hope and say that even the sickest of individuals can get better.  I am living proof of that.  Don't be angry with your daughter.  But let her know you are there for her.  If you are able, let her know she can come to you and share how she is doing and what is going on.  It was hard for my Mom to hear what was in my thoughts.  My thoughts were sick and scary.

I celebrate this weekend.  So it is real and recovery is possible.  Never give upIt is now going into my fifteenth month of recovery, with a two months or so dealing with overeating, but not binging.  There has been a lot of stress and dealing with some abusive behavior with a sibling.  My home environment has not been easy.  Now my sister is probably going to be going on hospice in the near future.  All that being said, I have made choices to help keep myself on track, getting more support for myself and am back with my parent's for a while.  I say all of this to say that even during some very challenging times, I am doing what I need to do to maintain recovery.  With God's help.  I know you are worried about your children and adult children.  My parent's are dealing with health issues with my sister and have to learn how to help or not.  It is very difficult for them to know what to do and I know you must be feeling similarly with your children.  It isn't easy.  Loving them may be difficult or they may reject the love, but deep down they probably just want to know they are still loved.  I am not saying you don't, just from my experience I need to know my mom and dad love me.  And they do!!!  I am alive and well because of them and our mutual faith in Jesus.  Take care.

I am happy that my post gave you some Hope.  My faith in Jesus is my Hope.  Without Him, my parent's and myself would have never made it.  Your daughter is so young.  Is she getting into counseling?  That can be really important, even if you went with her initially to make sure the fit is good and then being able to know what is going on inside her that is causing her to turn to the eating disorder.  Family support especially at her age is so important.  She may respond with anger but know this is the eating disorder talking. The eating disorder wants to keep her and take her down, but your love and support will help keep that from happening.  If she rebels or gets angry, try not to take it personally.  I know it is difficult and painful.  I have seen my own parent's go through this with me.  It is very hard.  But that is why you also need support.

I love her more than anything on this planet, she is everything to me.  You are right, this dads heart is broken into two pieces, but I know its the ED and not necessarily my little girl.

Your daughter is lucky to have you.  You are already inspiring me so much and you are new to our community but welcome. You are right in saying that when your daughter says things and may yell and say hurtful things to you it is because she is scared. Scared that her only way of coping is being taken away from her.  But therapy will teach her better ways to cope so she won't need the eating disorder in the future.  That is the goal.  And as I have said, I had an eating disorder a long time before I realized it was hurting me and my family and I was not living.  It is possible to be free.  But it takes a lot of work on your daughter's part and the support of you and her Mom.  Your heart will mend in time.  I will pray for you and your family.  Thank you for sending out a prayer for me.  Things may look pretty bleak right now.   But that is for now.  Though tears may remain for a night, there is joy in the morning.  A verse from the Bible.

69,10/24/2019,WantingtoconnectwithotherparentsofteenswithARFIDandAnxiety,Hi:  My daughter has been struggling with anxiety since middle school and was diagnosed with ARFID just this past May.  I was just hoping to connect with oher parents out there who have been dealing with similar issues.  Its been a long road and things are improving but still would like the support and understanding or others who have been on a similar path.,"I have a daughter that is 3 years into ED and has anxiety issues.

70,11/03/2019,Needingsupportandguidance,"Hi I am marinewife35, i had suspected for a long time my daughter was suffering with bulimia. There were many signs and I have been very worried. I finally confronted her and she confirmed all of my worst fears. I am working on getting her therapy right now and she is totally open to it and not fighting me at all. My issue is she is supposed to leave for boot camp on Jan 14 2020. I talked to her about maybe going to the military (she is joining the Air Guard) might not be the best thing. She signed up before she graduated high school in May and has just been waiting to go. She said if she doesn't go she does not know what she will do. She has been waiting for this and I am afraid if she doesn't go it will make her spiral out of control. If the Guard finds out she has an eating disorder they will kick her out and joining the service is all she has been planning for. I just do not know what I need or should say to help her. I have suggested she also join a forum of people that are going through the same thing she is. She feels so alone and she says she is just exhausted constantly fighting the demons in her head. I was hoping to find support from other parents who are going through similar things. I just want to do everything I can to help her and get her well. Thank you.",Hello.  I just want to say that I am not a parent but someone who suffered with various eating disorders for a very long time.  I am doing well but sometimes things get a little difficult.  I hear your heart and your daughter is lucky to have you and your support.   It is really great that she responded as she did and is receptive to receiving help.  You may want to look into getting some support for yourself as it is difficult going through this journey.  I am not really allowed to give advice about whether or not your daughter should go for training.  I think she will need to have a physical though before the training begins.

71,09/22/2019,ComplacencyStage,"I have entered a new stage as a parent of a 22 year old with an eating disorder.  She has been through various levels of treatment that she has deemed worthless and any progress that was made, has not lasted.  She has graduated from college, lives back at home, actively job searching and working a low-paying job until an actual career comes along, making new friends and has a healthy social life, seems happy.  The illusion is that, although she appears to be functional, her physique shows otherwise.  She has no intention of seeing a therapist and avoids her Dr. at all costs.  Since I am the one she lives with, I know that everyone is waiting to see what my next move is.  Frankly, I feel ""stuck"", burned out from all that we have been through the past two years with this ED.  I honestly feel that unless she wants this for herself, any effort to coerce her to take some kind of action to get healthy is worthless.  On the other hand, I am very anxious about the possibility of something happening to her while I seem to have the caregiving role.  I feel complacent and helpless...","Hi.

73,09/13/2019,Daughter5thadmission,"Hi
I feel I need some more support so I’m here. My 29 year old daughter has been suffering with restrictive anerexia, PTSD, anxiertu and major depressive disorder for 9 years. She lives in Baltimore 90 minutes away. She is being admitted Monday back to a treatment facility for the 5 th time. I’m so depressed and upset. Twice she had to be forced to treatment by her therapist via the ER. This to she has been out of PHP for 4 months. She got a job part time as a contract therapist. She got her masters in social work while this has been going on. It was contractual so she was able to keep her Medicaid and disability. Just to back up she developed the ED sophomore year of college. Spent time inpatient twice but did manage to get her batchlers degree. Came home after graduation and had another stay. She is also suicidal. She went to Baltimore for a job and died pretty well. So well she was goof to study abroad a semester when she enrolled for her masters. Since June of 2016 it’s been awful. She has lost her friends. Her sister has nothing to do with her. Added to that her sister who is 4 years younger is living a charmed life. Bought a house, engaged etc. so we keep the same cycle for almost 3 years. Get sick stay in the treatment facility for months go home and then after a few months back in. This time she is telling me her out patients team knows she is only staying a week and will let her see her clients. I’m calling BS on that one. Probably saying whatever they need to to get her back in treatment. She won’t go anywhere else I’ve tried and she is limited with Medicaid.  She won’t listen to me anyway. I have no control at all. She isolates herself so I won’t know how bad she is. She is very concerned about my anxiety around her hospital stays. When she has been admitted it’s a shit show. She has 12 reptiles and a cat. We have gone in and taken care of everything.  I’ve learned from my support group not to take over and let her call the shots. I’m doing a good job this time but inside I’m falling apart. She is going to lose her job. It took a lot of convincing to get her to find a job because she didn’t want to abandon her clients. I can’t imagine they will keep her if she missed more then a week it two. I know all these details I should not be worrying about but I can’t help it. What’s goof to happen whensje loops her job, who will take cate of these pets etc etc. I know I should be happy sjebis seeking a higher level of treatment but is this ever going to end. I have health problems now. I’m trying to help my other daughter plan a wedding. We have financial issues from helping her.  Our friend and family are not any support anymore. They been there done that. We are alone  my husband tries but .... she won’t move back here and o no options. The ball is in her court and I have no confidence in her treatment. I’m worried she will kill her self over the weekend with the admission coming up Monday and I can’t do a thing. I feel like I’m falling apart. Any support would be appreciated toni","Hello! We are very sorry to hear that your daughter has been struggling. You mentioned that she is suicidal. We would like to pass on some resources. This number is really important to have: (800)273-TALK(8255). 
","Hello! We are very sorry to hear that your daughter has been struggling. You mentioned that she is suicidal. We would like to pass on some resources. This number is really important to have: (800)273-TALK(8255). 
We also would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove mentions of the name of the treatment facility, which is not allowed on the forums. You are using your email address as your username. Please send an email to [email protected] to change your username as we don't allow members to use their email addresses as their usernames for confidentiality reasons. We hope that your daughter receives the help that she needs. ","I am so so sorry to hear about the struggles you and your husband have gone through with the recovery process for your daughter. When I was going through my ED, my mom was my number one supporter and was there every step of the way, even when I absolutely despised her for trying to get me to start my recovery process. My mom is my number one best friend and she understands that throughout that time when I would be mad at her, if she wasn't there for me, I probably wouldn't be here today. So I do commend you for sticking by her side throughout this roller coaster, it takes a special person to go through that with someone else.
There has been some resources that I found useful from the NEDA website that I'll attach below that might be beneficial to your daughter and yourself. Always remember that we need to keep in check with ourselves and make sure our mental state is capable of continuing to help her, because if you're drained or exhausted, it'll be hard to give all the amount of energy you normally would.
I hope your daughter gets the help she needs and you and your husband continue to look out for yourselves. Keep in touch. <3

We've talked with her about getting into a nutritionist and been met with the comment of ""whatever, it doesn't matter what they tell me I won't listen and want to keep losing weight"".  We daily force her to eat whatever we can, and get met with resistance every step of the way.  We, as parents, have become just plain tired.  We've battled the depression and suicide (and cutting to make things a bit more complicated) for the last 6 years and felt that up till about 6 months ago we had some success keep her in a good place. Now this creeps up on us.  In the past I've been able to look out and see through it all and know ""we will get through it"".  This is the first time I have to say I can't see the end here.  I've become frustrated!  Between her actions in the past and now this I feel like we have our family life revolves around her.  We have two boys whom we've unfortunately had to push aside at times and ignore.  So I get frustrated, then feel guilty that I'm frustrated with her and the fact our lives can't be ""normal"" (whatever that is anymore) which then leads to me be mad at her and myself.Not even sure what I hope to get with posting this (first time posting on any forum for this).  May be just a great place to vent.  It's hard because there may be support out there but when crap hits the fan, it'sjust you (and your spouse) to wad thru these waters.  It's good to see others get some of the same emotions.  It's just good to know we aren't alone.","Hi bennys,","Hi bennys,First off, I wanted to welcome you to the NEDA online community forums.

75,08/07/2019,Daughterhomefromresidential.,"My 16 year old daughter is home from residential recovery. Step 1. We have a very wonderful therapist, doctor and dietitian in place. Now I am terrified. She's home and that is fabulous. Why am I so freaked? She was in the hospital for refeeding for 3 weeks and finished  residential program. On discharge, they told us that the relapse rate was over 65%.
This was not helpful.

I am really sorry for the struggle you are going through.  It is indeed a very difficult and painful journey.  I am sorry for what you were told about the relapse rate.  It is common for someone who has an eating disorder to need more than one inpatient stay, or partial hospitalizations.  The time in a residential or in hospital stay are often too short to learn to develop new and better ways of coping,  One of the goals is to weight stabilize and learn some skills, but then upon release if is true that relapses do occur.  It takes time and practice and therapy to learn the new skills taught and to learn how to accept a different body size.  I had a doctor during a group therapy session give me a zero percent chance of recovery along with another girl.  She did that to me once before with a twenty percent chance.  I proved her wrong and have been in recovery  for fourteen months.  I have recently been dealing with a critically ill sister and I have been eating more than  I would like, but recovery is possible and while your daughter may need more help in the future it doesn't mean she is failing, but growing stronger as she learns how to use her skills, how to learn to live in the real world, how to live without using behaviors.  To learn that in the end they don't really help.  But she needs to learn these thins as she grows and matures.  I am glad you posted and I just want to offer  you a little bit of encouragement.

The chances are that you will worry every time you leave her alone.
  The treatment provider telling you about the high relapse rate will certainly have worried you.  However.  As hard as it seemed, they were only being honest and trying to prepare you for the fact that her recovery is going to be a long journey.
  After leaving the treatment provider, your daughter may feel that she is on her own in trying to cope with her situation.  She is young and likely to be feeling nervous about trying to cope without being in the care of the treatment team.
  Even if she didn't like being in care, there is still the likelihood of her experiencing an element of security that has now been removed since leaving.
    You say that she has a wonderful therapist.  This is hopefully a very good start for her journey to recovery as one of the main issues is dealing with all the feelings/emotion that can be involved in her treatment.
  Having a good doctor on board is additional comfort for you in order to deal with the physical aspects of making sure your daughter is as fit and well possible.
  Then there is the dietitian to keep a close eye on what she eats and continue with advising her on her diet as she recovers.
  In all fairness, it appears that you have got everything she needs in place and there is really little more you can do but let the professionals help her.
  Just keep giving her as much encouragement as you can as the emotional support will be one of the most important aspects of her recovery.
  The treatment providers may have left you feeling somewhat disheartened with the '65%' relapse rate but they were just being honest and realistic.  Unfortunately.  There is no easy way to tell you - as a very concerned parent - about the true facts of your daughter's condition and treatment.
  Although - very understandably - you are worried and there are no easy ways to explain things or console you.  However.  With the support your daughter is receiving professionally and especially the support from yourself, your daughter will feel empowered to continue with her recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am so sorry you are going through this.  I am a daughter of two parents who both happen to be nurses.  I had a severe eating disorder and believe me, I understand what you are saying.  I ""knew"" everything.  I knew I wouldn't die from the eating disorder, that I wasn't ""that bad"", I knew that my self harm was not that bad, that I would possibly be able to die from that.  I was so smart.  I was x amount of pounds but I was fine.  No one could convince me otherwise.  The one thing I did do was go into hospitals to make my parents happy and because they were safer than living out in the real world.  The fear my parent's lived with.  I was always and honest ""Abe"".  That is until it came to how much I ate, or exercised, etc.  I never thought I would lie to my parents.  One thing is that I was usually open and honest with my therapists, but I was not ready to get better for many years and nothing anyone said made any difference. I was afraid to get better.  I am now fully in recovery for one year from all forms of the eating disorder and three years from anorexia.  I had bulimia for a number of years off and on but it was mostly the anorexia and binging.  So when you say all the yelling, convincing and wishing won't change her, that she has to be ready to want to change, unfortunately that is true.  One has to want to change.  One good thing is that she has acknowledged that something is wrong and she needs help.  That is huge.  Hold onto that Hope.  For me, my faith in Jesus was instrumental in my healing, as well as my parent's love and never giving up on me.  It makes sense to me to hold off on paying for more college if she is not well.

There are very few people in our lives that can truly understand what this is like, so to be able to hear from others with real experience is a helpful.  We really hope the tuition holdout is a motivator.  Since she is 19 now we are limited in what we can ""force"" her to do (ie, treatment, hospital etc), but we have also considered the idea of trying to get her to sign a medical power of attorney.  This may not be an area you feel comfortable commenting on, but if you are I would be interested in hearing pros and cons from those with more experience.  The tradeoff is us being able to force her into treatment that she doesn't want......it may be good for the short term, but in the long term that is really just us forcibly taking control and may result in her digging in further.  I'm not sure how far to let her fall on her own, and it is terrifying to think of some of the possible outcomes.","Hi.  I allowed my parents to have medical power of attorney over me for a while.  It can be a bit scary to do this, but I knew I needed help and they are both nurses and I knew they would not abuse the power....So, it your daughter is willing, or if her doctor deems her in need of someone taking over her medical decisions it may need to go through a proceeding of some sort for you to get the power of attorney if she doesn't willingly let you have it.  I don't know if it will help or not, because if your daughter is not ready to get well, forcing it may hurt your relationship. But at the same time, if she is unable to make clear decisions and is a harm to herself it may be needed.  I would see if you can talk with a counselor about this as well as checking with NEDA and get their opinion.  I am sorry I can not give you more of an opinion.  This is something you really need to talk to a professional about and as I said, NEDA may be able to give you their input.  I wish you the best and please let us know what you decide and how your daughter is.  I know it is painful and that your hearts hurt.  Love hurts sometimes.  Hang in there.","Hi.

Her friends from high school have all come home, and I suspect they are very concerned for her again (and perhaps disappointed, maybe even angry).  I avoid talking about it to friends and relatives because it doesn't really help and often makes me angry, like ""great idea gee, I never thought of that!"".  I understand what they are thinking..........she is such a great kid, and we are not bad/stupid parents.  So why is it so hard to fix?  That is a great question.....","Hi.  I am so sorry about your daughter not doing well in college. I know it is painful but college is so very stressful for a healthy person.  Throw in someone who is dealing with an eating disorder plus the issues one has to deal with that caused them to turn to needing the eating disorder.   For me, once I was able to trust Jesus with the fears that I had and allow Him to help me deal with the fears ( it took a very long time for me to be able to do this), but once I did I was able to recover.  I want you to know that she has to be ready to confront her fears and pain and then she will not ""need"" to use the eating disorder as a way to cope.  It will  still take work to relearn how to live without the behaviors but it IS possible.  For  me it was very quick once I handed my trust over to Jesus.  Even though I  have been a Christian for a long time, it took me actually  transferring over the baton to Him.  I have been free from all behaviors for a year in June.","Hi.

This isn't something YOU can fix, really.  Yes, set up boundaries and parameters.  No. She isn't going to like them or you probably.  It is more likely the fact that she is afraid that you are trying to ""take away"" the eating disorder from her and right now she needs it.  I know that sounds strange, how can someone ""need"" something that is so horrible and difficult to live with, yet there are always reasons.  Are you getting help for yourself?  Any parent going through this can benefit from getting professional help for themselves.  You seem to be doing a good job at doing everything you know to do to  help your daughter.  A lot of parent's wouldn't do what you are doing and this tells me you love her and want what is best for her and I admire that.  I know it is painful and you feel helpless.   Tell her you love her with words.  Daughters need to here that from their dads.  I know you love her and want  so badly for her to get well.  She needs to want if for herself.  Don't give up.

My daughter is 19 and we are currently in the lows of a 4 year battle with anorexia.  She actually checked out of her choice college after the 1st semester and went into her 2nd try at inpatient treatment.  As sad as I was, I was so relieved.  I had hope.  Two months out, she has lost 10% of her body weight and is emotionally, physically, and mentally a mess.  She is the oldest of 4 kids and it is affecting everyone. Currently she is registered to go to school at a local school and live on campus there.  It is 20 minutes away.  I have these moments of hope that she  will see the fun and future that she is missing...but my gut tells me she will hide behind her ED.  I don’t know whether to let her go to school or try another treatment facility.  Obviously, she would not want to go and we would have to get medical power over her.  She has a strong faith and to be honest I think she is so content with her ED thoughts she refuses to let Christ take over...she won’t let go.  Those in recovery...Did the tough love route work? No money for school? Etc?","Hi.  I am truly sorry for your pain and your daughters.  I am a daughter of two loving parents who did everything they knew to do to help me, but as so many say, it needs to come from the person with the disorder.   I am reviewing journals from a time when I was at a Christian program in New Hampshire that takes in all people who struggle with various addictions that take the place of Christ in their lives.  I am going over the journals in hopes of writing a memoir or short story.  I am amazed by some of the things I wrote.  I am so afraid of giving up this disorder, sin, to You Lord, I know I am  hurting You by hurting myself and not trusting You but I am terrified of living, of the pain of letting go.  I feel as though my fist is crazy glued shut but I want so badly to open up my hands and surrender this to You.  This goes on for months of this type of writing.  Pleading prayers to God of repentance, of knowing His way was so much better than mine, reading His Word and finding Hope in it; I will not die but live and declare the works of The Lord.  Psalm 118:17.  I had no idea God gave me this verse so many decades ago.  The fear of letting go of something so harmful because I was so afraid of what laid beyond it.  What if I wasn't happy after I let go of the eating disorder.  What if all the bad things happen to me that happened to my family members?  What if....I was so afraid of living.  And of dying.  But that is what I was doing.  It wasn't until a women's retreat last June, one year, that God freed me from all forms of the eating disorder and self harm.  It will be about three years from the anorexia and about ten or less from the bulimia.  One full year from all self harm which had gotten severe, and binging and overeating.  And intense fear of being a normal weight even though I had been weight restored.  At the retreat, I was able to finally surrender my fear to God.  To trust Him with the things that had me so afraid.  Of people.  Of growing up. Of being independent.  Of dating and getting married.  I have chosen to remain single at this time, I am 51.  I have single friends and am happy.  For the first time in my life I am happy and want to live.  I never thought I could say that as I was so depressed.  I told my forth grade teacher that I wanted to end my life.  This teacher did nothing and I got no help until the anorexia developed many years later.","Hi.

To offer Hope, Jesus to some and for you.  If it were not for Jesus, I would not have lived.  My Mom may not be who she is today.  It was scary for them, both my parents nurses, my dad on lay offs from being a pilot would do nursing when he wasn't flying.  I want to offer you Hope.  Jesus.  Lay your fears at His feet as your daughter needs to do the same.  When I did, Jesus took away even the desire to use behaviors and I have been behavior free from last June 6th or so until this day.  I still have pain, hurt, anger, physical pain, emotional pain, fear.  But I know that using behaviors will never make them go away and dealing with them with Christian friends and my parent's and my pastor and of course Jesus IS the answer.  Next Saturday I go back to the retreat.  I was actually in a hospital that Friday and I told the doctor I didn't need to be there, he agreed and I went to the retreat that afternoon and the rest is History.  I have come to say it is our story because without Jesus it wouldn't be a story.
I hope our story offers you some hope and eases some of the pain you are feeling.  Jesus holds all of your tears in a bottle.  It says that somewhere in the Bible.  He knows what is going on with your daughter, her fears, the reasons she is afraid to let go of what is hurting her.  Cry out to Jesus that she will learn to trust Him with these fears as I did.  I am no one special.  My journey was a very long and painful one.  But once I surrendered, He stepped in.  You need to surrender your daughter into Jesus hands tonight.  He knows your tomorrows.  He has her in His very capable hands.  I do not know what her future holds.  Only Jesus does.   Make sure you are getting support for yourselves and just let your daughter that you love her and if she wants to talk you will be there for her.  You are doing a good job.  You are loving her well.","Hi.  I am truly sorry for your pain and your daughters.

We advised her to attend a smaller college, but she wouldn't listen. The university was too big...not that it would have made any different, we think now. We can't reconcile the person she is now with the person she once was. No comparison. It's heartbreaking.

You want so badly to save the one that doesn't want saving, but that can hurt the others. Balance is important in these situations. I hope you enjoy Harriet Brown's journey with her daughter. She doesn't sugar-coat it. She has a blog that has since been retired where she addresses some of the hard issues on hospitalization. She advocates FBT (Family Based Therapy) which is what we have utilized. It has helped greatly. God bless you and your family in this journey.

I had a good conversation with a nurse at an ED clinic that explained the transition from the ""child"" model of treatment to the ""adult"" model.  The conversation made me feel like it wasn't all my fault, which I know, but sometimes it is good to hear it again.  Bless her heart she was so encouraging and uplifting...….it was a nice boost for me.  I just wish she would be more open minded.  I wish she could see how great her life could be if only she could beat this thing.","Hi.  I am glad that you are able to come here and vent and to get support.

Its heartbraking to read your stories. In my experience one can not wait around until the adolescence decides to get well. Parents are the biggest resource for recovery from ED.,"Heart breaking indeed.  I can't force my daughter to get better (we have tried), but we can encourage and motivate (no tuition assistance until you get the help you need).  She goes to counseling, she goes to the doctor, and she eats.  But there are limits to everything she is willing to do and as a result, she struggles.  So what is a parent left to do?  Obtain medical power of attorney (either by their choice, or by a judges order over their choice) and force her into a treatment facility.  Is that what you are suggesting?  Is your experience as a professional (dr, counselor, etc), as a parent/caregiver, or as an ED sufferer?  Her current counselor, who struggled with ED and self harm in the past, has told us and our daughter that she has to want to get better......us ""wanting"" it for her just won't work.","Heart breaking indeed.

We exercise and walk the dog (2 of our favorite stress relievers).  Unfortunately every time we do one of those things, it is a trigger for my daughter.  She wants to do those things also, but we have told her she can't until she gains enough to be out of the critical zone.  So doing what we enjoy can sometimes come with stress and guilt."

Her intestines are working again but not well.  She can not tolerate the feedings.  We are all very concerned and wish so badly that she had gotten help before it got to this crisis.

BlueMoon",Hello. I am the mom of iwantolive.  I can only imagine your pain.  It sounds like this is a situation of saving a life or not.  I only know that at this point your daughter is not in her right mind.  If you choose to do an intervention it will give her a chance of being able to think clearly and hopefully making wise mind choices.  Despair is ugly and paints a picture that is not reality.  There is no hope in the dark place of despair.  What are you willing to risk?  Have you thought about how you would feel if you did nothing?  It sounds like you have support of therapists who are encouraging an intervention.  I hear you asking if it will work....God has given each of us a free will which is a gift.  It is hard to see our loved ones use this gift to destroy themselves.  With God there is always hope.  I have had to surrender our daughters in various circumstances to our Lord and  trust Him in the process.  It has only been crying out to Him for direction that I have found peace in doing what I believed He showed me to do.  It is faith that brings us peace as we seek His direction.  I will pray for you to find the place of peace in your decision that only He can give you.  The complexity of life is what throws us into His arms.  I found my only Hope was in knowing that He is in the fire with me and to keep my eyes on Him and not the fire (problems) saved my soul.  Blessings and love from my heart to yours.,"Hi.

They will just tell you it isn't allowed and ask you to review the policy.As far as your daughter is concerned, I am concerned for you too.  It is so very difficult to watch a child suffer.  It is difficult to watch a sister suffer and I have been doing that for many years.  She recently had severe medical issues and has been in the hospital and will hopefully be coming home to a rehab at the local hospital for about ten days.  It is difficult to know what to do, what is enabling and what is helping.  My mother, the above post, has questioned herself on how she dealt with me and the severity of my problems.  She wonders if she were more strict, if she laid out more restrictions, such as if you continue to do this you will no longer be able to live with us, or at the house I now live at with my sister and a roommate.  My folks live three houses down.  She questions herself but she needs to let that go as I am in recovery now.  I think having an intervention is a good idea because as you said, it is a matter of life and death.  Once she gets nourished and she begins to think more clearly, because in a state of starvation, the brain is not capable of making any kind of decision at all, she will then be responsible for making her decisions. I went to a support group last night for people with addictions and asked the question about enabling verses helping.  Some said if one does something for another that they are able to do themselves, that is enabling. If a person doesn't take care of themselves, getting to doctors appointments, doing what the doctor says, and then asks for help and support, that is enabling.  For you, your daughter is not able to make any clear headed decisions.  Until she is able to, it is wise for you to intervene.  It may be that she will not want to talk with you again.  She may hate you.  But I believe that would be the eating disorder talking.  A lot of people with anorexia don't want it ""taken"" away from them.  It becomes an identity, a way to cope with pain, as with drug abuse and alcohol abuse.  It is a way of avoiding life, pain, fear, you name it.  ","Hi.

Your pain is palpable.  I am blessed to have God heal me and deliver me as He did one year ago.  At a women's Christian retreat.  Never give up hoping.  Hope deferred makes the heart sick.  Somewhere in Proverbs.  I am glad you trust her therapist.  That is really good.  Please let me know how you are doing and if you do do an intervention.  Do you know where she will go and are they ready to accept her?   We can't think as those without Hope.  God is able to work the impossible and breath His breathe into anyone's life.  He is Jehovah Rafa and El Shedi.  I spelled the words wrong, sorry.   But He is the God of the impossible.  So many miracles and they are still happening today, everyday.  Good night.","I am so sorry for your pain.  We will definitely keep you in our prayers.  Your pain is palpable.  I am blessed to have God heal me and deliver me as He did one year ago.

Jesus tells us that He will never let go of us, even when we have lost our way.  I am  confident that He is right beside your daughter, whispering her name.  She may be listening to other voices right now but His voice WILL prevail.  We don't know what tomorrow brings, but He does.  And He is faithful to His Word.  He will never leave us or forsake us. Even though your daughter isn't listening to Him now, He still has her.  So when you lay your head on your pillow each night, know that He has your daughter.  Lay your head down and rest.  Be at peace.  Jesus has your daughter.  Though the enemy comes to kill steal and destroy, rejoice for I have overcome the world...Jesus.  ","Hi.  Checking in to see how you are holding up.

There is just so much you can do. Old saying, ""You can bring a horse to water, but you can't make him drink."" That's where we are now. She doesn't want intervention. Thinks she got this handled. Believes that she is thriving. And you take one look at her and she looks very sick and malnourished. So, we pray. And we wait. We continue to encourage her to seek residential help. But she wants to try and lick this on her own. She's done it once before with help. Says she knows what to do, just needs to do it. So iwantolive, we are traveling with jourey in faith and hope...with lots of love for our daughter. Thank you again for reaching out to us. BlueMoon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,07/13/2019,Howtodealwithbehaviors,"Our daughter is 19 and living at home. She is in outpatient treatment, out of residential for a year. She has maintained weight, but it is still low. She had/has anorexia and her issue was restricting. Here is where I need help: she uses our credit card to go grocery shopping, and mostly we are just happy she is eating. But for the last several months, her eating has changed and she engages in behaviors, such as really only buying a few foods, which are not nutritious. Like she eats only three things, and one she eats with the freezer door open, standing there, etc. So I have suggested she challenge herself, but we are trying to just do meal support by eating with her, and that is the only support we are allowed to offer. Question: should I push her a but by saying we won't pay for groceries if she is not challenging these behaviors? Or should we do nothing?

During that time, she has been in two PHP programs, ongoing FBT (Family-based Therapy) with a nutritionist, psychiatrist, physician and therapist. The rollercoaster ride between successes and setbacks has been exhausting. Eight months ago, some of her friends convinced her that she didn’t need to be on depression medication and that she didn’t have an eating disorder, “she’s just small boned and skinny.” Due to peer pressure, she moved out of the house and that’s when she dropped to a dangerous level. Her therapy team says she needs to be in a residential facility. We are working on that. Meanwhile, her personality has changed so dramatically is frightening. She has disordered thinking due to malnutrition. She has now disconnected with us (her father and I) and the rest of the family. She no longer responds to text messages or phone calls. Because of her age, we can’t forcibly remove her from her apartment and place her in a facility, as many have acknowledged here. If she doesn’t want the treatment, it’s a waste of money and effort. Therefore, all we can do is pray and hope that someone somewhere will convince her to seek the help she deserves.

BlueMoon","Hello.  It saddens me to read your post.  I am a Christian and suffered with various eating disorders and self harm for thirty years.  My parent's never stopped praying.  I can somewhat understand how you feel as my Mom has shared with me what it was like for them to go through all those years with me and not being able to do much but have me go into hospital programs.  The difference with your daughter and me is that I number one-needed to go in as it was too scary for me to live in the real world and two, I allowed my parents to make me go even if I didn't want to, even as an adult.  I am sorry your daughter's ""friends"" have convinced her that she doesn't need help.  And you are correct that someone can not force another to want to get well, but being nourished and given the chance to be able to think more clearly can definitely help.  My parent's chose to keep me under their care, supporting me throughout the time I was ill. My mother sometimes questions whether that was the best choice and others told her to cut me loose and let me fend for myself. But she knew that I would not have been able to survive without their help.  Every parent has to come to that decision for themselves as they know their child the best.  I wound up after thirty years recovering.  Long dark scary days and nights did my parent's spend as did I.  Our faith sustained all of us.  Without Jesus in our lives we don't know what would have happened.  I know you are scared and even though you have done all you can do in the natural, you can continue to do in the spiritual.  For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds-demolishing strongholds against Truth...2 Cor. 10:4","Hello.  It saddens me to read your post.

The demon the illness, once she starts saying no to it then her recovery can begin.  For you, I encourage you to get help for yourself.  You need help and support while going through this.  I hope you are connected with a good church and have a church family that you can lean on, but also to consider therapy.  Maybe talk with a NEDA support person.  I am glad you posted and asked for help and support.  I am again sorry for the fear but try to keep handing her over into God's capable hands.  I wish there was a magic answer to take away the pain and for your daughter to just be OK.  Pray.  Stand your ground.  Stay close to God.  iwanttolive and I am","OMG! What a powerful testimony of faith, courage and perseverance. Thank you for taking the time to respond and offer your wisdom and experience. I am blessed by your willingness to share. We continue to lean on God. You are correct about ED and malnutrition. Our daughter is making unhealthy choices and can’t hold down a job. Disordered thinking it out of control. So out of character for her. I agree it’s her journey, but like your mom, I’m not willing to just sit back and watch her die before my eyes. We have lined up residential programs. Trying to stage an intervention, if she can get to her therapist (who an amazing woman) at her own free will. She is so tired and depressed. It’s heartbreaking.","OMG!

BlueMoon",Hello again.  I am  glad that you found my post helpful.  One thing to consider is that if your daughter is declared incompetent and unable to make decisions due to the illness you can look into becoming her medical power of attorney and then you can make medical decisions for her and have her placed in a program against her will.  My parent's had that for a while with me.  It also allowed them to speak with the doctors when otherwise they would not be allowed because of HIPPA.  This is a good law but also harmful as it blocks parents from being able to help their adult children from getting necessary help.  ,"Hello again.  I am  glad that you found my post helpful.

She has never spent time away from home or close relatives before, so naturally, I am very hesitant. I am looking at a treatment facility in Portland Oregon. Does anyone have any experience with it?
Thank you in advance.","Dear ginetta, we would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove the name of the treatment facility. Treatment center recommendations are not allowed on our forums. You can review our community guidelines here. You can call NEDA's Helpline at 1-800-931-2237 to speak with a volunteer about treatment options. Helpline Hours are Monday-Thursday 9am-9pm ET, Friday 9am-5pm ET. ","Hi.  I am sad to hear that your daughter is suffering with an eating disorder and you are having to deal with the pain of having her go to a residential facility.  I know it must be breaking your heart to see her suffer and that you can't ""fix"" her.  Eating disorders are complex and painful.  I hope you called NEDA for some suggestions.  I am sorry we are not able to give out that type of information but it really is best for you as some of us may have a good experience at a particular facility and another a terrible experience at the very same facility.  So the forum dissuades us from talking about specific places we've been.  I would suggest that you call some yourself and ask them some questions such as:  what type of therapy is used?  DBT?  CBT?  A combination?  What types of groups are run, are they mixed girls/boys women/men?  The age range and size of the groups?  The subjects of the groups.  Are the patient's allowed in their rooms during the day or evening?  How long is allowed for meals?  What is one doesn't complete their meal?  Do they teach intuitive eating?  Do they teach meal plans and are the patients allowed to choose their menu?  How often will they see the dietician?  Psychiatrist?  Therapist?  Will there be trips outside of the facility?  If the patient is of age, are they allowed out on their own for walks on grounds?   Typical length of stay?  Calls home/usage of hospitals computers for emailing?  Family therapy sessions even if done over the phone?  Are they allowed a certain amount of dislikes, foods the person does not like, usually three is the limit.  Most places do not allow vegetarian but some do, if it isn't being used as a means to control the food they eat.  This will be dealt with on an individual basis.  ","Hi.

We are so glad that you have found a space where you can share your story about your daughter. I just wanted to check in with you to see if you were able to speak with someone from any residential treatment facilities?

84,05/25/2019,HowCanILearntoCommunicateBetterwithmyDaughteraftersendinghertoTreatment?,"We finally pulled our 16 year old from school and put her into a day program. She is mad. I betrayed her. I promised I would not put her in to a place she did not belong. She needs to be there. She doesn't see that. Somekids are severe there. She's not. She eats, now. She needs to learn how to eat enough to gain and maintain and how to have a healthy relationship with food..not the one that she believes is healthy. When people say ""eating disorder"" it's upsetting to her. I try to explain that ED encompasses a lot , not just not-eating. There are psychological components, behavioral..etc...and what she shows her parents is her distain for what we have ""to"" her...she can't see what we have done ""for"" her. She believes that she can just eat more. Exercise less. She is with drawing from friends because she doesn't want to explain where she is and why she's not at school. We love her so much and want to support her, we hope that she will understand, but she can't now. I want to control my temper when she lashes out at me and speaks harsh, I can sometimes, but not always. I want to learn how to communicate with her while she is in this new stage--the extremely angry stage. Advice?","Hi staypositive, welcome to the NEDA forums!

We're glad you are posting, and encourage you to continue to do so!","Hello and welcome to the forum.  I am glad you found us here. I am not a parent, but an adult child and someone who started out with an eating disorder when I was around your daughters age.  I am free from all forms of eating disorders for an entire year and due to the fact that I had it for so long this is celebration time.  I say this to encourage you.  My parent's were both nurses and knew what was happening.  They gave me the threat, lose one more X and in you go.   Of course I didn't believe them, that I was really ""that sick"" and how stupid they were to be sending me off to a hospital.  Well, they knew what they were doing and this was in the early 80's when very little was known about how to treat eating disorders.  You said you broke your daughters trust.  You told her that if it wasn't necessary you wouldn't make her do x y and z.  But then you said she needs this.  So, trust yourself and not her anger.  It is a very confusing time at this age.  I was only in ninth grade when I was sixteen so I wound up missing a lot of school.  You are so right on when you say an eating disorder is so much more about food and numbers and weight.  It is about learning to live in the big wild world.  I am just starting to do this at age fifty-one because I was paralyzed by fear of living.  So I existed for most of my life.  You are doing the most loving thing you know how to do for your daughter.  She may not see it now but she will understand one day.  I know you are scared, probably a bit angry, and frustrated.  I suggest trying to not get into battles over food.  Let the professionals help her with that.  See if you can just let her know that you are there for her if she ever wants to talk.  She may be too angry right now, but keep up letting her know that if she ever needs to talk with you about anything you are there for her.  Get help for yourself.  It is tremendously difficult for parent's to go through this terrifying illness.  Do you have friends to support you?  Can you see your own therapist for a while?  About your anger, I think you need to understand what it is about.  Is it fear based, or not knowing how to help your daughter as you see her self destruct?  Do you have a faith based community where you can draw support from?  I know without my faith in Jesus and my Christian friends and parents I would not be alive today.
I hope this helps some.  I know I am not a parent, but my Mom and I have talked about what my experience did to her and how she cried herself to sleep a lot.

85,05/23/2019,Newtothis,"Hi, my 15 year old daughter has been struggling with bulemia for about 7 months now. She came to me about two months ago asking for help. Admitted that it was getting out of control and she was scared. After going to numerous psychologists, we finally found one that specializes in eating disorders and she has started therapy (once a week). We've only been twice so far so I haven't seen any changes this soon.  I think she uses behaviors at least 4 times a week if not more. She uses behaviors right in front of me,  she doesn't hide her disordered eating. It is so heartbreaking when I see her doing it,  especially when I know what she will do next after the eating is done. I get so frustrated, sometimes I just want to tell her to please stop eating, but I know I shouldn't do that. Another problem is that her best friend has an eating disorder(sometimes I wonder if she has a lot to do with what my daughter is going through now) the friend was self harming back during the summer and I found out my daughter had started to self harm around Thanksgiving. She did that for about two months.  That's when the eating disorder started. Her friend also convinced her that smokimg would help with her anxiety and food cravings. I found out that my daughter had bought one from a kid at school and has been using it for about a month now. Is it wrong of me to wish that this friend would move to the other side of the world?? Ugh I just don't know how to handle all of this. Any advice is appreciated.","Dear molly123, we would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove descriptions of specific eating disorder behaviors, which are not allowed on the forums.

86,04/23/2019,Anyoneelseinaholdingpatternorplateau,"My daughter is 17 and struggled with an ED for almost 2 years now.  She was never hospitalized but lost significant weight over a 3 month span and ended up passing out at her lowest weight.  She has been seeing a therapist who has been instrumental in her recovery.  That being said - it seems she is in a holding pattern - physically out of danger and for that I am so thankful and grateful, but emotionally stuck.  Not sure that really makes sense??  She just had a physical and was back up in the 30% for girls her age so that is amazing progress but it's more of what goes through her mind that concerns me.  I realize recovery is not linear and that you can't flip a switch but I guess I was naive in hoping there would be a time when it would be behind us or that I could selfishly put it down.  I try very hard NOT to powerstruggle about food choices but then I find myself thinking ""Really???  You are going to try to have this for snack - like are you kidding me???""  But then I realize well her friends all ate the same thing so that is pretty normal that she would ask for them.
 And I know it's not about a rice cake - it's about control, shame, independence. progress, setbacks and so much more.
In talking with her therapist I know that any judgement or frustration is so counter productive yet sometimes I fall into a mode where I want her to realize how hard I am working - BUT then I think wow if this is hard for me and she doesn't want to hurt me it must be so hard for her.  I am just wondering how other parents continue to support their teens - or how they find ways to separate what is a ""normal"" teen attitude and what is food restriction or active resistance?  I try to support her but I know she perceives my frustration which makes me feel guilty b/c I know that is detrimental to her progress.  Should I take a step back and be patient and thankful or keep nudging her forward.????

Not sure I have any helpful advice...just the fact that your not alone. I read your post and it was almost looking in a mirror.  My 12 year old was in intensive care October 2018, after a 2 month spiral.  She has been back home and out of outpatient since February.  Everything now is similar to your situation, she is out of danger but holding steady.  A small drop or small gain.  As this all began when puberty and normal teenage attitude began, I also sometimes am not sure which is normal teenage rebellion, and what is the ED.  I call my fiends with similar aged children but no ED, and some of the behavior is the same, back talk, and being mean to younger siblings, so there is definitely some co-mingling.  I do find times that she is talkative (definitely not during meals) where we can have a heart to heart, and it is at that moment where I try and get all the answers I am searching for.  So when you see that she is talkative and looking for some heart to heart, stop everything and find a place where the two of you can get the answers together.  Also I have put the ED books aside for the moment and am reading on Anxiety in adolescent girls.  It is an epidemic and from just speaking to parents with and without ED issues in their children, its incredible and sad to just see the numbers of people who are dealing with this issue.

Last year she spent 10 days in the hospital, and we hoped that would be the wakeup call that really changed her life.

Our daughters are a little different in age so what I may think about a 12 year old may be different for a 19 year old.  What I have read also is that when our children are malnourished they can not think logically and need our help to think for them.  My 12 year old at times looks at me with confused eyes and I know she can not do this on her own.   When we have a heart to heart we talk more about her anxiety as speaking about the orthorexia/anorexia shuts her right down.  I just feel if I wait for her to come to the realization that what she is doing is not healthy, it may be too late.  As I have a 12 year old I also need her to get weight restored and let puberty continue its  normal process again as soon as possible.

87,05/01/2019,Adviceplease,My daughter has recently been diagnosed with eating disorder. I've researched about it and I've read in an article that massage therapy had another impact on some patients such as decreasing many patients' dissatisfaction with their bodies and improved their mental self portrait. So I decided to go to a spa and have my daughter avail their services. We just started last week but I'm thinking if I'm doing the right medication/treatment for her...what should I do?,"Dear Jongi, welcome to the forums! We would like to let you know that we slightly edited your post to remove the outside link, which is not allowed on the NEDA forums. You can review our community guidelines here: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/forums/community-guidelines. Please continue posting! ","Is seek out professional help for your daughter.  Im sorry your daughter is suffering. I don't understand how massages are supposed to help recover.  In order to overcome this,  lots of therapy and treatment for the eating disorder is needed to uncover the reason behind the eating disorder.   A treatment team made up of a medical doctor,  therapist psychiatrist and dietitian is what will help the most in the long run.  Don't try to  do this without the professionals.   It cannot be done.","I am sorry to hear this news. I agree with the above.  When my 12 year old daughter fell ill, the downward spiral was very fast. within 2 months she was in the ICU will low heart rate. If it was slower I may have also sought out other treatments myself.  After reading many books and articles on the topic, I learned that this was a truly complex illness.  Read as much as you can and find help as soon as you cans the ED attaches itself very quickly and tightly","I actually did a research assignment on EDs and massage for a class some years ago.  It's certainly not going to take the place of regular therapy, but as an adjunctive addition it seems to have a positive effect.  I'm not sure what the mechanism of action is, but people with EDs can lose touch with the physical reality of their bodies, so I suspect that it may provide some help with that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,04/25/2019,"Daughterinrecovery,nowstrugglingw/weightgain","Been quite a while since I've posted on here. My now 18 year old daughter struggled with anorexia, has been doing very well in recovery for over 2 years. She is currently out of the country on an extended mission trip. She has had lots of anxiety while away on this trip. Recently her anxiety has been focused on how much weight she has gained (which is real, and not distorted by her). It has been very difficult for my wife and myself trying to work through her issues with her from half way around the world. We are struggling with how to talk to her about her weight gain, without possibly enabling her falling back into her ED. She has said some worrisome thing along the lines of being angry with us for making gain weight while she was sick, because then she was at least in control, and now she feels like she has no self-control and no will-power when it comes to food. She says she is over-eating, particularly late at night, and making unhealthy choices (junk food, sweets etc)when she does it. Trying to talk to her about without inadvertently enabling her disorder is tricky. Any suggestions on how to deal with these issues?",(I read your posts on the other forum),"(I read your posts on the other forum)As IWTL said, it's easy for people to become concerned about weight gain.

She did an 11 day hospital stay and we've been managing her illness with the support of an FBT therapist.  Actually multiple:  we originally spent the first 8 months with one via an FBT research study, then we stayed on our own for a while, and now we have a new therapist and a dietician that we really like.We've been able to keep her weight stable and close to her targets, but her anorexic behaviors and willingness to see this as an illness that she wants to fight have not budged.  In some ways, things are worse now than when she first got out of the hospital.

I am not a parent. I am one who has been in residential.  I am really sorry for all that you have been going through.  When I was going through treatment, FBT didn't exist.  I don't know how well I would have coped with it with my mindset.  I hear how incredibly tired you are and how hard you have tried.  I give you a lot of credit and I thank you for all you have done for your daughter.  It has to be so difficult.  ","Hello.  I am not a parent. I am one who has been in residential.

I hear how incredibly tired you are and how hard you have tried.  I give you a lot of credit and I thank you for all you have done for your daughter.  It has to be so difficult.  For residential, I would see how long it lasts.  Some last a few weeks, some, I was in one for six months.  So they are all very different.  I would want to know if they work towards intuitive eating which teaches the individual to learn when they are hungry and full, but that takes time after weight restoration.  Also, I would ask what type of therapy they use, CBT, DBT, how many times a week they get individual therapy and for how long.  If they are a part of developing what they will be eating or are they given a plate of food not knowing each meal.  How often they will meet with the dietician.  Will they get to know their weight at any point in the process.  What happens if they don't complete a meal?  What are the consequences.  How long they have to complete a meal.  Are they allowed in their rooms during the day or evening?  What are the ages of the others, co-ed or not.  What types of groups will be held, what a typical day looks like.  Will there be trips outside of the facility during the stay.  Are they allowed dislikes, I was allowed three foods I didn't like, not fear foods, real dislikes.  How much do they involve you guys as parent's.  How much will they discuss with you without her permission being that she is a minor.  These are just a few questions I can think of.  I also wouldn't pick a facility for distance sake but for how good it is.  Often some place aren't as good as others and if you can find a place that you like, even though it may be difficult, if it is a good one but further away than you would like I would consider going to the one that best suits your daughter.   It has to be extremely difficult to have one so young dealing with such a serious illness.  If you believe in God, involve Him as much as you can in your decision making process.  For me, my healing finally came when I was able to give all my fears and control over to Jesus and finally be free from this.  My parent's love and care and forcing me into programs when I didn't want to go, and then the adult me finally  accepting responsibility and saying no to the eating disorder and yes to what Jesus wanted for me brought about my ultimate healing.    Please let us know how things go and know you are not alone.  I am sorry I spoke not as a parent, but I hope I was able to offer some insight.","Hello.  I am not a parent.

My 12 year old daughter went through similar situation September 2018 She was admitted to a hospital for 2 weeks.  She was then transferred to an inpatient facility. Its a little different I imagine then residential but more or less the same.  As this was all new to me, I don't really remember being asked, but rather told that this was next logical step.  I absolutely advise AGAINST any inpatient program.  After fighting for 2 weeks in the hospital to not have a feed tube inserted, the inpatient facility inserted 1 after 1 night.  My daughter spent 2 weeks there and she was miserable throughout.  Myself and my ex-wife were there every day visiting and saw how the employees treated the patients horriblly.  They were treated like prisoners, and with absolutely no respect.  We were treated worse simply for visiting, as they had now work instead of hiding in their offices and reading.  My daughter is back home after 3 months at an outpatient facility and is going through research program as well.  Every day is a challenge but she is maintaining her weight.  She also does not believe that she has a problem which makes it even more difficult. Good luck to you and your daughter","Hello, We would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove your email address.

Users are discouraged from sharing specific numbers.    https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/forums/community-guidelines    Thank you and please continue posting.,"Hello. My daughter is 12 also, and is very much like your daughter.  My best advice would be to read as much as you can.  I have read Help your teenager beat an eating disorder, and Eating with your anorexic.   Both have helped me tremendously.  The moods and depression I just say to myself that this is not my daughter who for 12 years was a model daughter, and still is, but the yelling and moodiness is the eating disorder talking and not her.  She truly ants and needs help, but does not understand her illness.  I have not tried medications and hope to never.  Basically whatever works to get the medicine (food) in is fine. Good luck","Hello and welcome to the forum.  I am so very sorry for your pain and for the suffering of your daughter.  I am sorry that the doctors don't listen to Mom's who know their children and instead treat people like things.  It is such a shame that while you were trying so hard to get your daughter who you knew needed help were told, ""she is fine"".  You knew better and now are dealing with her health issues that are even more serious. I am not a mother, but I know one. Mine.  She dealt with me in the years I dealt with a serious eating disorder with my father.  They were both active nurses at the time.  I am told how I was very angry and extremely difficult. When I was so sick back initially in the mid 80's, there was little known about treatment in hospitals or out.  Now more is known, but not enough.

There are usually always reasons an eating disorder develops.  Understanding those and finding out why are key.  Family therapy at her age is also very helpful.  I believe in letting her know what is and is not acceptable, such as screaming and yelling.  But a therapist would be helpful in helping you know how to handle these things.  I am not a therapist.  I only know from experience that fear played a big role in why I stayed ill for so long.  I also didn't know that my first ""diet"" would take me down the road it did.

91,03/23/2019,Orthorexia/anorexia,"Hello everyone and thanks for being on this site. First time I ever joined a forum. Let’s get right to the point. My 12 year old daughter was diagnosed with orthopedic/anorexia nervous while in the ICU. She did 2 weeks in hospital, 2 weeks inpatient, 3 months outpatient. She is finally back at home. I am a father and divorced 50/50% custody.   Meals are difficult as you can imagine and with orthorwxia even more as I don’t necessarily disagree with eating healthy and my daughter has no issue with her weight, actually is happy when she maintains or even gains, to get out of the programs.  Still she is anorexic as she needed hospitalization.  My ex and I are amicable and on the same page usually. My issue is this and all help is appreciated. My ex has issues with all programs my daughter has entered. She has shown disdain for all medical professionals in front of our daughter and feels she is not getting the correct treatment.  This in turns emboldens my daughter to feel she is right in thinking these programs are useless and Shenzhen knows what she is doing.  I have had my issues with her treatment teams throughout but the difference is, I have absorbed much information about the disease and the treatment and understand their plan. My ex wife and daughter feels she needs emotional therapy and that the concentration thus far has only been on her relationship with food.  I’ve explained the whole “anxiety wont kill her/ but an ED will”
Now we were accepted into a research program but now the ex is finds no issues with this as well and in front of my daughter again so she will feel like she can quit with her mother’s blessing.  Her mom now says that the only good treatment are the ones that I simply can’t afford. I do not believe that money is the answer and the more you spend the better therapy you will receive.   How do I get an ex wife to read and understand why solving the disordered eating is the first and most important issue to confront instead of just saying it is not enough.  We are finally going to receive some FBT and learn how to help feed our daughter.  It seems they argue a lot when she is feeding her and she is giving up. My daughter entered the hospital in November 2018 after a very rapid amount of weight loss in less than a certain amount of time.

92,02/16/2019,Anyhelpappreciated,"My son is 13. He has been a picky eater since he started eating solid food pretty much. Over time, it has gotten much worse. He will say he is hungry, but nothing sounds good. No matter what I suggest, I usually hear, ""That doesn't sound good."" He will eat only about a dozen things. And food items keep dropping off the list. He used to like a certain food, but won't eat it anymore-no good reason-he says he doesn't like it. He is NOT intentionally anorexic. He WANTS to eat, but can't force himself to if something doesn't 'sound good' to him. Feeding him is my number one worry and stress. He ends up eating alot of fast food because that is what I can get him to eat at times and he doesn't like more than a couple of things I make. He is now starting to say he doesn't like fast food-so the list is dwindling even smaller. He is in a certain percentile in weight for his age/height. He also hates this. He is a very anxious child and exhibits some OCD tendencies.
I have never heard of this type of eating disorder issue before. His doctor doesn't seem to be much help. I have had him to counseling for anxiety and that didn't help at all. I feel this may be a brain chemistry issue and don't know where to turn. Has anyone else had an issue similar to this?","Hi.  I am sorry you are having such difficulties with your son.

93,07/29/2018,MyDDisillandIfeelhelplessandhopeless,"Hi
I have a 17 year old daughter that has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and anorexia. For the past couple of years i thought something was wrong but could not figure it out and my dd had not been forthcoming to her therapist.  Last month i found out my dd had been harming herself over a 6 month period, drinking, smoking, sneaking out of the house, lying, manipulating, dieting and exercising ( she is thin ) being promiscuous and she has a 4.0 GPA taking all honors and ap classes and plays to high school sports.
She has been in a PHP day program for about 4 weeks, last week stopped eating over the weekend because she had ex-boyfriend trouble and ended up in the hospital for dehydration.
I am so lost.  I don't know how to handle meal times on the weekends and evenings when she is not at program.  I have her meal plan, list of food and exchanges but she is picky, does not want to eat and I want to make food she will eat and likes.  It's a vicious circle.  She will eat when we go to a restaurant but that's not sustainable.  I don't understand.
She sits on her phone and the couch, barely talks and has told my wife that she has done a lot of ""bad things"" and has shame, but she is not willing to share this.  I believe it will help her get out of shame by getting it off her chest.  I honestly don't care what she's done or has happened.  i believe she can develop better morals, values and charater traits going forward.
She asked the Dr. to discharge her tomorrow.  She has been there for 4 weeks and barely seems like anything is different about her.  It seems like she thinks her way to wellness almost delusional but her behaviour and actions don't really seem like that.
I really don't know where to begin or what to do. Seems like i just want to help her eat and stay alive.  Seems like such a low bar.  Please help me with suggestions, insight and direction.  I am struggling.  I need some reality from a person in this forum that has similar experience or situation.
Thank you so much.","Hello and welcome to the forum.  First, I am so sorry for your pain.  For your daughters pain.  This is no simple matter.  It is as complicated as you wrote.  From someone who has suffered with eating disorders, starting with anorexia, now recovered, I also was seriously self harming.  It is so painful for parent's to watch their daughter's suffer.  One thing you need to understand is that you can be there for DD. But you can not change her.  You can support her, let her know you love her, but she has to want to change.  Dishonesty and lying are common with this disorder.  It is a way of protecting it from being ""taken away"" from the sufferer.  Shame is another biggie.  From what you have said, it sounds like she is suffering from shame and it is most difficult talking about these things.  Unfortunately, no one can make her talk about what is truly bothering her.  Not until she is ready.  What would be a good thing for you and your wife to do is get help for yourselves.  Get some therapy perhaps.  It is so important that this doesn't affect your relationship.  Having a sick child can do this.  Getting therapy to help you both work through any false guilt you may have at not being able to ""fix"" your daughter may be very helpful.  My parent's couldn't fix me.  I was in many hospitals.  They didn't fix me.  They saved my life by getting me stable.  Yes.  But it didn't make me better until I decided I wanted to get better and then it was a journey after that.  Giving up old ways of coping and working hard at giving up old behaviors and patterns.  It took time.  I am not saying therapy won't help your daughter. It can help a lot.  The hospitalizations and day programs can be immensely helpful.  But it may take more than one time.  When your daughter realizes she is tired of this lifestyle, and really is ready to be honest, then you love her.  You tell her you are there for her when she is ready.  It is very unfortunate that love alone can't make one eat.  There is such fear of gaining weight that that fear takes over all reasoning.  Therapy can help one understand why they are focusing on that fear and find out what lies underneath the fear.  The eating disorder and other behaviors are used to deal with hurts, pain, insecurities, being bullied, not feeling deserving of being happy and any assortment of things that come up in therapy that people try to cover up the pain by using all these behaviors.  I hope this makes sense.  Then when malnutrition sets in, one can not think clearly anymore.  The brain needs nutrition to think properly.  That would be when being put through a refeeding program comes in.  To nourish the brain and body so the brain can think clearly enough to be able to sort through traumas or other things that cause one to turn to eating disorders, drugs, promiscuity and other behaviors.  There is hope.  She is young.  Eating disorders are serious but recovery is possible.  The thing is is that your daughter needs to come to a point where she wants it.  So, sorry this is so long.  Love her, you may need to set up boundaries, which a therapist would come in handy to help you with that, and let her know you are there for her when she wants to talk.  I am sorry for your pain.  I can tell you love your daughter and are confused and feel helpless.  Being a dad, I am not, but have one, and not being able to fix your children is maddening.  I know as I have watched my  father do this not just with me but some of my other sisters as well.  But there is hope.  Don't give up.  I am glad you posted and please let us know how things are going.  For now,","Hello and welcome to the forum.  First, I am so sorry for your pain.  For your daughters pain.

I am hearing that she must really want to get healthy and recover or she won't.  She needs to speak her shame to heal herself and do this in safety, BUT she has to really want to do this and really want to be healthy.
I am scared, very scared.  Tomorrow in therapy I am going to ask her where she is with wanting to recover?  I will listen and love her.  I fear so much right now.  My wife goes out of town for 5 days.  Emotionally I am so tired.
Thank you for answering.  I cant write more at this moment but will keep working on this and yes, i care about her so much, like really care.","Hi.

With caring thoughts, iwanttolive","Hi !   I am starting to understand her ED a tiny bit.  I live in fear of messing her up.  I see her eat, go to therapy etc.. but something inside me says she's ok and she's not ok.   She has been very public about her ED and i think that helps her.  I try to spend more time growing and strengthening me as a person and trust that her journey is on the right track.  She has a good therapist, psych, and nutritionist all she sees regularly.  She's been in the ER twice for dehydration.
Sorry it's been so long.","Hi.  I am glad you wrote again.  It seems that your daughter is giving you conflicting information on how she is doing.  I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you.  It seems that you are taking care of yourself and that is good to hear.  Remember that this is her journey.  You can offer support and love, but as you have heard before, she needs to want to get better.  You can have boundaries if she is living with you, and this would be something to discuss with her therapist.  Not as punishment, but to help the both of you.  This is a serious illness as you know so it is good that she is seeing her treatment team and if you have any concerns, you can tell them, they just may not be able to discuss her treatment with you, but I think it is okay if you tell them if you have concerns.  I am sorry you are all still struggling with this.  NEDA have volunteers you can talk with also if you need to.  Take care for now and I am  sorry I couldn't offer more help.  ","Hi.

We understand the delay in our response but we wanted to provide you with some information in case you may need to know this now or in the future.

Another option is 911. ","Your daughter is going through a very difficult time and this must be hard for you as a parent to witness her go through with this.
  You mention her college and sporting achievements which indicate that your daughter is very talented.  However, it is not uncommon for anyone who is succeeding at whatever they do to feel an element of isolation from their peer groups.  Success can, at times be rather lonely.  There could also be a lot of stress involved.
  Your daughter has been diagnosed as having depression, anxiety and anorexia.  All these conditions could result in her not being too forthcoming with her therapist.  She would be more than clever enough to hide the self-harming, drinking, smoking and so on from her therapist.
   The drinking and smoking could be her way of trying to be part of the crowd she is either hanging out with, or trying hard to be part of.
  She knows that you are not going to be very approving of her leaving the house to partake in whatever adventures she is undertaking when out your sight.  Hence, she ends up sneaking out of the house in the belief that you will be none the wiser.
  Her lying, manipulating and self-harming must be a worry for you.  The self-harming will need addressing in therapy and will take time to explore because of the deep emotions that cause the self-harm.
   The dieting and exercising is good in moderation and if done sensibly under professional guidance such as the gym.  However, many young people - and all age groups - find themselves taking it to more extreme levels
  Our society today is so much based upon the influence of visual social media.  At one time, teenagers were influenced by the TV and magazines for their 'role models'.  Now, with the internet, it is 'full-on' 24/7.
    Your daughter could be experiencing a high level of stress due to her working hard at college.  Many of us don't express the fact that we are suffering from stress in our lives.
    You mention problems with her ex-boyfriend. Is she having serious difficulty moving on or handling the ending of this relationship with him?
    Your daughter also does seem to be trying hard to find a way of wanting help.  Her boyfriend trouble has lead her to stop eating and end up being hospitalised.  There does seem to be an issue where she is using food - or denial of food - as a means of expressing her inner feelings.
  Your daughter wants to eat in public such as restaurants yet won't eat the food you put on the table in front of her.  OK...She is willing to eat when she does want to.
  There is the possibility however, that your daughter does not want to show her troubles when out in public places.
     There is certainly the possibility that your daughter is not being forthcoming with what is happening in her life.  She does seem to be trying to tell you what is wrong by saying that she has done 'bad things'.  The problem here is that she is not ready to openly share this with you.
        A counsellor/therapist will be able to help her with discussing the the issues about the  shame and bad things.  She will then learn how to deal with these issues over time.  Much of what she is trying to visually express could be discussed with a therapist who fully understands what your daughter is trying hard to say.
    The only person who can really help your daughter is herself at the end of the day.  She is going through a very difficult time and all you can do is continue with what you are doing to help her through it all.  That is be there for her when times are hardest and support her as best as you can.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem is, she has severe diarrhea ever since she started eating- she goes to the bathroom probably around X times a day, if not more. I’ve considered laxative abuse but i don’t think that’s the case. What should I do? Is this normal? Is it advisable to prevent her from earing what she wants, as not to upset her stomach? How do I belp stop it? How do I know when she is in danger? I feel like if we go to a doctor they will put her on a very strict diet like if she hd the stomach flu, and I think that would pull her back into restricting.

My hubby totally did not get it, and saw eating disorder as a result of my spoiling our daughter. I yelled and screamed at him, “ stop trying to be one if you cannot make it a good doctor; just be a helper on the side if you do not know how to be a good parent, stopping making the problem worse. Enough on my body already!” Later on I showed him a YouTube video on eating disorder story, he started getting it! ","It will take a lot of baby steps, I truly get it.

I am constantly tired and still on medications for morning sickness and heartburn. Plan to work until end of Jan to get top-up allowance during maternity leave. We have to consider the financial reality. I wish I could be off work now to focus on helping my daughter with her eating disorder issue. At the same time, I am sometimes unhappy with her, thinking that she is so self-Centered on her body issue and forgets that her not-so-young mother has to go through pregnancy discomfort all the time! Hope my baby will not pop out too early because of the stress! All in God’s hands...","Hello getwell2019, We are glad you are here on the NEDA forums seeking support in taking care of your daughter.

Thank you for sharing your story.  I am so sorry your young daughter is struggling with an eating disorder but glad to hear she wants help and she came to you.  That is really going to help in the difficult days ahead.  I am sure you just want to put your feet up and rest with all that is going on.  Soon the new baby will be here and you will be getting help for yourself and your daughter.  It is such a good thing she is young and wants help.  That should be of great help.  Not easy.  Just the thought processes and behaviors aren't ingrained for years and the process although difficult won't be as difficult to turn around.  I don't want to make it sound like she isn't sick and doesn't need help.   Not at all.  And I am glad you are there for her.  I am in recovery after thirty plus years of suffering.  The family based treatment wasn't around in the 80's and I don't know if I would have been able to go it.  I have been in recovery from the anorexia for around three years I think, and the overeating and binging for six months as well as self harm for six months.  I also suffered from major depressive disorder and anxiety.  A lot of individuals do who also suffer with an eating disorder. The depression is a lot better as is the anxiety but there are still days it can be difficult.  But the eating is great.","Hello and welcome to the forum.  Thank you for sharing your story.

It doesn't own us.  It may want to but it doesn't.  We may suffer from an eating disorder but to say my or my daughter's, etc. to me gives it an identity and power.  My identity is in who Christ says I am.  I am His child.  I am set free.  I belong to Him.  The only one who has that kind of power in my life is Jesus.  So I have learned over the years to treat the eating disorder as an entity outside of myself.  I truly  believe this helped in my recovery.  So just something to think about. I am glad you posted.

98,11/30/2018,MydaughterdisagreesaboutBMI,"Hello everyone,
My 13 year old daughter was recently diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.  She grew over 4 inches fairly recently (she is now 5' 4 1/2"") and simultaneously slimmed down, so my wife and I though she had slimmed down due to rapid growth, so we didn't realize there was a problem with anorexia for several months.  She later admitted she was going days at a time without eating or restricting to only X calories per day at times.  She has been unable to complete her school work due to lack of focus, which has never happened before, so we had her placed on medical school leave.  When we took her to the doctor, he checked her urine and she was dehydrated. I guess we caught this relatively early - her BMI was borderline of healthy weight when at the doctor. We took our daughter to a doctor who specializes in eating disorders, and she said our daughter needs to gain more weight to repair her brain and organs.  My daughter disagrees, saying that a BMI of X is a ""healthy"" weight, so as long as she is at least at X, she is fine.  We have a meeting with a nutritionist next week to discuss BMI in detail, but I was wondering if there is anything we should be telling our daughter in the mean time.  She insists she only has to eat X calories per day with moderate exercise (based on online calorie calculators) to maintain her X BMI.  What is normally recommended for calories at this point, and what are parents supposed to tell recovering children who argue that X BMI is healthy?

How could ED's be what they are and I just had no clue?  I actually feel ashamed to some degree.When I started this journey as a parent I was terrified, and to be quite frank I still am.  I started a journal before she was admitted and I have found it to be a good way for me to vent, or to cope with what is happening.  Writing things out seems to help me.  I was thinking about starting a blog, my intent is to bring awareness to the disease and also share my story as a dad.  I couldn't find the specific answers I was looking for in the beginning of this journey.  I couldn't find any on the facility or anything in general about what the first day would be, or what the 21st day would be.

I think so much of the place I wish I could sing their praises here but I understand that is not allowed.  Everything you spoke of in your above post has absolutely been discussed and we are briefed regularly.  The facility runs like a well oiled machine and I am so happy places like this exist.  Things now are much better than what they were a month or so ago, it was just so scary in the beginning.  Everything you spoke about is covered, my post was a little misleading I see after I went back and read it, sorry.You are correct, right now it is about my daughter.  I have just returned to work and that's where I am tonight.  When I get off in the morning we will head back down to see my daughter, we have Thur-Sun this week because of the holiday.  She is doing well in the program and I am so thankful for that.  I hope you to have a wonderful Thanksgiving.  Talk to you soon.  Oh yeah, thanks for giving me a response on my post, I really appreciate it.","I am so glad you like the place your daughter is in.  No worries over the misunderstanding.  I had some really BAD experiences.  So I am so happy to hear your daughter is doing better and you like the facility.  Hopefully this will be the only time she needs inpatient, but just know she may need a higher level of care in the future.  Coming out of inpatient is difficult as the 24/7 isn't there.   Will she go into an outpatient program or is that too far in the future?  For me, it took a very long time to surrender the eating disorder to God.  I don't know why.  I just was too afraid to live.  My username, iwanttolive, is because for most of my life I did not want to.  I wanted to die so badly.  I almost did on numerous occasions but God had and has other plans and I am so thankful for my recovery and life.  Tonight at church I thanked God publicly for helping me overcome the eating disorder and self harm.  I spent so much of my life sick that now at 51 I am learning how to live as an adult.  My life was gone for so long being so sick.  I am now doing well and am preparing to help others even outside of this forum.  I am just waiting on God to direct me and I have some ideas.

I can only imagine how scared and unprepared you were finding out about your daughter's condition.  My parent's are nurses so they knew more than most what was happening but they couldn't stop me from doing what I was doing until they threw my butt into a hospital.  They got me onto Medicare at age 16 and I am still on it.  They knew the potential for long term help.  Your daughter seems motivated so I pray she will not have to go through what I did.  They know how to treat the illness better than they did when I was first sick.  I think that was a big part of why it took me so long to get well, poor help in the beginning in the early 80's.  Anyways, it is getting very late, again, for me so I have to go.  Any help I can provide I would like to be available.  So I don't want to overwhelm you but just post and I will see if I can help.

What is the best want to support her until treatment begins?,"Hi.  I am sorry to hear about your daughter but it is good that she came to you and let you know.  My best suggestion is to ask her what she needs and how best you can help her.   Let her know you are there to talk with her if she needs to.  Let her know you are there for her and are thankful that she is trusting you.  Open dialogue is really good.   I wouldn't try to force her to eat or monitor her food as she will be getting help soon.  It may cause her to pull away.  It is a good sign that she is trusting you right now.  Research the hospitals you are looking into.  Ask questions about how long meal times are, if they practice intuitive eating, if the patient knows what they will be eating and be filling out their own meal plan or is their food placed before them without them knowing what is being served.  Are they allowed in their rooms during the day.  Some of these types of questions so your daughter knows what to expect.  What model of therapy will be used.  I wish you the best and am glad your daughter reached out to you.  That is so good.  Best to all of you.","Hi.

101,08/20/2018,Advicefortalkingtomyfamily?,"Hi! I hope you don't mind me coming to this forum as I'm not actually a parent, I'm the child (24 yr old child). I need to talk to my family, but need some advice so I was hoping y'all could help give me some perspective. My ED started about 7 years ago, but I've been in recovery for almost two years with a few rough patches here and there. It started towards the end of high school and I did everything I could to hide it from my parents-I think they suspected something, but we just don't communicate in our family so nothing was said to me. I left for college and that's where my friends took over. When I had breakdowns or had to go to the hospital or anything they were there for me. I hate that I lied to my parents about so much - making up reasons why I was in the hospital and stuff, but I didn't want them to know because I was ashamed. Now that I truly feel I'm doing better I have to get this burden off my chest and tell them, but I'm still scared. Do you, as parents, have any advice for me? I'm going to try to talk to my older sister first because she's actually a therapist so maybe she can give me some advice on how to handle them as well, especially knowing their personalities. She was away at school during these years though so I imagine she'll be a bit surprised. One other thing is she and I live a few hours away so I don't know how to meet with her because I really want to do it somewhere private, not at a restaurant or anything. Any suggestions there? I just really want this secret out so I can feel free and also so maybe they'll understand me better and why I hate diet talk and stuff ya know? Thanks for any advice!!","I am by far not a pro, but I am a parent of a 15 year old with an eating disorder.  I am fairly new to this, my daughter begins Day 16 of her inpatient treatment tomorrow.

You are right in saying it was the illness that had your daughter be secretive about her eating disorder.  Fear of it being taken away.  Fear of having to gain weight.  Fear in general perhaps of disappointing you.  I am glad she is in treatment now.   I know from experience that I have always been a very honest person.  But I have to say, I lied when I was in the eating disorder.  I hated it but needed to protect my eating habits and the control it gave me.  The power I felt from losing weight.  And then when I was suffering from bulimia, I certainly didn't want them to know that as it was so shameful to me.  But when things stay in the dark, the grow bigger.  But light brings freedom and healing.  I wish this for you and your family.  There is no blame here.  You obviously love your daughter and that love will help you through the days to come.

102,10/30/2018,TalkingToYourChild,"Hi, my name is Zoe and I’m 18 years old. I’m not a parent of a sufferer but I would like to share a story about how my parent affected my eating behaviors because I think it could greatly help someone else some day. When I was 12, I started binging, purging, restricting, exercising excessively, and counting calories. My parents have been divorced since I was young and I moved to a new state with my mom and her new husband, thousands of miles away from my family and friends. I was bullied in school and only had one good friend, a neighbor of mine who was homeschooled. My friend’s family practically raised me because my mom paid no attention to me whatsoever. We barely talked. She was so focused on her new husband. I wanted her to help me. I kept wondering, why can’t she see what I am doing to myself? Why can’t she see I am hurting?
I found out years later that my mom new the whole time. I confessed to her that I used to binge and purge and she said, “Oh I know.” I can’t stress how much this hurt me. She knew the whole time and did nothing to help me. She said she saw how I went to the bathroom after every meal and how I barely ate. I am still so pained by this. She said “I never said anything because I didn’t know how to help you. We couldn’t afford therapy.”
Parents, if you notice your child is suffering, or if you even suspect they may be engaging in disordered eating behaviors, TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT!!!! It may be a difficult conversation to have, especially if you feel distanced from your child, but it can save their life. If my mom, who I have never been very close to, had even asked me a question about my eating behaviors, I believe it would have helped me greatly. I could have gotten help and treated these behaviors early on so I would not still be struggling with them 6 years later. Your child, no matter how difficult they may be, deep down they do want you to notice. They want to get help. Even if they aren’t ready to receive treatment, knowing someone notices and cares can do wonders. Talk to your child. Don’t interrogate them or berate them. Be gentle. But let them know you are there and you care about them. I promise they notice. I promise they care, even if they say or act like they don’t. It does make a difference. Don’t let denial or fear control you as it controls your child with ED.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

104,08/01/2018,My11yroldDDconstantlybodycheckingandselfloathing,"Our DD was diagnosed with Anorexia in April having very quickly lost a lot of weight and becoming obsessed with exercise.
We were referred to local child mental health support service and thankfully she has restored her weight but what she is now suffering mentally by her still being completely tormented by the anorexic voice in her head that is telling her she is fat and she is obsessed with body checking in any mirror or reflective surface (shop windows, cars etc)
We have talked about this in therapy and hid the mirrors in our house.
We are now on our summer holiday and I think we have made a stupid mistake as we have chosen a poolside and beach holiday which means she is having to wear a swim suit and sienna the first few hours of the day crippling herself and burying herself because she knows she wants to jump in the pool with her sibling but the anorexia and anxiety won’t let her.
I am trying my best to say encouraging and supportive things and sit patiently with her.  Sometimes just holding her until she finds she can do it.
I am wanting to hear from any other parents who can offer words or phrases that have helped their children. It is so sad to see our girl trapped and locked in her head and we are desperate to help her.","Hi Sealfearn, welcome to the NEDA forums.

She's constantly looking at herself and pinching herself and it breaks my heart. I hope she is doing a little better since you have posted this question. Just wanted you to know you are not alone.,"Hi.  I was just wondering how your girls are doing since last posted.  I am sorry your daughters are going through this.  It is good that you recognize the seriousness of the situation and are getting your daughters help.   My parents got me help when I was sixteen. The sooner they get help and stop the cycle and patterns the better their chance of not having this take years to overcome. The earlier the patterns of behavior are stopped, the easier it is to break them.  I think having them get counseling is a good idea, to figure out why they have turned to focus on their bodies and focus on food and weight.  This is very helpful and can help them from developing full blown eating disorders.  I wish the best for you and thank you for taking such good care of your daughters.","Hi.

105,09/25/2018,Idon'tgetit,"I have read so much on the internet looking for helpful advice. I have a teen daughter who has been restricting her food.  She is underweight. This all is new over the summer. And really just in the last two months.  No real traumas.  I feel like it started when she got mad that I didn't let her switch schools. She realized she was letting her food attitude get out of hand but chose to continue because it wasn't bad enough yet. Whatever that means. Then she asked for help.   I have set up a meeting with a nutritionist and have been there twice. And once to a therapist.  And they very quietly encourage her to eat more. Why is no one calling her out on it? Giving her scary facts? Why would you tell her your not at anorexic level yett? Why is no one giving me info on how to implement a meal plan? Why is everyone waiting until she is in a danger zone?  I am frustrated and disgusted.  This is selfish. A pride issue.  And I am irritated by the coddling and lack of action.  I can calmly sit and wait on her to eat a set diet...but  I need someone outside of the family to give me the rules. What is reasonable- What to serve. Then I would be able to simply say doctors orders- just do it.  If I implement without that it will become an emotional battle of wills.  I look at her and am scared for her, but I really just see stubborn pride and defiance.  Is there a meal plan online somewhere?  Some guidance for action to take to restore some of herb weight?  I don't mind continuing therapy. But I am frustrated at how slow the process is to get going while the weight drops so quickly.","Hi.  I am so sorry you are  having to deal with this.  It is frustrating, but I don't think it is simple.  And not necessarily a pride thing or being stubborn just to cause you grief.  Being that I don't know all the details, what I do know is that when I was anorexic, I was terrified of food and of gaining any amount of weight.  Being in control was the number one thing in my mind. Controlling what I ate and how much and watching the numbers go down on the scale was intoxicating.  I am glad you are in therapy.  Could you ask the dietician to recommend a meal plan so she doesn't slip further down and start having health complications.  Can her therapist tell her what will happen if she continues to lose weight?  I know you are scared, maybe angry, worried.  These are all normal reactions to watching your daughter suffer and you feeling like you are not able to help her.  It is positive that she is talking with a therapist.  That is such a good sign.  It would be good if you got help for yourself as well.  I don't know why no one has told her of what could happen.  She needs to hear it.  But scare tactics don't work all that well.  But knowing that this illness is addictive and very serious may help her understand some and cause her to want to accept the help being offered.  I wish you the best and hope you let us know how things go.  Take care,","Hi.  I am so sorry you are  having to deal with this.  It is frustrating, but I don't think it is simple.

She wants to protect her illness and doesn't want it to be taken away because if gives her a false sense of comfort.  I know how scared my parents were and they are both nurses.  To have to sit and watch one's child suffer is incredibly painful.  I do hope you take a look at what NEDA has to offer and talk with them.  They are very helpful and have helped me a lot over the years.  I am now doing very well but it took a long time.  It makes it doubly difficult because your daughter is refusing help.  My parent's told me if I lost more weight they would put me in the hospital.  I didn't believe them and didn't believe I was that sick.  But they did follow through  with their threat.  I lost more weight and they had me hospitalized against my will to save my life.  This happened until I was able to realize I wanted to get better and now I am doing well and am in therapy still working through what caused the eating disorder and self harming behaviors.  It is so painful and I feel so much for you.  I am glad you reached out for support.  If you think her situation is life threatening, I would not hesitate to get her into a program.  She may hate you and curse at you but more than likely it will be the eating disorder voice speaking and not your real daughter.  As I said, she is probably very scared.  Lonely.  Doesn't understand what to do and how to reach out for help.  I don't know but depression may be playing a role here too.  I didn't realize how mean I was to my parent's until they told me recently. I am now fifty.  Not everyone suffers for as long as I have.  I was resistant to change mostly our of fear.  The sooner she gets help the better the chances of her recovering are.  I will pray for you and your daughter.  And your family.  I know how painful this is and wish I could give you a hug.  So I send a virtual hug through my words.  Keep in touch and post for support.

This will be my 16 year old son's third night in the hospital for an ED and he is getting an ng tube. He's very angry and upset about this and in complete denial that he has an ED. How do you support a child who's getting treatment against his will? I was told it's probably best if I'm not there to see the tube get put in (against his will) and when I go to the hospital he argues with me, pleading to get him out, and talks in circles. We're new to this. He's had an ED about 3 months. ","Hi,

We're new to this. He's had an ED about 3 months. thank you","Hello.  I am so sorry that your son is so ill.  And in denial.  Most of us are initially.  When I was 16 my nurse parents threatened me with the hospital if I lost more weight.  I didn't believe them and in I went.  This happened time and time again, even as an adult.  The fact that your son is angry is normal.  He is being force fed, he is terrified.  The people usually lashed out at the most are parents and loved ones.  The ""safety"" your son has felt from the anorexia is being taken from him against his will.  He will be angry.  And scared.  Remember that he is scared.  Having an ng tube is very frightening.  He will need your support and if he yells and fights you, deep down he is just a little kid and he needs you.  I know how difficult this is as now that I am older and in recovery after decades of fighting this ugly illness, my parent's and I have discussed how I treated them, and I was shocked.  I was also shocked at how ill they said I was and the programs I was in.  I find it difficult to believe even today, that I was that close to death.  So I encourage you that your son is really scared.  He is away from his surroundings, dealing with being forced to eat, gaining weight which is terrifying.  He most likely is unaware of all the hurt he is causing you.  You would do well to get some help for yourself as you go through this.  It may take a long time for him to recover.  You got it early and that is good.  I cried every day for a year when I was in the hospital and begged my parents every time I talked to them, daily, to get me out of that place.  They stuck to their belief that I had to be there.  It was agonizing for all involved.  I see what I did to my parent's but it was not on purpose.  It was fear, terror, anger, and torment of what I was going through.  Your son can get better.  Eating disorders are serious but recovery is possible as many can attest to that.  Hang on to Hope.  If you believe in God, cling to Him as you will need to during this time.  Try not to take his anger personally.  He doesn't know how to process all that is happening and you are an easy target.  You do need to take care of yourself, but know deep down, he doesn't hate you.  You are doing the right thing in getting him help.  I can tell you love him.  The pain on both sides is real.  Just be there for him.  Let him know you love him.  I would also let him know you are not his punching bag and he needs to be respectful when he talks to you, but allow him to cry and if he has to beg you to take him home, keep repeating that when he is well enough you will gladly take him home.  You will not abandon him.  Let him know you are there for him.  It is so difficult.  I am glad you posted and I will pray for your situation.  How was today?  Keep posting for support.  I am really glad you reached out here.  I hope to see you again.  Hang in there, as I know it is not easy.  Don't lose hope.  Hang onto it with everything in you.  My best wishes for you.","Hello.

Usually it is when the sufferer, your daughter, really realizes she needs help and wants it that recovery can begin.  Until she wants it for herself, all you can do is be there for her.  Listen and let her know you care.  Boundaries are at times necessary to preserve the relationship and keep you sane.  It may seem harsh but you must take care of yourself in order to be able to help your daughter.

115,02/02/2018,19yearolddaughterrefusestreatmentbutseemsOK.Whattodo?,"I'm sure I'm not the first one to deal with such a situation and hope one of you can help.
My 19 year old daughter is in a pre-college program and the teachers there discovered that she discussed ED behaviors with another student. After a short conversation it became clear that this has been going on for about 3 years, on and off. Most likely had to do with different stressors that we experienced in the family around that time. It also validated a concern we already had, though not recently.
The teachers demanded that she went to therapy in order to stay in the program, and she did for a few times. However, she basically told the therapist repeatedly ""I am fine and decided to stop"", so clearly the therapy is not going to be effective.
From what we can observe she is indeed eating in a more healthy way, seems much happier, has better social life, etc. Also, in a recent routine dental screening no special issues were fond.
She is reluctant to speak with us and says that ""everything is fine"".
Realizing that ED recovery is a process, we understand that she may be putting on a show to make it appear externally as if everything is fine, but she does seem happy.
Not sure whether to confront her, let it go, or perhaps would be good to know what signs to look for.
Any help is appreciated. Thank you!","Hi rockit, I'm sorry to hear about the situation with your daughter. I would say the best thing you can do is continue to be supportive and ask how your daughter is doing. If your daughter still does not seem happy, would she be interested in speaking to a therapist about her feelings in general rather than the focus being on an ED? I'm not a medical expert, but have found that finding the root cause of depression/stress may help with her happiness and confidence overall. Please continue to post and be well.","Rockit, NEDA has a number of excellent resources for parents to help us better understand and respond to our children who show signs of eating disorders.

Thanks again!!,"Moslin,","Moslin,I know this may be a drawn out process, but I'd be interested in hearing how it goes, so if you get the time, check back and let us know how it's going, and the sorts of things you find out.  xx","I definitely will keep in touch. As I said in my first post, it's not about money at this point as much as it's about the injustice. If my perspective and experience as a parent can help anyone, I'm glad to share any knowledge I gain. Thanks!","Hello,
Let me start by saying that I am a mother of a 15 year old daughter too so I understand how scary things can be when they develop maladaptive behaviors like using substances, cutting, suicidal thoughts or eating disorders to name a few.  Many teens experience low self esteem, peer pressure, bullying, trauma, addiction, depression, anxiety and do not know how to cope with such things.  An eating disorder may develop as a means to control the ""out of control"" emotions they are experiencing.  As a parent, I encourage you to keep talking to her.  Allow her to be open about the confusing time of adolescents and all that comes with it.  Allow her to discuss family dynamics and past experiences with you without judgment.  Allowing for open and honest communication free from shame and punishment can go a long way.  I am not saying you haven't tried this and more...
Additionally, I happen to work for an insurance company and deal with your frustration on the other side almost daily.  Insurance companies have medical necessity criteria that outline what someone has to exhibit to meet certain levels of care.  So, a Residential facility does an assessment and calls that clinical information in to the patient's insurance.  Clinicians take that information and match it up to the clinical criteria.  If a patient exhibits x,y,z then it warrants a certain level of care for treatment.  Clinicians ask questions to make the best decisions they can while considering many factors.  (How long has the issue been going on, what treatment has been tried, are there complicating factors, etc.)  If the clinical presentation does not meet medical necessity criteria then it is sent for an MD to review.  Insurance companies have internal MDs and consulting MDs(Third Party reviewers) to render these decisions.  They are all board certified and aware of the insurance company's criteria meeting certain levels of care (Inpatient, Residential, Partial Hospitalization, Intensive Outpatient). They are vetted and reputable companies that do these types of reviews.  If there is an insurance denial, please know that you have appeal rights.  Call the member number on the back of your insurance card and ask for an appeal or ask the facility to request one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When we talk about it she says she doesn't want to get better so therapy won't work. She refuses to discuss it with me because she has boundaries and I am not a therapist.  I tell her I have my boundaries too because I am her mother I can't stop trying to help her. We are in family therapy as well.  She cries or gets angry and I feel that this is consuming us. Any suggestions please.","Hi and welcome to the forum.   I am a daughter, a sister, an aunt.  A friend.   When I was at my worst, I did not want to get better.

When I was eighteen I was really only a child.  I needed my parent's love and care no matter how much I yelled and rebelled.  I do not remember rebelling and yelling.  I only remember wanting to lose weight.  And I went through a bulimic state as well.  Almost died from both.  Denial.  No I was never that sick.

                      iwanttolivealso, she is correct in saying if she doesn't want to get better she won't.  You can not make her want to get better.  That has to come from her, with the help of the counselor she will hopefully bond with.  Until I chose to want to get better, I stayed sick, for many, many years.  But there comes a time when one wants to get better and we can.  We can recover.   This is actually to encourage you.  She may not want recovery now, but one day she may.  Hold on to hope that that day comes soon.","Dear iwanttolive:
Thanks so much for sharing your feelings. I have a 20 year old daughter that has had bulimia for over a year. She binges and purges after every meal. I wish I knew what she was feeling. I have always supported her and been there for her. As far as loving her, she (and her brother) are my world. This disease is ugly and really changes the relationship. Some days she will confide a little, but will quickly slam the door and angrily tell me that I am not her therapist. I have learned that this is how she manipulates me and holds onto the disease, but it doesn't make it any easier. She can be so mean and say the most cruel things. I know this is to drive me away when I get too close. Thank you for saying that you still wanted your parents even though you didn't show it. So many nights I cry and grieve the child/woman that is lost.  She was in family and individual treatment but has since stopped both. I recently began seeing a therapist with a back round in eating disorders, she has given me the strength to set boundaries and still let her know how much I love her. She has agreed to see her primary doctor to have her labs checked. Hopefully, through my therapist I can help her find someone that she can confide in. Thank you for sharing your story and reminding me that although I can support her, it is still her journey. She will get better when she wants to get better. I only hope it is not too late.  This disease is very difficult on the family dynamic. My son and husband are angry and I am in the middle trying to keep the family together. I'm glad to hear you and your family have survived this nightmare...stay well and thanks again.","Hi and welcome to the forums. Please have a look at this Parent Tool Kit for supporting a child through their ED https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/sites/default/files/Toolkits/Par...and some helpful tips https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/blog/%E2%80%98parent-talk%E2%80%...also, https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/blog-tags/parents-caregiversPlease also reach out to the NEDA helpline available from 9-9  EST M-Th and F 9-5  800-931-2237We hope you continue to post!","Dear applemom:

119,03/18/2018,ShouldIletherliveoncampusatcollege?,"My daughter was diagnosed with anorexia (she restricts) 15 months ago. She spend 2 x 2 months in an intensive outpatient program and went back to school end September. Since then sees an eating disorder therapist, and a dietitian that specializes in eating disorders every 2-3 weeks. She is a high school senior and wants to live on campus at a college 3 hours from home.
We worked very hard with her and was able to get to what is considered a “healthy weight.” Since late January she slowly has been loosing weight again. Each time there is a different excuse, I'm sure you're all familiar with them. She feels she is no longer sick, she believes her weight is fine for her, we are all making too much of a fuss etc etc etc.
My girl is a senior in High School and looking forward to going to college. I, with her recent weight loss again, am really uncomfortable with her going away to college. Apart from her eating disorder, she is also vegetarian which makes finding quality nutrition in college even more difficult. Also, I would only be able to bring her home to see her ""specialist team"" twice per month at max. I am really worried she might relapse.
My girl and I have now come to some sort of an ultimatum... She needs to reach a certain weight within the next 6 weeks and then maintain without me making a fuss for at least 1 month. If she is able to do this, she can try college away. If she can't, she will have to live at home and do community college for a year since it will be too late to enroll in a different, local university.
I am still very worried and so is her therapist. Am I doing the right thing? Is it too early in the recovery progress and will I most likely be bringing her home sick again half way through the semester? Or is it good to give her this power?
Has anyone been in my situation? Any suggestions, comments?","Boy, it's hard to say.","Boy, it's hard to say.As you said, the fact that she seems unable to maintain her recovery weight is worrisome, particularly if she makes excuses rather than viewing it as an issue of concern.

Last September we allowed her to go away to college even though she was having trouble maintaining a healthy weight. She was there, she was down, she was there, she was down.

120,12/17/2017,14yearoldneedshelp,"Hello, this is my first post.  My daugther is in therapy for anxiety/anorexia/depression.  my husband and I believe she needs the next level of care.  We do not have the option of out paitien (i think it'scalled  partial hospitalization) due to our demorgraphic constraints.  nearest in patient residential treament facility is 3 hours away.  how do we know when it is time?  the last thing we want is to remove our child from her home at christmas, but we will do what ever is necessary to save her.  i realize no one can make this decision for us, but this ED is destroying our child and our family, and my daugther is suffering.","Hi and welcome to the forum. I am glad you came and posted.  First I want to say I am sorry for your pain in seeing your daughter suffering so much.  It is a very difficult decision to make.  As I do not know all the details I am unable to advise you but I can say my parents had me in treatment centers all over the country due to lack of good help in the state I am in.  When they say partial, I believe that is still not inpatient.  Residential is inpatient.  Or a shorter stay inpatient to medically  stabilize someone.  I was in residential and in a hospital and then in IOP's or intensive out patient, or PHP, partial hospitalization, which is after a IOP.  I am not sure about what level they want to have your daughter at.  Again my heart goes out to you as I see what my illness has done to my parents.  It is painful.  My parent's faith and mine is what has helped us keeping on keeping on.  If your daughter is in imminent danger I would go ahead and have her hospitalized.  But since I don't know how much of a risk it is, I would listen to what the professionals are telling you to do. Often our emotions get so messed up it is difficult to make a decision and the professionals can help you decide.  That would be my best suggestion.  I know it isn't much but I want you to know I understand as much as I can, your pain as I have been there and done that and am coming out of it finally.  I wish you the best.  Please let us know what you decide and remember to take care of yourself during this time, perhaps get some counseling of your own to help you deal with this horrible disease.  So, take care and I hope to see you around again.
                                                             iwanttolive","thank you for your reply.  My daugther has been in residential since January 8, 2018.  She is three weeks in today and it's a slow proess.  The weight restoration has been the ""easy"" part, the emotional healing is much much harder.  Her ED is loud and she has been struggling to hang on, it's just been in the last couple of days i've seen a glimmer of hope.  I pray she can regain emotional health and stablitly and that she choses her beautiful life ahead of her.","Hi jklexi1,
I am so sorry to hear about your daughter. It is hard to know what to do.It is good to listen to the doctors and also listen to your hearts. You know your daughter best. For us we took her to a doctor who did a physical check, blood work,  and checked her heart. She was the one that told us to get her into a residential care center. It was because of my daughters heart. Within 2 weeks we took her to a Center for Eating Disorders, It was so devastating to leave her there, One of the hardest things I have ever done. She was there for 2 months. My daughter and I believe that it saved her life. She was 15 at the time. She is now 18 and doing very well.
My husband and I use to say our goal for the day was to keep our daughter alive. That was a very scary time and so exhausting. It took a toll on our family. I was so caught up in trying to save my daughter that I did not take good care of myself. I was just surviving moment to moment. ED not only effected my daughter who had it, but her siblings, her friends, my marriage and our lives. ED can be so consuming to those who suffer from it and those who love them.
Please take care of yourself. I finally found my own councilor who helped me a lot. I finally realized that I could not save my daughter and I could not fix her ED, That helped tremendously. I could support her and love her, and she was the only one who could fight her ED and win. You are not alone and neither is she.","my 14 year old has been in residentail for three weeks.  I feel like we lived a similar nightmare.  thank you for your supportive reply.  it's a daily struggle.  her ED is loud and fighting her every step of the way, but we will never give up and are thankful for the treatment facility.  dropping her off was the hardest thing i've ever done in my life.  ED does effect everyone in the family and it's an all hands on deck approach.  i am learning about boundaries daily and trying to care for myeslf, but all i want is my daugther to be home and healthy and to chose to live her beutiful life.","Hi jklexi1,
I have been thinking about you and your daughter. I hope things are going well. How is she doing? How are you doing?
You are not alone.
2Joy2love","you are so kind to think of my daughter and her journey through ED.  She will be home on March 3rd and I'm scared to death.  We have no after care with in 170 miles one way, so trying to figure this all out has become a full time job in addition to my full time job.  We completeed ""family week"" this past week, so now when we visit her on Sunday's (3 hour drive to treatment center) we can at least take her off campus, it's been a life changing experience.  Ultimately it's up to my daugther to come home and chose to live.   We will support her every step of the way.  She's only 14 and it's so frightening to think of this being for life.  So, we just take it one day at a time and celebrate small successes!",I'm so happy to hear your daughter is thriving!  what a blessing.  ED does effect the entire family!  Do you have any advise for my for the first few weeks of my daugther arriving back home?  I'm scared.,"Very few parents look back and think- I wish I had waited to treat my child's ED.  Many regret that they waited too long.  But I've never heard anyone say that they should have waited and tried working it out at home.  I'm assuming that the ED developed while the child was living at home.  If the child developed the ED while away at school, the situation is different. But the longer you wait, the harder it gets.  And it does get much, much harder.
FYI- once you make the decision, you will feel so much better yourself.  For many parents, it is like a weight is lifted and your feel so much better.  It is kind of like you know you did the best you can do, and now you just sit and wait and see if it works.
Finally, once she turns 18, she can refuse treatment.  Make sure she gets treatment and that it is successful long before she turns 18.","thank you!  we didn't want to admit that we were powerless to help our daugther, but we were.  Our beautiful 14 year old has been in residentail for three weeks.  It's a slow process and her ED is loud and fighting her every step of the way.  We will never give up and are so thankful for the treatment center.",I am new to this site too but I have lived the ED life for the past 8 years.   We also had to make the decision just before Christmas to send out daughter to her 5th treatment program.   Someone said it before and I would agree get help asap and hopefully before your child turns 18 because after that you are just the parent and your concerns don’t really matter.   We have struggled for so long.   I wish I knew about this site over the past 8 years because we have had so many questions and had to make so many decisions and we felt so alone.   After reading a few of these posts I realize many of our stories are the same.   We didn’t want to pull our daughter from 8th grade so she did a partial program.   It didn’t work we didn’t want to pull our daughter from the High School tennis team but with a -4 bone density it would have been careless to allow her to play.   We didn’t want to tell her she couldn’t go to the college of her choice but she needed to live close to home because she wasn’t at her ideal body weight.   This past December we had her take her finals early and she left her sophomore year of college and had to withdraw from her Spring semester because we sent her to treatment which lasted 2 months.   We didn’t want her to miss Christmas and New Years and school but we had no choice.   She blames us for taking everything away from her but we were just doing what we thought was right and trying to keep her alive and healthy.   No one wrote a book and told us what to do we had to figure it out on our own.   My daughter has been home for 2 days and I am taking it hour by hour.   She is lonely and bored and doesn’t know what to do with herself because all of her friends are in college.   She interviewed for a CNA job yesterday and it sounds like she got it so hopefully we can try to get back to a new normal until she can get back to school next semester.    My husband and I felt we had to make the hard choices this time because something has to change.,"I feel for you. I too have a daughter that ""aged up"" and became a legal adult while suffering from ED. As parents, it so often feels there's nothing we can do, because sometimes there's nothing concrete or active we can do. We can't make our children eat. We can make them feel better. We can't solve this problem for them. All we can do is support them, be there for them, reassure our love for them.","I feel for you.

I have been thinking about you and your daughter. Having my daughter in a treatment center was so hard in some ways. Also it was a relief, she was safe, she would be eating and getting the help she needed. I wish I had taken the time that she was in the hospital to take better care of myself. To go out to lunch with friends, to do hobbies that I enjoyed, to find peace and to rest. It is great when they come home, and it is exhausting.
My daughter was a minor also when she came home. In ways it makes it easier because we legally can make decisions for them. My daughter goes to a family doctor now who weighs her and checks her vitals, then the doctor and I decide what to do. That has worked well for us. My daughter does not see her weight.
Also before my daughter left the Center we had a plan set up for her. That was very helpful. Please take care of yourself. You are not alone.

Welcome. I know this sight has helped me a lot, To be able to talk to others who understand what it is like to have a loved one consumed by ED. I hope things are going well for you and your daughter on her first day home.
I was given great advice from my therapist that helped me. I repeat this to myself and it helps me remain patient with myself and my daughter. ""I did not cause it. I cannot control it. I cannot cure it, She can cope with it."" It helped me tremendously. I could support my daughter, but I could not make the ED go away, only she could. It took off a lot of worry and stress from me. It also helped her realize that this was something she could conquer.
Good luck. Please take care of yourself. It can be so stressful and overwhelming, as you know.
I find that enjoying even small moments each day helps me find joy, peace, and even laughter.
2Joy2love","Thanks for your words of advice.   I will be reciting them as well.
During Family week the therapist looked at me and said you need to let it go....you can not fix your daughter you can only support her.   It was time for me to move on and take care of myself.   I have put myself and my family on hold as we traveled through this journey.   I realized on that day that my whole day revolved around my daughter and every conversation I had with my friends was about my daughter.   I sent an email that night to my friends and told them that I would not be talking about my daughter with them anymore.   That I was exhausted and couldn’t do it anymore.

First off that she is talking to you is very good. That she is able to share those feelings and fears with you. You are already doing good things in your relationship with her because she can talk to you. It is okay to acknowledge that this is how she is feeling. To respond something like ""I can tell that you are worried about your weight."" Then ask her why she is so worried. Just let her talk. As she talks just try to listen and she and you may discover what is behind this. You might have these conversations a lot and that is okay.

124,01/20/2018,"Questions,Venting,AndMoreQuestions","I’m new to this forum which I found while searching for answers on internet. The situation is causing strain on my relationship with my spouse- I’m sure that’s common. Subject of the problem lives full time with natural mother and 2 half siblings, older. At this point I’m refusing to even listen to my spouse discuss anything regarding the child because it is so frustrating to me. I’m certain that’s not a good solution but I’m at my wits end.
The child is a lifelong picky eater whose Mother is overweight. One sibling has normal weight, the other sibling is also overweight. As a child siblings and parents offered less than healthy food. Processed food a mainstay along with fast food. A sweet drink the norm for a 3 year old. Child had problems with constipation that resulted in painful bowl movements. Nothing was done to address the issue.
Diet was limited to a few specific types of processed foods. Or some sweet drink. Again, I have some experience with a child refusing to eat anything but a specific food. Never made an issue of it, continued to offer other foods, and the fixation on one food passed. Mealtime consisted of child being the main focus with every one present literally BEGGING the child to eat! And the child refusing unless given the exact food, always a poor food choice. I’ve never seen anything like it in my life, nor has anyone else I’ve spoken to. I’m not talking about parents saying, “ if you eat your vegetables you can have dessert” type begging/bribery. No this took begging a child to eat to new levels. The child was the MAIN subject of meals. Constantly the child, asking is that enough, and eventually resorting to tears. I’m certain it was as stressful for the child also.
Grocery shopping and meal planning revolved around the child to an extreme, all within earshot of the child.
Mealtimes were a nightmare. Constantly the begging and whining. Enough to drive the sanest person crazy.
I’m no mental health expert, however in my non educated opinion this family trained this child that food was power. Food was attention getting. Food gave them control over everyone in the household.
The child had numerous cavities in first teeth and several extracted for that reason. The child did not brush his teeth, and was most likely not properly instructed . At 5 years of age needed assistance dressing and tying shoes, all due to lack of parental instructions.
As the child got older the behavior persisted. Pediatrician noted the child as , “failure to thrive”. Ensure drinks added to diet. That was the extent of it.
All of this was a far cry from the way I was raised, and the way I was striving to raise my own children. I raised my children without diets, nor was the term used in our household. We stressed healthy eating. I’m far from perfect and we ate our share of less than nutritional foods. I strived to avoid making any comments regarding food, consumption, weight, etc, because of the comments made to myself and siblings growing up that resulted in problems for at least 2 of my family members. Our philosophy was to eat healthy nutritious foods and keep active. Your body will take good care of you if you take good care of your body. Simplified yes, but for raising young children it needed to be simple.
My opinion, for what it was worth was to stop making this a big deal. Stop BEGGING & CAJOLING this child to take another bite. Stop making this child and what went into their mouth the central focus of everyone’s life, daily routine, and activities. My pediatrician told me eat,y on that I would never control what came out of their mouth or what went in. Very true.
But alas, nothing was done and the behavior became entrenched, the begging continued unabated and became even more dramatic.
Now the child is 20 and has become so constipated that their bowel has nearly ruptured twice. The begging to eat continues, the over focused grocery shopping to find food that they will eat, cooking catered to this person, and the refusal to eat has now reached the point of causing heart arrhythmia. Every one shops and cooks with the consumers in mind, but the efforts on behalf of this person have always been exaggerated and over emphasized.
Now my spouse has dropped everything and is rushing to see child in hospital. Normal response, right? Except they do not see each other very often, rarely text each other. Consider that at age 11 child drew pictures of his Father and Mother together as a family and spoke of them all ‘Snuggling together.” Inappropriate at age 11, (eight years into our relationship, 3 in marriage,) considering father never lived with their mother, and there was never any possibility of that happening, Yes, as children we might hope for that, but to draw it in several pictures and verbalize it, despite being told more than once not an option. In this person’s mind, at least subconsciously, they have learned when they don’t eat to point of hospitilization, dad drops everything and comes and sees him. And Mom is there too, one big happy family.
Yes this person has anxiety issues.
I know I sound uncaring, but I no longer care to hear about this child’s issues because NOTHING was ever done. And nor will it. The child was allowed to remain in the custody of the parent who obviously failed miserably to parent this child. On my spouse’s part it’s a one way conversation, always ending with, “I’ve got nothing more to say”, or “I’m not talking about it”. For me it’s frustrating because one, it makes me angry that no one took care of this child- the mother left the sibling, 4 years older, to do the parenting. A 7 year old raising a 3 year old. And two, to constantly hear the same phrases that have never resolved anything. Personally I don’t know what to do other than keep my mouth shut so as to avoid another argument. When I remarked that this person is going to need intensive therapy by an individual trained in eating disorders I was met with the same remarks I’ve heard numerous times. There is no discussing this with my spouse. Maybe the solution is for me to just sit there and listen, at which time I’m accused of not caring or disinterest. I know this is stressful for my spouse and yet here I am complaining.
To me it just seems like this person was neglected a long time ago, and despite the crisis of the moment nothing is going to change ,","Dear JustChecking,","Dear JustChecking,You wrote :  ""Stop making this child and what went into their mouth the central focus of everyone’s life, daily routine, and activities.""","Dear JustChecking,You wrote :  ""Stop making this child and what went into their mouth the central focus of everyone’s life, daily routine, and activities.""While things may have reached a point where the damage is done, and many different things may have contributed to this, I think you may have hit the nail on the head with this comment.","Dear JustChecking,You wrote :  ""Stop making this child and what went into their mouth the central focus of everyone’s life, daily routine, and activities.""While things may have reached a point where the damage is done, and many different things may have contributed to this, I think you may have hit the nail on the head with this comment.One thing you might want to do is look up the term ""enmeshment"" and see if it seems to fit some of what you've observed.

125,01/07/2018,Stubborn20yranorexicdaughterrefusingtreatment,"My 20 yr old anorexic daughter came home from a semester abroad having lost significant weight. Nearly a year ago, when she weighed more than she does now, the counseling center at her college encouraged her to check herself in to a hospital or ED treatment center; she reacted by firing her therapist, psychiatrist, nutritionist and counselor. She claims she ""does not have an ED"" and her weight is ""only a few pounds below what it should be."" She no longer has a primary care doctor. At this point, all her friends are commenting and encouraging her to seek treatment.
The day after she came home she got diarrhea, which she assumed was the stomach flu (A friend was also sick, and I got sick too, so stomach flue seemed reasonable). Given her weight, we deemed the stomach flu to be serious, so her father drove her to Urgent Care, but she basically refused to be seen.
This morning, she flew across the US for an internship, and is now in an area where she has no friends or family, and still has severe diarrhea. Obviously, she should go to the ER, or Urgent Care or something.
I am hoping that her employer will require a doctor's note saying it is safe for her to work. I need to hope for something.
Given that I have spoken with a couple of her friends from high school (I don't know her college friends), is there anything else I can do? She is not talking to me, as she says that all I talk about is her weight. She is now a 5 hour flight away.

I am so sorry to hear about your daughter. It is so devastating to see your child suffering.
It also makes it harder when your child is an adult, because it limits what you can do, if she does not want to seek help.
I like what BobJ48 said about staying in touch with her. I know you are very concerned about her health and rightly so. Yet, it might be that the best way to reach her now is to not talk about her health but to connect with her through things that she likes. The idea that I have is to send her a package that has wrapped gifts in it. A gift that she can open up for each day of the month. So for February which has 28 days in the month, you would send 28 wrapped gifts so she can open a gift each day.  You can send a letter along with the package that tells her how much you care about her and that explains how you have sent her a gift for each day of the month. I do this with one of my college children that is going through a very hard time. Each day she unwraps a gift from me and she says it helps her a lot. I would stay away from all food, since that may make her feel like you are sending it to her just because of her ED. If she likes baths send her bath salts, if she likes to draw send her a sketch pad, ect. I found that it not only helps my daughter, it also helps me. As I search for gifts that I know she will like and as I wrap each one. I think of her and I feel like I am showing my love and helping her at the same time. I have now been doing this for 6 months, a lot of the gifts can be little and sometimes it is a note or quote that she gets. It has been very good for both of us.
Please take care of yourself. It can be hard to do when you are so worried about your daughter. I lost myself for a year when my daughter was in a very rough part of her ED. There were days that I was surviving hour by hour and some days moment to moment. Keep doing things that bring you joy and peace.

126,12/12/2017,iwanttolive,"Hi iwanttolive,
I have been thinking about you and I have prayed for you. I know the holidays can be rough.
My daughter is doing well. The holidays are so hard for her. She has been able to use her DBT skills and it is really helping. Especially when she fills out her card.
I hope you are enjoying moments each day. Thank you for your prayers for me and my daughter,
you have supported and helped me through some very hard times. Please take care of yourself. You will be happy to know that I am taking care of myself and I feel peace and joy each day.
2Joy2love",Hi. Thank you for thinking of me.  It means so much. Thank you.  It is good to hear of your daughter's progress. That is so wonderful.   I am doing okay. Hit a rough spot the last few weeks but I keep pushing forward.  I am happy to hear you are taking care of yourself.   I deal with persistent pain and depression.  And some other medical issues.  But our God is greater than any problem we face.   God bless you and Merry Christmas,Hi and good morning.   I was thinking of you and wondering how your Christmas went.  How are you?

I hope she did okay.  I had a little, big, medium sized slip.  But God is so faithful.  A very kind and gentle Pastor from Nigeria came three years ago to my parents church.  I was very ill at the time.  He spoke with me outside for three hours.  He wrote down what he said and I put it away discounting what he wrote.  Then he visited briefly a few months ago and said I have to see my Juli.   He is so sweet.  So we are in communication a lot over the phone, or by e mail or by text.   I have been sharing my latest struggles and victories with him.  For many years I have wanted to go to Romania and serve as a missionary in their orphanages.  Well, it looks like I had the correct vision, just the wrong country.  By November of next year I will be going to Nigeria and serve in the newly developing orphanages there.  My goal is three weeks.  God's goal?  My Mom thinks I will stay.  I just may.","Hi and good morning.   I was thinking of you and wondering how your Christmas went.  How are you?

                 iwanttolive","Hi iwanttolive,
I am so thankful that you wrote to me. Happy New Year's. I had all my children home and that was great. We were able to do some fun family traditions and even added a new one.
My daughter did better this holiday season than she has for the last 7 years. She still struggled a bit. And at the same time she has not had to go on suicide or even safety watch, which is a huge blessing.
I am sad to hear that you have had a hard time. I am happy to hear that you are not giving up. Please don't ever give up. You are not alone. You have family around you, I am praying for you and God is near. When life gets so hard and overwhelming it helps to ""look up"" to remember that there is more to life than just this moment. God is there and He loves us and wants us to remember Him. My worries seem to always decrease when I remember this.
One of my daughters tell me that being around children is very healing. I love that you will be able to go and help children. The pastor you are talking to sounds like he cares about you and others. I am so glad you have him to talk to.
We all slip and go backwards. Just remember to never give up. Keep going forward. Be kind to yourself. Beating yourself up about it won't help. Learning from the experience and knowing you can keep using your skills and you can improve a little bit at a time. Hope is so powerful. Remember to enjoy moments each day. Love life, yourself and others.

I had such a wonderful day today. I connected with each of my kids and my heart just sang with joy. I also got to eat lunch with my sister who lives out of state I just feel so loved by family.
I hope you are having a good week. That you are enjoying moments each day.
I am so glad you have found a therapist that you can connect with and is helping you in your journey. It is important to have someone you can talk to and someone that can help guide you. I have 2 children with PTSD and it can be so hard, especially not knowing all the triggers or how best to deal with triggers when they come. I hope and pray that you and your therapist can find what will help you.
I have also started seeing a therapist about 5 months ago. It has really helped me to have someone I can just talk to, I am the caregiver to multiple people and it helps me to have someone I can go to and get ideas from and that I can share my worries hopes, grief, and joy with.
Please take care of yourself. Continue to be courageous and not give up.

I'm out of strength and hope and totally defeated, literally don't know what to write...","Hi, welcome to the forums! I'm so glad you found us, and hope we can help. I'm so sorry to hear that your son has been struggling for so long...I can't imagine the toll that has taken on all of you. Have you reached out to doctors or other medical professionals like therapists for advice at all? It is my understanding that there are different reasons behind a child's AFRID, do you know what his is? (is it sensory, fear of eating, aversions to certain foods, etc). Im not a professional, but my suggestion, if you havent already, would be to seek some kind of outside help such as therapy. It might be beneficial, not only to take some of the burden off of you - because I can totally understand that you feel drained - but to get him on a path to healthier eating by determining the root cause of his behaviors. I hope that's helpful, keep us posted!","Hi, welcome to the forums! I'm so glad you found us, and hope we can help.

It is so heart wrenching to see your child struggle. Hope is so powerful. Keep searching for those who can help him. Also please remember yourself. It is hard at times to take care of ourselves when our child is in crisis. I lost myself for about a year when my daughter was so entrenched in ED. Others were very worried about me, I just was so overwhelmed, stressed, fearful, exhausted and I felt that it was my job to do everything right so she would recover. I finally got my own therapist who helped me out a lot. My marriage is stronger. I am so much happier, I am able to give of myself to all of my 6 kids. I would urge you to take care of yourself and to take time each day to enjoy moments. In even dark times and hard days, there are little moments that can touch our souls and give us joy. For me it is a beautiful sunset, watching my kids hang out together, holding hands with my husband, making chocolates, or seeing a child smile.
I would love to hear how you are and how things are going.

I hope you find the great help for your son soon!","ARFID in boys is often easy to treat, but you need professional help.  A residential or partial hospitalization program will change his life, and the entire family dynamics.  Good luck!!","<p>Just curious why you think ARFID in boys is often easy to treat? My 15-year-old son has been struggling with ARFID for 3 years. He has seen multiple doctors and therapists, and has been in intensive inpatient treatment twice (once out of state because there is no facility in our state that takes boys). We have spent tens of thousands of dollars on his treatment, and he continues his ED behaviors.  We have done everything we think of- therapy, medication, treatment- and nothing seems to work over the long term. It has been 3 years that we have lived like this, and it has been anything but easy- in fact, it has been a nightmare. We have so many questions and very few answers. We still don't know why he does this, though we are pretty certain it is tied to his chronic anxiety, which we are also trying to treat. At this point, we have been forced to the conclusion that though we will continue to do all we can,  there is only so much you can try to do with little to no results and not feel like a complete failure as a parent.</p>","I'm sorry to hear you have not seen more progress in your son's ED. It's so difficult as parents to see our children suffer, and being unable to do more for them or affect more change. It doesn't at all mean that you are a failure as a parent. We can't control the ED. We can't even understand where it comes from or why it stays. We can only do our best for our children and you are doing that. You said so yourself when you concluded that you must continue to do all that you can, regardless of results. On some level your son understands you are there for him, behind him, supporting him, in his battle against ED. I wish you the best in continuing to be there for your son. You are not alone and please don't ever give up hope.","Hi, we slightly edited your post to remove language about specific behaviors or content that could be triggering to others. You can find our forum guidelines here: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/forums/community-guidelines Please keep sharing!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our son successfully completed a partial hospitalization program at 13 yrs and is totally fine now.  The kids were there 5 days per week, all day, while parents joined once a week.  I know the gag reflex and the extreme slow eater thing.
All the kids were given a choice of a few different meals.  Eat one of the meals or drink a drink (I can't recall the name, but it was designed specifically for this kind of thing) within a certain time frame, which I think was 20-30 mins.  It seemed like forever.
In any case, it worked.  They can choose- gag on the food or drink the supplement, eat within the time frame or drink the drink (which does not taste great.)  That was the choice.  Period.
Try giving Noah the same choice and if he doesn't follow it, put him in a program now.
I have a second child whom I waited with and I cannot express my regrets.  It is so much easier to deal with EDs earlier than later. In addition, the issues with each effect all family members.  They feed off each others EDs, even though they are different types of EDs.  Good luck!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

131,12/12/2017,IOPversusPartialHospitalization(newhere),"Hi all,
Our 15 year old daughter was diagnosed with Anorexia about a month ago after a very rapid weight loss over the course of about six weeks.  Since the diagnosis, she has been under the care of a nutritionist/psychotherapist.  Her weight has essentially remained flat.  However, she has become more depressed and food-obsessed.  She eats but is very restrictive in what she will eat removing most carbs, dairy and a lot of proteins from her diet.  I am constantly trying to find new ways to get more of these into her diet.
Her labs are so far still good but her pediatrician and her therapist both agree she needs a higher level of care.  And her ped prescribed an antidepressant and referred her to a psychiatrist.
What they don't agree on is the level of care she needs.  The therapist wants her to go to an in-patient (or barring that partial hospitalization) program.  The ped says Intensive Outpatient is what she needs now.
We have appointments to tour both programs and in the case of the partial hospitalization program (12 hours a day, 7 days a week), also get an assessment.  I am concerned about having a kid who is a real homebody but also derives a great deal of pleasure (still) from her school environment moved to an institutional setting at this point. But I am also frustrated by our lack of progress.
I would really like input from people who have gone through either or both, or gone in a different direction.  Thanks in advance for your help.","Are actually both outpatient types of treatment.  Inpatient and residential are the highest level of care.  It sounds like inpatient, especially if she's not getting better or really able to care for herself while at home, is best at this point.  I am actually about to go into residential treatment next month myself.  That is my opinion.  Hope that helps.","Hi summersoul,
It is so hard to know what to do. We want to do what is best for our kids. When my daughter was 15 year old we put her into a residential center for 2 months. when she was released she went into IOP. For my daughter she needed the residential care. While she was there they did schooling, it was only partial day so she only received partial credit. She is now a senior and she will be graduating on time.
We were able to get her into a great program. She learned a lot of skills, my husband and I learned a lot of skills. She met with a dietician weekly and a therapist 1-2 times a week. Part of the therapy time was family therapy, over the phone mostly. They taught her about body image, about what Eating Disorders do to our brains, our emotions and our physical bodies. She was so fortunate to get to keep with the same ED center when she did IOP, that helped her a lot. Her IOP was about 3 hours a day 3 times a week.
Also you might want to check what the insurance will cover.
You can always try IOP and if that does not work you can look into residential. I think it is a great idea to look into both treatment centers before you decide what to do.
It is so stressful. Please take care of yourself, and realize that you are doing the best you can and you will make the best decision that you can.  You will have a learning curve about ED, and about what is best for your daughter. Best of luck. There is hope. I have learned to enjoy moments each day, it has helped me a lot.
My daughter is 18 now, she is maintaining her weight and she is making great progress in dealing with her ED and also in the other parts of her life that were causing her ED. There are still rough times and I am so proud of her for finding healthier ways of dealing with them.
Hang in there. You are not alone.
