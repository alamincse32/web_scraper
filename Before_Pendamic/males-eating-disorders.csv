0,10/25/2021,UnsureifIhaveadisorder,"My wife is concerned I have an unhealthy relationship with food because I count calories and macros daily. I do have a bit of body dysmorphia because of a lot of things:
When I was a kid I was very skinny as a wrestler, so that did harbor a negative relationship with food at a young age. College freed me from that and I put on a ton of weight rapidly. Then I lost a lot of weight to get healthier about 4 yes after graduation, which focused mostly on avoiding certain foods and exercising. And I was in a stage performance in 2019 where I lost weight to fit a vision, but I had the understanding that I wouldn't ever do that again once the show ended.
Since then I've just been counting to make sure I eat the right amount of food for my size, and keep things balanced. This to me feels like a more generalized idea of eating. I also exercise several times a week. I'm not skipping meals, though I do tend to skip a snack in the day and then binge later at night.","My wife is concerned I have an unhealthy relationship with food because I count calories and macros daily.

But what I would ask myself is to what extent these sorts of things are getting in the way of things from an emotional standpoint.  That would seem to be what defines "" a problem"" to me.
Also, what sort of level of anxiety or self-condemnation might you find yourself feeling if you strayed from whatever routine you have set for yourself ?  I think that's a measure of things as well.
In any case, just some things to think about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2,09/30/2021,DoIhaveaneatingdisorder?,"Hi guys, this is kinda scary lol.  Anyways I am a 19 year old male, a freshman in college.  I am reaching out because I am scared to talk to people I know in person about this topic.  I have not gone to the doctor about any of my mental health concerns due to fear of my parents overworrying about me which makes me stress out more.  If I say that I have a mental health disorder or imply that I feel like I have it, and I do not but this process offends anybody I sincerely apologize.
I have been struggling with what I feel is anxiety for years now, but it is not to the point where it messes with my functionality so I think i'm fine there.  I started having what i belive to be bipolar episodes in eight grade.  I go through phases where I am extremely depressed, but then something can happen and I will become extremly happy, but I am also more happy than sad so IDK if I qualify as bipolar.  Now with the eating disorder it has been going on since freshman year.  I would change my body to what other people wanted.  During football season I was a lineman and would gain weight to be at my heaviest.  I was 5 foot 5 at the time.  I would do this by stuffing myself full of food.  During baseball season however I would need to lose weight, the lowest I got during baseball was less than my heaviest and I was 5 foot 7.  The way I acheived this was by starving myself for 2-3 days while doing my atheltics.  Then I would gourge myself for a day, feel terrible and start over. I was so proud of the number on the scale, but still hate the way my body looks.  About 3 months ago I stopped starving myself and havent felt like this, but recently I have started hating my body again even though I havent put on any weight and I feel that I am going to fall back into that cycle.","Hi Kga63!

I am a high school swimmer who has been dealing with restriction and purposeful under-eating for a little over a year now. Though I am just entering my road to recovery, I definitely think my performance was hindered as a result of under-eating. Even just after 2 weeks of starting to consume more and challenging my thoughts, I've noticed a significant increase in my energy levels, speed, endurance, and overall disposition to swimming. Especially as a swimmer, we've been told to not eat before swimming to avoid nausea and stomach pain, and my disordered mind took that a bit too far.

Ever since then I've depended on stimulants to maintain my grades and body (as a college students that's basically my entire life) and I've lost a noticeable amount.

As a kid I was always known as the ""skinny kid"" since most of the cousins my age were heavier than me. Then around the age of 9, after the best cruise to the Bahamas with the grandparents, I came back a more fitting member of my cousins. Everyone made comments, some were mean, but my mom's left scars. It felt like I fell off a ladder I didn't even know I was standing on. I didn't do much about it, I hated my body, but I guess not enough until my freshman year of high school when I started using my prescribed medication (with some lovely side affects) to erase some history. Though, I never consistently took them until about 6 months ago. Ever since then I've depended on stimulants to maintain my grades and body (as a college students that's basically my entire life) and I've lost a noticeable amount. I'm starting to think it's less about my weight and more about the feeling of stimulants on an empty stomach, but beginning to feel satisfied with my body is another awesome high I've never felt.

11,02/04/2021,YoungAthletewithBulimia,"Hey everyone! I am currently at a residential treatment center for mood and anxiety and I just want to share my story of the eating disorder that has taken over my life. Feel free to share or reply with anything you feel comfortable with, or anything that you might relate to! I’m currently 18 years old and I have been struggling with my ED for a little over two and a half years. I have always struggled with self confidence, body image, depression, but one year it kind of took me to the point of starting to do unhealthy behaviors and it took over my life. About two years ago I was in a relationship with an athlete and being active was their life. Seeing them I always felt as if my body, my performance, or just what I looked like in general was not good enough. Subconsciously I thought that if I lost weight that is would be more likely that 1) I’d be good enough and 2) I’d feel better about myself. That’s when the target behaviors began, and it really took over my life. I was constantly thinking about food, counting every calorie, and restricting very extremely the day after I had had a target behavior incidence, or I would just do the target behavior every day multiple times a day. It was miserable. The person I was in a relationship with new nothing about my mental health or eating disorder, and for a while not a single person did so I just felt lonelier and lonelier and it got worse and worse. I thought losing weight would help but no matter how much weight I lost or what I looked like I was never happy. Being an athlete on top of all of this made it so much worse. Without getting any nutrients I made no progress with sports. I would be in the weight room 3-4 times a week for about two years, and I made no progress. With my ED it made progress practically impossible, and any time the weights did go up and I made any sort of progress, my ED got worse and I lost it all 20x faster than I made it. All my friends were lifting gettin bigger and stronger, and I was the only one who was lifting and getting weaker. Being a young male with the majority of my friends being talented athletes, it really didn’t help. I was embarrassed by my size, wether I thought I was big or small at the time, I was embarrassed by my performance, the weights I could lift, and pretty much everything. This was life, and it was only getting worse. I felt extremely depressed every day, guilty, and like a failure because I couldn’t control my eating habits. My girlfriend would make fun of me for not eating a lot and I would kind of just laugh itoff, but she had zero clue that the night before I had binged and purged significantly to the point where I didn’t want to even looks at food because I thought it would somehow make me gain weight. The day of my very first track meet I took off my shirt to change into a jersey and a couple guys told me “ you aren’t built for this sport” and I had a mom come up to me after words and say I was too skinny and I needed to eat food. I couldn’t win no matter what I did, and I still thought I needed to lose weight. I have a picture of me very thin and it was supposed to be the “ before” picture for a “ weight loss journey”. To me it was never the number on the scale even though seeing it go down helped, but I just was never happy with how I looked. The thought of my girlfriend having any affection towards me was impossible, just because I couldnt believe anyone else could love me just cause I don’t see any positives about myself. My last season of soccer was two years ago, last year was cancelled cause of Covid, and I am not able to participate this year because of my mental health. I feel like the ED has taken everything from me. I am still struggling, but I want to end this story with some positives. I am getting help. I am currently at a residential center and even though I still feel hopeless, it feels better just to be doing something about it. Eating disorders really suck, especially while you’re an athlete. No matter what age you are, gender, anything, just know you’re not alone. Asking for help isn’t easy, but I can say from experience that this is nearly impossible to do alone. Thanks for taking the time to read this, I hope everyone is taking a step towards recovery and making a change for the better.","I'm not sure if you meant this as a gift, but thanks for taking the time to post about your experience.
Even though we are supposed to know better, I think people still tend to believe that EDs are for women. But your reactions are almost exactly the same as what other ED sufferers go through.
 The ""good enough"" thing, and the lure of self-discipline really can draw a person in, in ways that seem reasonable to begin with, but which can begin to assert control over a person in the opposite way that they expected it to.
Plus like you said, when getting bigger seems wrong, and getting smaller seems wrong too, things really can start to feel mentally disorienting, and it can become hard to put much faith in our thinking at all.
You didn't mention if you were residential voluntarily, but just to say, the fact that you could list some potential positives, that's a good sign I think, even if things still feel hopeless at times.
Also, I hope you find that you are willing to take some risks while you are there.  I'm suspect you know what I mean, in that a person can be asked to do things that simply don't feel right at all, so being able to take risks, and being willing to believe that they might actually help move things forward, no matter how wrong they may feel at the time…if you find that you can take those risks, even if at the time it may feel like you are losing control instead of gaining it.  If you find yourself willing to experiment in those ways, despite what those ED thought patterns may be trying to tell you, then that may be a positive sign too.
Whatever the case, if you feel like writing some more, I hope that you will.  The whole recovery thing, it's like a mental journey I think, and like explorers of old, we can't always be sure where we are, but being able to keep walking forward, in spite of our doubts, that really is a lot of it I think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,05/16/2020,NotEating/LosingWeight,"Hi, my name is Patrick and I am 36 years old. I am reaching out bc I am losing weight regularly and not eating well. I haven’t ate well in about two months. I was losing weight during the winter and my doctor did tests on me. They all came back fine and well. I was healthy. Since March, I have not ate well at all. I consume little during the day and at nighttime and that’s bad. I lose a few pounds a week estimated. I fear swallowing and eating due to an episode back in March when i did choke on some food. I fear if I when I eat now I’ll choke, have heartburn, be bloated, or excessively burp. All of these symptoms are true to a degree. My doctor doesn’t seem to want to help me after a few months ago. My family is unsure how to help me thru this crisis of mine. I’m unsure what to do next. I did reach out to a counselor for help that’s a start. I should call my doctor back but what to say something but what. They will be horrified of how I look. My family is horrified of my appearance as well. My weight loss is the cause. I’m at a crossroads. I care about my health and want to get better. I’m unemployed for the past few months as well. Life has been a challenge a well. It seems to be better to be stuck in old ways and not care. Feel free to message me back with any thoughts or feedback would be appreciated. Thanks, Patrick","Hi yorkhaven36.

A person can find themselves being fearful that the same thing might happen again if they eat.

I got sick this year in February I had a flair up of my IC to where it is hard to eat any foods without getting sick. I have ate but it is not healthy I do not know how to choose the right foods because I am scared of getting sick. The recalls of foods scare me the ingredients is bad for me because of covid 19. I wanted the doctor to help me but they say I am healthy. Now I am afraid of gaining back the weight it is battle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,07/08/2020,Ican’tstopeating,"So I’ve always been bigger than I should be but in the last 10 years I’ve gained a significant amount I fascinate about food, I drive past a shop and think “they sell that” then I go and buy it all and eat it all. For example I could easily got to Morrison’s and buy way too much. Then eat it all in the car on the way home and then come home and eat something else. yesterday I did the above and then for lunch a really large meal, followed by a large dinner. I litteraley never feel full and never feel hungry. a few years ago I was lucky and got onto afitness programme the local authority was running which was 12 weeks of boot camps X times per week and lost some weight really enjoyed life. (I was lucky enough to do the programme twice) but then politics got in the way and I didn’t feel welcome there. move tried joining gyms but I got X or X times. I always feel embarrassed. I got into running and ran a few ks but then I hurt my shoulder and I can’t get back going, I always feel embarrassed the minute I see someone else walking. ive been to the GP many times over the years and told them I feel like an alcoholic would but with food, I was referred to a lifestyle programme but it’s one where after a few weeks they don’t want to be seeing you every week. I went back to the GP and was givenn medication but that didn’t work either. I’ve also taken medication on and off over the years with no joy. I joined a different programme for X months and put on weight I paid to go private and see a physiatrist but after 3 appointments all he was getting me to do was fill in food diaries so I didn’t go back. I really don’t know what else to do, I feel like I’ll never beat this and no one will ever understand my problem or be able to help me. I have a young daughter and I’m embarrassed to be out with her, I go on any rides at theme parks with her and it’s horrible. I feel shame, I know I need to do something but I just can’t motivate myself to do anything. Has anyone ever known anyone this stupid and can anyone offer and advice? thank you","Hi Antwire.Welcome to the forums!

In a way, you might be gaining comfort from your eating and maybe that all the foods you are eating coulbe be classed as 'comfort foods'. People comfort eat when they are stressed, depressed, hurt, embarrassed, ashamed, feeling guilty and the list could go on.... Much of your eating may occur in private – hence going to the shop, eating it all in the car and then going home to eat again. There is that secret element to this satisfying indulgence that will encourage within you a certain enjoyment. The question for you now is....How can you lose the weight, maintain that weight, increase your fitness and overcome your eating behaviours? There are many books, medications, therapies, treatments, fitness programmes....This list can go on. You successfully completed two 'boot camps'. However. What happens after that initial X weeks of intense diet and training? Then you might injure yourself running. As often happens, when an injury strikes it quickly puts a stop on the activity. You may benefit from different aveunues..... Consultation with an advisor. Fitness routine. Self help. Some psychological support. You could seek some dietary advice. You could benefit from a change in how you think and feel about yourself. Your struggles with you weight are not just about the physical side of things – but the mental state of mind as well. OK. When we embark on a diet and fitness campaign, we have these amazing expectations of ourselves. Feelings of guilt and shame can be associated with food and play a major part in the causes of our eating habits - especially any form of eating disorder. Some counselling may help you to explore your feelings of guilt and shame and may also help you to address the personal causes for your eating issues. Much of this can stem from life experiences. Changing how you think and feel about yourself may enable you to overcome those feelings of embarrassment and could be discussed in counselling. There are also books available on the subject of self-confidence. Having the motivation does take time and will power Admittedly. It's not easy, especially when you are trying to juggle it with your other life commitments. You'll learn that these changes may only at times be subtle, but can make a huge difference. What's more important is how you feel and value yourself - whatever the weight.","Hi PaulShipmanSmith, thanks for posting!

I know this is not treatment, but am looking forward to talk to people on similar circumstances and hear advice and how you are dealing with it. I have a therapist and even having a deep trust in her I do not want to tell her about this since I dont feel comfortable with sharing any of this with her, since I am very concearned about not being able to go back to the US and continue college if I tell her. I really want support and advice on how to procede since going back to college if really important to me, and I would do everything possible for me to return. I know my parents will support me in every step of the way, but i'd rather not tell them for now. I think my bulimia is not that bad, since I could go from one to three weeks without purging  without purging, but it also comes in waves I could be fine for one or two months until it stikes again.","So what do you think the situation is, or the concerns are, that triggers you to purge?

I'm a 29-year-old male (former competitive distance runner) who has struggled with a variety of eating disorders for close to the last decade.

At the present time, I'm dealing with what I know is a very unhealthy behavior pattern. As you might expect, those patters involve semi-frequent overexertion and injury. I've also developed an all-or-nothing mindset where I either am able to track everything I eat and hit my nutrition goals perfectly OR have very large binges.

Welcome to the NEDA forums! We would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove detailed descriptions of disordered eating behaviors, as well as calorie numbers, which are not allowed on the forums. You can review our community guidelines here. Thanks for your understanding and please continue posting! ","Im sorry you feel this way, I feel similarly- even the restrict/binge... I just kept saying to my different providers there might be an issue and now I'm starting treatment. I know i have more than other people may but if you don't go to any therapy maybe consider starting SOMETHING at least to talk to SOMEONE about this even if you can't find an ED place at first. I couldn't starting, the closest IOP is 1.5 hrs away but if you're ready enough you'll be able to get somewhere i hope",Nevermind,"Let me start by saying that I am kind of angry. With regard to Men with eating disorders, NEDA states all the obvious observations that I've seen stated for the last 12+ years. I.e... men with Ed's are ""under-represented"". Blah, blah... ""stigmas"". So why are we still at a stand-still on the topic. If anyone really cared about men with eating disorders, I would have expected to see advancements on the narrative by now. Instead, just more of the same repeated statements like the ones on this sight.
Add to that, at first glance (after an hour spent on the site) I do not see any information  or insights on the topic of eating disorders in the senior community. Sure there are upfront  statement about how Ed's cross socio-economic lines; gender lines; ethnicity  lines, but no mention of age lines. This exclusion of an affected demographic makes me so sad and disheartened.
I am a 57 year old male who has struggled with Anorexia for the past 14 years.
In terms of NEDA, I don't  even exist.","I have to say, this is so remarkably similar to what I have experienced myself, including the downplaying to my girlfriend. I truly do believe the first step is telling them, and seeking professional help. Getting said professional help allows you to identify the patterns which are harmful and need to be stopped, while having loved ones be aware of your struggles can help you kick those habits/behaviours. I have only been recovering for a few months really, but those are what I found were key. I wish nothing but the best for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I just have been spooked since people around me can talk about food they feel like eating, and I don't exhibit same level of interest that everyone I've met has in food.I don't have any psychological problem with eating as far as I can tell. Food is just sustenance for me unless it is food I like. But even in the case of food I really love, I don't think about it unless it follows along with my daily 3-meals-a-day need, rarely is it out of strong personal desire. I never get ""hunger pangs"" or get even close to yearning for any food. I may suffer a lack of interest as time, but I am not perpetually/consistently adverse to food.In conclusion, this seems to be more abnormal but not a problem - it doesn't necessarily ""get in the way"" of my day-to-day life. It is no longer a cause for concern. Thank you for your insights, they were helpful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,02/20/2020,Dysphagia,"So last summer I went through a period where I suffered a lot of trauma and an inordinent amount of stress and anxiety which has caused me to have chronic tension headaches, acid reflux, and feeling of tightness in my throat. The feeling of tightness has gotten so bad to the point where it is very uncomfortable to eat anything solid. I have not eaten anything solid since last month. My last full meal was Halloween 2019. I have lost a lot of weight since August 2019 to now. Doctors have done a CT Scan, bloodwork, an upper endoscopy, and a Barrium Swallow Test and found nothing. Still do not know what is the matter, but we think it might be my body stuck in tense mode after being stressed out everyday for months. I have been drinking high protein to keep some nutrients in my body but I wonder if there are nutrition plans online that can educate me on how the body changes after long periods of starvation and what steps I can take to reaccustom my body gradually to solid food without making myself sick.","Dear stanleyfromtheoffice, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove specific mentions of food, which could be triggering to other users.

Both pretty young, male, achieving personal successes, and letting crap thoughts about our body take up more real estate in our minds than necessary. Honestly, I don't have a cure-all solution for any of this, but I know what helps me when I'm feeling particularly down about myself is reminding myself that I am so much more than just my body. I am a unique body, with a unique skill set, that in0turn helps make other people feel good which ultimately is what makes me feel amazing. I am a photographer, writer, and graphic designer, and what I've been focusing on in the past few years is learning to let my art and my craft fulfill me more than a sideways long glance into a mirror would. You have a creative gift man––one that many would be jealous of. You get to perform live. You know how hard that sh*t is for some people? Your friends and fans surely aren't buying tickets to watch a body step out on stage and listen it hold a pitch. They want YOU, the soulful and creative YOU that lives inside your body that tiptoes out during each performance and touches the heart of everyone in the audience in a different way. You are the deliverer of so much inner peace to so many people and you shouldn't be left out from that!
There isn't a single solution to overcoming the low self-esteem you've been feeling recently, in my opinion. Good Self esteem that takes practice, time, and a drop-dead honest group of friends. (Im not a doctor, just to be clear, and the advice that I'm about to offer is what has helped me in the past and present and might not work with you!) What helps me is creating small habits that help me feel my best. I try and exercise most days of the week, not with the intention of altering my body, but to feel the good rush of endorphins that comes along with it. I too feel that I have bigger than average legs, and this might have been because I rowed in college, but I don't let that thought discourage me from taking care of my health. I also really enjoy making random gifts for people, which helps me flash some of my creativity (self esteem +) and helps someone else feel thought-of and loved in return.
I turn back to this question when I hear the internal chatter get pretty dark: What would my response be to a close friend if they expressed such thoughts about their body/themselves out loud to me? I have been trying to treat myself as someone that I've loved, to grant myself grace for any supposed shortcomings that I have (or that I have believed to have been said about me at a point in time) and to uphold all the beautiful things I've created and to continue pushing forward towards the things yet to come with gratitude and a healthy dose of pride. You are brave for stepping in front of the audience, don't forget it!","Hi Jake,
I really feel for you.  My son is now 15 and is an amazingly passionate, perfectionist who has always thought his torso was too fat and has struggled with this. He now has orthorexi and exercises for specific body image and is focused so much on this.  Of course everyone comments on how great he looks but inside he is miserable.  His whole life revolves around this.  ","Hi Jake,

20,12/08/2019,Letthehealingbegin,"Good day and Blessings to all. I have been dealing with emotional bingeing and purging. I used to beat myself up mentally with shame and regret. Now I am educating myself on the seriousness of this unhealthy coping cycle. I ceased my bingeing and purging episodes for a year or so until recently. As my grandmothers dementia worsen, family cohesion crashing, anxiety increases, and for some reason I have the worst negative thinking that does not seem to come from my heart but it's very judgemental. I start to feel drained mentally and even physically at times. B/P does not make it better as a way of coping. It will only deteriorate the mind body and soul. I understand that i have to fix the root of this cycle to heal completely. Pain is okay. Suppression is not. Understand that there are deeper consequences than emotional regret. The physical damage can be life threatening. My body needs me to get a grip and extract this demon. My mind needs me to free it from chains of regret. My soul needs me to nourish it with peace. I need me to Love My Existence more. We all do. Now let your healing begin","Hi.  I am sorry to hear of your grandmother's dementia.  It is very difficult to watch someone we love suffer.  You have a lot of good insight.  Are you getting help with in dealing with your grandmother and how it is triggering the eating disorder?  I hope you decide to get help because as you said, eating disorders are life threatening and you need to take care of yourself at the same time your grandmother is going through her health issues.   I really hope you get support and help and do what you need to do to stop the as you said, the suppression, through old coping ways that are very harmful.  Please take care.","Hi.

It may be scary or embarrassing, but we all struggle with something and shame should not factor into your getting help.  Eating disorders are life threatening and if you think it is out of control I urge you to seek some sort of help.The type of insurance you have will also have an impact on what type of program you may be able to go to.   I know I just threw a lot of information at you.  Hope it wasn't too overwhelming.  I also hope it helped some.  You may never get to this point because you were upset by my initial questions, but I asked them because I have been dealing with the eating disorder a long time and understand family dynamics a lot.  I wasn't trying to be too personal.  You don't even have to answer them on the forum.  They are for you to think about.  So, if you want to, let us know how you are doing.  I'd like to here how you are.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Don't you know how high the rate of alcoholism is in the senior population.  I say that to let you know that people just don't realize that any age, any color, any gender, any economic back round or race do struggle with the same things.  Things like mental illness or eating disorders for staying on topic do not discriminate.  For so long, there were only females in treatment facilities.  For the most part this is still true today.

But, I'm here to lend you a friendly reminder that you are not alone! This whole forum is filled with people experiencing a journey similar to your own. Always remember that everyone here can help you, but so can a specialist. Have you tried reaching out to the helpline on NEDA or the chat now thing? They could help you just as much, if not more than everyone on here.
I'm sure if you contact some sort of dietitian also, you could ask them how you can safely give up the ED and how to do so without gaining too much back at once. My personal advice would be progressive re-emersion into eating. (Like, starting off with smaller amounts of food and moving onto regular portions so your body has time to get used to the food) I hope that makes sense :/ However, I'm no professional, so don't take my advice to seriously.
Reach out to someone because this journey of recovery could get lonely.. We're here for you and want to help
If you see this message, try and keep in touch perhaps?","We aren't allowed to mention numbers.   It looks like the administration's deleted these numbers in the first post, as they are triggering.

29,08/07/2019,Recovering,"I was just wondering if anyone is recovering on their own. For me i find that when i allow myself to take as much time as i need to do certain things my stomach is more receptive to food. The only problem is that this proccess is both healing but also agonizing. It would take me forever to get up in the morning, for example. I guess the best way to explain it is like a walking meditation, or eating meditation and kind of feels more like a relaxed lethargy. This is where it would take a long time to do a certain task. It's very affective and healing because i become very conscious of my body, but i end up falling back because it can be so daunting and i just quit and stop eating all together. I haven't fully completed like a week or couple days of it even though i know this is the best way for me to recover. I've been dealing with my ED (alone) for so many years. I've tried many different ways to recover and i would just love for it to be over. I am not that good at explaining it but I was just wondering if anyone was going though the same proccess. Also, this place has been so helpful. They really get it. I called for the first time yesterday and i appreciated it so much. It inspired me to write this which I've never thought id do. Thank you everyone and have a happy recovery.","Hi, thank you for posting. Please take a look at our community guidelines here: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/forums/community-guidelines.

30,07/18/2019,OptionsinPAforBDDandED,"My earliest accounts of suffering are at the age of 14. I am now 23. When I was 19 I received a diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder. Just a few months ago I was diagnosed with an eating disorder. It is hard for me to write here because my perception of myself has made certain aspects of my life much more difficult. The best way to explain my situation now, is to touch base on the past few years. I became extremely self conscious at 14 after I developed cystic acne. I mean, it was just unusual. It led me to skip school, not look people in the eye, and just socially withdraw from almost everyone except my family and girlfriend who acted as both a lover and best friend. The times I was in school, my ""friends"" would say out of shock ""OMG did you get into a fight""... or times at fast food restaurants there was a sudden conversation about how greasy foods affect your skin; probably started by looking at me then ended with suggestions on what I could do to improve my skin. Well, thankfully my mom took me to a dermatologist. From that first appointment until now the remedy has been the perscriptions they provided me. Its important to note that since I was 17 my acne has been under control, which I am beyond thankful for. My self consciousness was not just limited to my skin. I also despised my nose. I mean despised. I remember getting into countless fights with my parents and girlfriend over financing for it. Told my therapist how uncomfortable it made me and swore that I would eventually have plastic surgery to fix it. Well, that still hasn't happened. My senior year (aged 17-18) I ended the relationship with my girlfriend after 3.5 years together. I cared about her deeply but felt that I was indeed attracted to the opposite sex. So, I came out. It was relieving and I could not have asked for a more supportive network. However, upon coming out... it left a lot of questions for me to answer from others. ""Are you the 'woman' or 'man'"", ""You do not LOOK gay"", ""You are a failure at being gay"". These questions in association with ""suggestions"" on how to improve on being ""gay"" just really hurt me. I know that being gay, liking the same sex, has absolutely nothing to do with the way you look or behave but there is infact this stereotype I struggled to deal with. I had a lot of remarks about my hair. I was shaving it but after suggestions on to grow it out, I tried. I mean tried. After a lot of research I ended up going back to my dermo. with the complaint and she gave me some perscriptions. I truly want to say, it has in fact done WONDERS.i While yes, my hair condition was being handled. I still was receiving this ongoing feedback regularly on how to improve my appearance (even writing this I just cannot understand why their was so much emphasis on my physical appearance in relation to my sexuality but their in fact was). I remember hearing from multiple people that I was a ""failure at being gay"" because I did not look a certain way, like certain things, etc.. Underlying all of this was this ongoing preoccupation with my appearance apparently people did not perceive I was concerned about; when I actually was. In January 2017 I started to go to the gym. Where I currently am, I work at a gym. My peak was Sept-December 2018. I had lost over X pounds however gained a lot of lean muscle. Truth was I was exercising all the time plus restricting my calorie intake. At my lowest I was Xlbs 5'4"". Around November 2018 I knew the holidays were here and I wanted to eat. I honestly forget where I saw it but that was when I started taking laxatives. It's so embarrassing. After overeating, I fast. This is still going on and I do it out of pain. I feel like I am just so ashamed of my physical appearance. I am always hungry. Probably because of how much a train + the emotional turmoil of it all. I went to my doctor a few months ago, told her my concerns. She knows I have been struggling (in 2016 I was diagnosed with BDD after an involuntary hospitalization). She diagnosed me with an eating disorder and referred me to a nutritionist. They both felt like I need impatient but it was in the middle of my semester. I still struggle everyday with food, binge eating, fasting or using laxatives. All for a compliment... I need help but I am so concerned with this derailing my graduation in May. I also cannot afford to take off work. Please, what resources are available for me?","Hi, JMC41996. Thank you for posting.

31,04/19/2019,Ifeelinvalid,"I keep fluctuating in terms of how much I want to recover and how much I want to restrict; it makes me invalid because I keep saying to myself, ""If you REALLY had an eating disorder, you would want to restrict all of the time!""

I just want to ay that I hear you.  But having incisiveness over recovery, wanting to recover and then fearing it is normal.  Eating disorders serve a purpose most of the time.  For me, I was so afraid of people, of being hurt, of just living a regular life, I thought it was easier to just live sick, in hospitals and programs and avoid life.  Well, I eventually had to face life, face my fears.  So for you, figuring out what purpose the eating disorder is serving is essential to overcoming it and this us usually done with the help of a therapist.  So many people suffering with an eating disorder discount the validity based on a number.  Unfortunately insurance companies use numbers but there is something called eating disorder otherwise unspecified.   I think.  It means that you may have anorexia, based on your fears of food, thought patterns and behaviors but since you started losing weight at a higher weight your weight loss doesn't put you in the underweight category.  You may face all the other symptoms that comes along with anorexia.  Atypical anorexia I think is another way to identify it.  But ultimately a term will never identify your exact experience, pain, struggles, fears, whatever you may be feeling.  So try not to get hung up on that so much.  See if you can get help for the underlying cause of the eating disordered behaviors and know you are not the eating disorder.  You are separate from it and it does not define you. You are so much more than any diagnosis.  See if you can get help for the pain it is causing you.  Take care,","Hi.  I just want to ay that I hear you.

33,01/05/2019,Unhealthyeating17yearold,"Dear readers. I am 17 years as of tomorrow. For almost aslong as i can remember i have grown up with my dinner being fried foods. Still till this day i have that atleast X times a week. The other days i have no dinner as i work and would rather not eat than eat that. I know it is bad but to what extent i dont know. Other than dinner i eat almost nothing as i never feel hungry, if i do eat it is junk food as i work at the cinemas. No vegetables or fruits either. I do try to drink alot of water though. I am pretty skinny around Xkgs and height probably around 185cm (around 6 foot i think). I would love to know how this would affect my future when im older or know any other facts. I try to be more healthy but in general i do not like the texture of other foods. Any help will be heavilly appreciated as right now some of my friends say i wont live to 30... :/ :( and i dont know what to do","Hi, andrew-harris -- welcome to the NEDA forums.

Everyone says it’s a good thing and that I look good, but I have a hard time trusting them when all I’ve known my whole life is that more weight is bad, and I see myself getting bigger. I wanted to talk to someone who could relate and ask them if restoring weight is actually a good thing?","Hi wolde123! Thank you for sharing your story. ED's are a tough thing to navigate, aren't they? Restoring weight, from what we are told, good thing but also very scary. We aren't doctors here, but many of us on the forums have experienced that same ""dread"" of gaining weight. As part of your recovery, are you seeing a therapist? In my recovery, it was/has been difficult for me to overcome my ED because I also suffer from OCD and depression. Obsessing over calories became a controlled behavior for me, which I wouldn't have been able to get through on my own without some professional help.

40,12/11/2017,20yearoldsonsupersedentaryandovereating-ScaredMom,"I just joined this forum as I was looking for IOP and inpatient treatment for men with eating disorders.  My 2o year old son will spend all day horizontal in bed on electronic devices only to get up to drive for take out or Chinese food.  He has been treated for depression since he was 6 years old (father bipolar).  He is on the highest dose of an ADHD stimulant which should curtail his appetite and give him some energy.
I think he is slowly committing suicide.  He is treated by the top psycho-pharmacologist, and highly recommended outpatient therapist.  He has had a sleep study and full battery of psycho-social testing.  I have raised him in a (divorced) home that has modeled good eating (not crazy) and regular exercise and solid work habits.
I just yelled at him out of concern.  As a parent I cannot watch what he is doing.  I asked him what it would be like if I spent 22 out of 24 hours in bed and ate only unhealthy food all day, he said he would be worried.
He's a great, nice, smart kid.  But he is lonely and I know he is not happy with how he looks, he hides in a big coat all day inside the house.
Can anyone relate or advise?  I know things won't change until he wants them to change.  Just super hard to watch as a mom who loves her son.","Hi Kimba1505, welcome to the forums!

Users are discouraged from posting outside links that have not been previously endoresed by NEDA itself. Thank you for your understanding. And as always, the community guidelines can be found here: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/forums/community-guidelines","Hello, I know it's not of much comfort, and i have no great answers, but know that people care and hear you.  I can sense your utter loss of what to do and where to go. Yes, i'd say that my ED did not exist separately from my clinical depression and anxiety disorder, and that story of your son's struggles sounds very much like what was my experience during some periods in my life.  I don't know if I should say the name of a specific treatment center, but a pretty simple search-engine question could point you in the right direction.  It SOUNDS to me, from the outside, that you ARE doing a great job helping him, and you then must know that Depression is a tough illness to crack and beat.  My personal struggle was a lot like his, in that i gave up on life, and sort of lived IN my depression and anxiety and eating disorder, and had no fight left in me to even hope for hope. I even went back to college with the effed-up plan to LIVE IN and WITH my ED, depression & anxiety. I cared more about being sick than being well, and there's no amount of goading, anger, love, warmth or whatever that will heal him.  It must be like watching a person struggling with cancer, who refuses to get medical help for it. But that's ironically a SYMPTOM & CAUSE of the illness: it WANTS to win, and do so by failing it's carrier. Diabolical manipulative illness it is, cunning, baffling and powerful.  It's thought that the internet, facebook and the like have CONTRIBUTED to so many young people's emotional struggles, but i don't want to advise you on that issue either.  You may even need to get your own therapist, and trough a referral from HIS doctor.  Th tough and catch-22 of having depression and anxiety, is that it's a self-fulfilling prophecy:  You're depressed and being depressed, keeps you from not being depressed, if that makes sense. Likewise with anxiety, HAVING it makes it so hard to FIGHT it, and the anxiety, like depression and an eating disorder, has, as part of it's very demonstrated make-up, a self-preserving disease.  The illness puts you at odds with healing, when it fights to continue that path it makes and wants to follow. For ME, the fact that my parents sort of gave-up on me getting better, as i had given up on myself.  That's the toughest part, and i feel your pain and frustration, bc you can't fix it, ameliorate it, or even provoke your son to.  BC your son is smart and aware, you should know he KNOWS you do care, in his clearer moments of clarity. The life you made and grew and nurtured is fading, and you cannot so easily save him from himself. I'm kind of rambling here,, You should know that my parents finally, in a Tough Love move, MADE me see a mental health specialist.  I'm not sure where you live, your insurance coverage, or even if it's the right thing to do, but i'd see if you can schedule an appointment with his docs, though they might not see you, bc of the patient-doctor confidentiality clause, but you could ask a professional if maybe in-patient treatment is a best choice.  My first time in an eating disorder unit, i was forced in. I fought it and them. The second time, i fought for ME. You can no more MAKE HIM get better, than MAKE HIM *WANT* to get better. Find a support group for people with family members w/ mental illnesses, and connect w/ other parents who are in your same shoes. There are MILLIONS of them, not that that's a comfort to you. It's sad and angering that YOU are effected by an illness you don't even have, and he cannot & will not fight to fix. What I WISHED MY parents told me in MY particular story, was that they LOVED me, wanted the best for me, and would have asked how they could help.  But other than being there for me, they couldn't pick of the pieces of Humpty Dumpty me, and put me back together again.  LIke a person's cancer requires an Oncologist, an emotionally ill person needs a head doctor.  You can no more heal him than you can heal cancer. Know it's NOT a choice, though it SEEMS like he not getting out of bed IS his intentional choice : if he COULD chose, from the perspective of he wanting the best for himself, he'd do it. We have to accept sick people as where they are, not where we want them to be, as healed. Be kind. Be progressive and proactive. Ask. Tell. Find support and especially find some for YOU too.","I rambled, but hopefully you got something out of it. The hardest battle is within us. Thoughts and prayers out to you and your son. You're a good mother, person and i'm sure he knows that.","Dinodog41 your ""rambling"" was helpful to read. Reminding me what my son needs from me as a parent was what I needed to hear.  I have him connected with a psychiatrist for meds and a therapist for figuring stuff out.  He had gotten his head above water in the past year regarding the depression with some med changes and a good 6 months with the therapist.  He accepts his depression and takes responsibility at least for taking his meds every day.  He does know he is not living a healthy life but is unable to choose any differently right now.
I am sorry for your struggle; and am very appreciative for the wisdom you can share as a result.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Welcome to the forums, I'm glad you found us. :) Each situation is unique, but I was very nervous to tell anyone about my eating disorder, too, for fear they would judge me or wouldn't understand. For 6 years, I never told a soul. But I can tell you that EDs like to thrive on isolation, and tend to creep back in when we're feeling alone...so I applaud you for wanting to put an end to this period of silence. You're refusing to let that ED win! I started out by telling very close friends and family, and I found that, although many of them had a hard time completely understanding the complexities of eating disorders, they were all extremely supportive and wanted to be there for me in any way they could. Of course you can never be certain what kind of response you might get, but even if it's not quite as positive as you'd hoped, i do believe it gets easier and easier to talk about the more you do it. You just have to take that first leap! Even just sitting down with a friend and saying ""hey, there's something I've been having a tough time with - could I talk to you about it?"" Or if that's too daunting, you could write a letter instead. Either way, I'm proud of you for reaching out for support. You got this!","Hey Lstrode!
