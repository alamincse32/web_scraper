0,07/10/2018,BingeEatingRecovery,constantvigilance,"Sup, everyone. This'll be my first post.So I've been struggling with binge eating since 2012 now, and decided to do something about it in 2017. It's never shown physically because I like to keep fit.I went and got therapy and have been actioning the steps. They've worked for the most part, but it's so hard. Sometimes I won't even use them because the urge is so hard to get rid of. It's overwhelming. I have goals in life and fitness but in that moment, then and there, nothing else matters. I just want to be filled with food. In the following days, my productivity is at an all time low.I'm trying so hard with the dealing with the urges, but they accumulate (e.g. I'll deal with them one day, then they'll come back stronger the next). I want to get out of this. I'm scared to let people outside my family/past therapists know, and I don't go out drinking with my friends because I'm terrified of gaining weight through excess calories. I've no idea what to do anymore. I just want to stop doing it. Bit deep, but that's the truth, lol.",Vinnymac69,"Tue,12/25/2018-11:24pm","I’m a very fit and strong guy and I eat fairly healthy, but when it comes time to eat with my family I splurge. In my case, I found it easier to not overeat by drinks tons of water. I’m still sturggling with binge eating so I can’t give you a good solution lmao. I hope you the best.",Homersapien,"Sun,01/20/2019-11:01am","I would never recommend this for most people, but yes - drinking does help. It's a 'better than' sort of scenario in my case - better to drink plenty of tea than to lose control over my diabetes by binging.First, though, you have to make the steps. Even baby steps help. The longer you go without binging, the less likely it is that you'll continue. Have you got any areas you'd like to work on?",adagio,"Thu,04/04/2019-2:41pm","Hey Constantvigilance. Firstly––I love your username. It's a good way to describe the mindset one must have when overcoming these sorts of challenges.  I am also a pretty active guy who enjoys the competition fo sport, and too, someone who caves now and then and binges. I don't like when these episodes happen because they mess with my energy and concentration levels. I totally get the feeling of ""want to just be filled with food"". In my experience, when I start to have these thoughts I ask myself, ""am I overdoing it on the fitness? Am I fueling my body enough to keep up with my active life? Am I setting aside time to let me body and mind rest?"" I'm still learning to accept this funny fact that the body and the mind are wound up in a crazy web of connection, and that they communicate with each other. As an athlete, I was taught by a few of my coaches to ignore the symptoms of the body, that, ""if you're sore/tired/exhausted-beyond-belief you're doing it 'right"" and that ""the point of sport is to master your mind and learn to control your thoughts.""  What ended up happening to me is that I would ignore my boy's symptoms (soreness, fatigue, sickenss) and keep pushing forward because that's what I believed to be 'right' way to manage training. But my mind caught up eventually, and I began to overeat. I would get so frustrated with myself because I thought it was my ""weak"" mind that was giving up. So I up'd the intensity and continued on with training. But again, I would binge, and I would pity my lack of discipline. What I was missing was the unavoidable fact that I wasn't listening to my body's needs, which is still something that I struggle with to this day. I'd look at my other teammates and see them train just as hard as me, and not experience any struggles with binging (as far as I knew) and I would think low of myself. But instead what I should have done was just accepted the fact that my body has different needs than my teammates and that I need to respect them. I don't 'have' and body, I 'am' a body––which means I have to think of my self (mind, ego) and my body as one unit that is connected (like I said earlier). Now,
when it comes to escaping the black hole of a binge episode, there are tricks that have worked for me in the past in certain moments but have also failed me in others which is why I recommend you make a list of multiple things that help ease your mind and your body!
On the top of my list is talking. I'll pick up the phone and call a friend. Being social helps me reduce my anxiety. I don't normally tell my friend the battle that I'm fighting on my end because I'd rather talk about something else to get my mind off the matter. I try and call my funniest friend because laughing is the best medicine.  If no one is free to chat, I love to write. It helps me to remove myself from my apartment if an urge is particularly bad, so I'll literally grab my notebook and pen and sit in the main lobby of my apartment building and write. Going for a walk is another one that I like, but I tend to do it less frequently. Lastly, plugging in my headphones and lying down with my favorite songs/playlists is so strangely calming. I've even made a playlist that helps me fight the urges to run to the cabinets. I pick songs that remind me of my friends and family. I pick songs with lyrics that remind me of why being my best and healthiest self matters and that we are never alone in this struggle. These are a few things that have worked for me, but I recommend you come up with your own list! It isn't a perfect list, because sometimes the urge just gets so insane and I succumb. Its embarrassing sure, but I'm reminded of my humanity, and I try my best to wake up the next morning with the intention of just being better than yesterday (which sounds cheesy, but once you think about it, it makes so much sense). I hope these words help man!Adagio",Harold4327,"Thu,07/30/2020-2:58am","Hi. I am just confused about the binge eating effect on your life. I've seen many people discussing about binge eating.

1,07/11/2019,TreatmentOptionsforLong-TermED?,todded,"Hello all, This is my first post in this (or any) eating disorders-related forum or group. I'm a 29-year-old male (former competitive distance runner) who has struggled with a variety of eating disorders for close to the last decade. For me, disordered eating started with extreme caloric restriction for the first few years, followed by years of back and forth between binge eating and periods of restriction. At the present time, I'm dealing with what I know is a very unhealthy behavior pattern. As you might expect, those patters involve semi-frequent overexertion and injury. I've also developed an all-or-nothing mindset where I either am able to track everything I eat and hit my nutrition goals perfectly OR have very large binges. More often than not, I find myself ""staying on track"" during the workweek, then bingeing during the evenings of each weekend, often surpassing X calories on days of binges. Intellectually, I know I'm doing short and long term damage to my mind and body (which, at moments, is utterly terrifying), but I find myself cycling through periods of motivation and utter hopelessness and am at the point where I know I need outside help (in some way) to begin on the pathway toward some kind of recovery. Does anyone have thoughts or recommendations about where and how to start? My spouse has some idea of my challenges with food, but I've largely played down the fact that this is still a prominent issue in my life. Additionally, I'm not sure if I should consider some kind of out- or in-patient treatment, possible medications, or therapy. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.Thanks!todded",_admin_moderator,"Thu,07/11/2019-2:18pm","Hello! Welcome to the NEDA forums!

With regard to Men with eating disorders, NEDA states all the obvious observations that I've seen stated for the last 12+ years. I.e... men with Ed's are ""under-represented"". Blah, blah... ""stigmas"". So why are we still at a stand-still on the topic. If anyone really cared about men with eating disorders, I would have expected to see advancements on the narrative by now. Instead, just more of the same repeated statements like the ones on this sight.
Add to that, at first glance (after an hour spent on the site) I do not see any information  or insights on the topic of eating disorders in the senior community. Sure there are upfront  statement about how Ed's cross socio-economic lines; gender lines; ethnicity  lines, but no mention of age lines.

2,02/20/2020,Dysphagia,stanleyfromtheoffice,"So last summer I went through a period where I suffered a lot of trauma and an inordinent amount of stress and anxiety which has caused me to have chronic tension headaches, acid reflux, and feeling of tightness in my throat. The feeling of tightness has gotten so bad to the point where it is very uncomfortable to eat anything solid. I have not eaten anything solid since last month. My last full meal was Halloween 2019. I have lost a lot of weight since August 2019 to now. Doctors have done a CT Scan, bloodwork, an upper endoscopy, and a Barrium Swallow Test and found nothing.

Because yeah, it does sound like stress to me, and while I'm not you, it sounds like you are probably still stressed out now ?   Would you say ?I suspect that there are diets that help people gain weight back in ways which are not dangerous to them.  Because yeah; sometimes a person can get into medical trouble if somehow they just start chowing down after they've been starving themselves.

""Golly, you just need to  loosen up"".   That may sound like a big cliche too.Even so, these might be the next areas that are worth looking into ?Sorry if this reply doesn't help any more than the non-answer from the NEDA person did, and perhaps you've already given though to these things.

Part-time musician, full time ball of self-doubt.I was overweight as a child and compensated for that by being the class-clown amongst other forms of coping, i.e fashion in attempts to make me feel more confident -( which probably led to my love for the Arts).In high school I restricted heavily. I called this portion control.In highscool I achieved significant weightloss.
I gained confidence: Lead in musicals, marching band, choir, class president, homecoming King.
I also started a punk rock band.Since graduating HS I've decided to pursue music as opposed to going to college, this, against the will/approval of my parents, teachers, and some peers.Anxiety and depression hit hard.
A lot of parties.
A lot of jobs in customer service
Prescribed medication for anxiety
Multiple antidepressants off and on
Abused other medications to help me escape my anxiety and feel ok with my reality, it gave me confidence, diminished my self doubt.     This was my drug.In and out of rehab for 4 yrs.
I don't take well to advice.
I had to do it myself.
Practically locked myself in a room.
I've been away from, ""clean"", off opiates ( the drug I can't control) for around 3 years now.Gained a lot of weight back after sobriety.
This scared me sh**less
Confidence now completely gone
Anxiety in full gearSometimes I'd manically 'exercise' (walk miles until my feet hurt). I didn't see results.
I started a new diet.
Eventually this diet mixed with poverty has lead me to a new weight. I'm fine with this number.
But not with the mirror.I obsess over my hair, have since puberty
I think my legs are fat, unproportional
Stomach rounded and pronounced
I sometimes I think im generally unattractive, the lines under my eyes, the way my mouth slopes downwards.
Times when I've changed my outfit 6 or 7 times before performing a show (still a musican, folk music now)
Times I've changed my outfit 6 or 7 times before going to the grocery store, to work, to the bar, to my parents house, to the park.I feel I'm never satisfied with the way that I look and this huge lack of confidence has and is TAKING A TOLL on my everyday life.

Both pretty young, male, achieving personal successes, and letting crap thoughts about our body take up more real estate in our minds than necessary. Honestly, I don't have a cure-all solution for any of this, but I know what helps me when I'm feeling particularly down about myself is reminding myself that I am so much more than just my body. I am a unique body, with a unique skill set, that in0turn helps make other people feel good which ultimately is what makes me feel amazing. I am a photographer, writer, and graphic designer, and what I've been focusing on in the past few years is learning to let my art and my craft fulfill me more than a sideways long glance into a mirror would. You have a creative gift man––one that many would be jealous of. You get to perform live. You know how hard that sh*t is for some people? Your friends and fans surely aren't buying tickets to watch a body step out on stage and listen it hold a pitch. They want YOU, the soulful and creative YOU that lives inside your body that tiptoes out during each performance and touches the heart of everyone in the audience in a different way. You are the deliverer of so much inner peace to so many people and you shouldn't be left out from that!
There isn't a single solution to overcoming the low self-esteem you've been feeling recently, in my opinion. Good Self esteem that takes practice, time, and a drop-dead honest group of friends. (Im not a doctor, just to be clear, and the advice that I'm about to offer is what has helped me in the past and present and might not work with you!) What helps me is creating small habits that help me feel my best. I try and exercise most days of the week, not with the intention of altering my body, but to feel the good rush of endorphins that comes along with it. I too feel that I have bigger than average legs, and this might have been because I rowed in college, but I don't let that thought discourage me from taking care of my health. I also really enjoy making random gifts for people, which helps me flash some of my creativity (self esteem +) and helps someone else feel thought-of and loved in return.
I turn back to this question when I hear the internal chatter get pretty dark: What would my response be to a close friend if they expressed such thoughts about their body/themselves out loud to me? I have been trying to treat myself as someone that I've loved, to grant myself grace for any supposed shortcomings that I have (or that I have believed to have been said about me at a point in time) and to uphold all the beautiful things I've created and to continue pushing forward towards the things yet to come with gratitude and a healthy dose of pride.

I really feel for you.  My son is now 15 and is an amazingly passionate, perfectionist who has always thought his torso was too fat and has struggled with this. He now has orthorexi and exercises for specific body image and is focused so much on this.  Of course everyone comments on how great he looks but inside he is miserable.  His whole life revolves around this.  People don't think he has a problem because he gets straight As and is the most fit guy in his class.  He is empathetic and sensitive but feels alone and anxious and no one would guess.  He changes his clothes constantly, and now that he is thin and muscular (but way way too thin) he still will only wear certain clothes, including coats, so I know what you are talking about.He is extremely attractive, but doesn't even see this.

4,12/08/2019,Letthehealingbegin,eternal88,"Good day and Blessings to all. I have been dealing with emotional bingeing and purging. I used to beat myself up mentally with shame and regret. Now I am educating myself on the seriousness of this unhealthy coping cycle. I ceased my bingeing and purging episodes for a year or so until recently. As my grandmothers dementia worsen, family cohesion crashing, anxiety increases, and for some reason I have the worst negative thinking that does not seem to come from my heart but it's very judgemental. I start to feel drained mentally and even physically at times. B/P does not make it better as a way of coping. It will only deteriorate the mind body and soul. I understand that i have to fix the root of this cycle to heal completely. Pain is okay. Suppression is not. Understand that there are deeper consequences than emotional regret. The physical damage can be life threatening. My body needs me to get a grip and extract this demon. My mind needs me to free it from chains of regret. My soul needs me to nourish it with peace. I need me to Love My Existence more. We all do. Now let your healing begin",iwanttolive,"Wed,01/15/2020-10:48pm","Hi.  I am sorry to hear of your grandmother's dementia.

5,01/15/2020,todded,iwanttolive,"Hello.  I am sorry you have been struggling for so long.  One thing is that we are not allowed to give out specific treatment center information.  But, we can offer support and help.  If I may, I was wondering why you have not let your wife know of how much you are struggling.  Do you think she suspects something, because even though I am not married, I would think that living with someone who is that close to you probably knows something isn't right and is afraid to bring it up or is waiting for you?  Do you think she is worried about you?  Does it affect your relationship do you think to have this kept from her?  I know these seem like very intrusive questions from a complete stranger. I struggled with eating disorders for most of my life. I am now getting a lot of relief although I still have some struggles.  I found it very difficult to hide from my parents.  Could never do it, they always somehow knew.  Still know when I am struggling even if I don't tell them.If you are planning on going into long term treatment or a day program she will probably have to be told.  How would you feel about her knowing at that point?  Are you feeling shame for struggling?  Because this is not something you dreamt up and said, I want to have an eating disorder.  No. Life events caused you to turn to behaviors because that is what addictions do.  They serve a purpose and that is often to relieve internal pain that has never been dealt with.  Have you ever seen a therapist for this?  NEDA can help you locate treatment providers in your area.  If you really think you need to go inpatient, they can help you find a place as well.  You may want to call different places to see the ratio of men to women and the average age.  It may be helpful information.  Also to know what type of therapy is used:  DBT  or CBT are the two most common.  Knowing how long they give you to finish your meals, if they allow you to select your meals or if they serve you.  Some places go on exchanges and allow you to menu plan, others just serve you and you eat what they serve.  But I am getting ahead of myself.  You first have to decide if you are going to therapy, or if you want to go into the hospital and then start therapy after.  I think if you go to your medical doctor and get checked out medically.  Let your doctor know what is going on.  If you are going to get help  you will probably need to start letting some people know, such as your medical doctor.  It may be scary or embarrassing, but we all struggle with something and shame should not factor into your getting help.  Eating disorders are life threatening and if you think it is out of control I urge you to seek some sort of help.The type of insurance you have will also have an impact on what type of program you may be able to go to.   I know I just threw a lot of information at you.  Hope it wasn't too overwhelming.  I also hope it helped some.  You may never get to this point because you were upset by my initial questions, but I asked them because I have been dealing with the eating disorder a long time and understand family dynamics a lot.  I wasn't trying to be too personal.  You don't even have to answer them on the forum.  They are for you to think about.  So, if you want to, let us know how you are doing.  I'd like to here how you are.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,01/15/2020,Whitematt881,iwanttolive,"Hello there. First off, I am not a male, sorry.  But I have struggled with eating disorders for a long time.  I am now mostly in recovery.  You are correct in saying much more needs to be done to help males and seniors with eating disorders.  I know someone who is a senior who starting using alcohol to cope and another person said well, older people don't become alcoholics.  I was like...what?  Don't you know how high the rate of alcoholism is in the senior population.  I say that to let you know that people just don't realize that any age, any color, any gender, any economic back round or race do struggle with the same things.  Things like mental illness or eating disorders for staying on topic do not discriminate.  For so long, there were only females in treatment facilities.  For the most part this is still true today.  I am 52.  For a very long time as the eating disorder continued to rule my life, I was one of the oldest person in the program.  I felt terrible that I was such a bad influence for all the youngsters there that it was not good for me.  They really needed to separate the thirteen year old's from the adults as we have different life experiences and issues. For you not being able to find care in a mostly segregated society when it comes to the treatment of eating disorders, I am sorry.  Segregated in terms of programs not having specific help for men, and for older adults who usually start off young and never finding recovery, or having the eating disorder start late in life when life got really difficult.  My hope for you is that things will change quicker than they are.  More awareness is occurring but not quick enough for those as you need help now.  Please feel free to post on the working toward recovery and maintaining recovery.  You may find more support there, even if it isn't always a man giving you the support. I don't know how you feel about that.  My warmest wishes to you and please, keep posting and reaching out for support.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9,11/03/2019,HowdoIcope?,Westy96,"So I'm a 23 year old male coming to terms with the fact I've had an eating disorder for several years now. I basically have an addiction to sweet things and crave them. These cravings have nothing to do with hunger. I really struggle to acknowledge it as a problem, so I ultimately fail to actually put anything in place to address my issues. This is my main issue. It doesn't help either that I can't really achieve a proper balance. I'm a very 'all or nothing' person in general. I've tried keeping a food diary in the past, but never really took it seriously. I also often forgot to include everything I had eaten. Instead of writing in it as soon as I had eaten, I would fill it in during the evening, but some days I forgot to even fill it in at all. When I did my food diary, seeing it all written down did help to hit home just how quickly a little here and there mounts up.I sometimes feel as if I am having a good day and can afford to be less careful, but I struggle to acknowledge when I have a bad day, or admit it to others. It negatively impacts those around me and comes across as if I do not care, or that I am selfish and arrogant. That is not my intent at all, but I can offer no explanation why I do it, nor can I justify it. I know it's wrong, but I can't help myself. My current action plan is to seek the advice of like minded individuals and hopefully offer my own when I find myself in a better place. This is why I've now signed up to this site. I am also starting a new food diary. I intend to fill it in when I eat, or to make a note on my phone if I am unable to do so. I also plan to fill it in honestly and in detail. Hopefully, this will help break me out of the mindset of being less careful than I need to. Lastly, I hope that if I do have a bad day, I will be able to talk to those I live with about it. To just acknowledge it before I have eaten most of the sweet things in the house. I know I need to change my mindset and the first step is to acknowledge this IS a major issue. And the way I am, I will likely need to keep a food diary for the foreseeable future to help keep on the right track. I'm also hoping that reading through other's posts and responses will help me to improve my own issues and get me to a place where I can also maybe help others.",a.thompson120,"Fri,11/15/2019-10:37pm","Hi Westy96,I'm glad you awknowlegded your problem, found this forum, and decided to do a few things to help it.
I would highly suggest therapy, online or in person. Eating disorders are not something you deserve to deal with alone. The people you live with, your friends, and family can only help to the best of their knowledge but you might want to consider letting many of them know.
It sounds like the you and the people you live with share food, so it may be beneficial for you to ask them to grocery shop for you. That way, you won't buy sugary food on impulse and there may be less sugar in your house.
Speaking of less sugar, cooking is a good habit because it's healthy, and (from my experience) you feel proud of what you made and tend to eat more reasonably.I hope your food diary is going well and that your mindset is getting better. However, remember recovery has many relapses, and does not follow a straight line of improvement. I believe in you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,10/16/2019,Howdoyoucope?,Pineapple-Boy,I've been struggling with my relationship with food for a long time. I knew my eating habits weren't normal for a while and have caused me significantly more distress as time goes on. I switch between restricting and over exercising to bingeing. Food is on my mind 24/7. I've been like this for years. I didn't think I had a serious problem until the past week or so. I was watching a show and one of the characters ate/didn't eat like I would. The reaction from a character that saw this gave me a wake up call. I want to get better. I told a friend a little about it but they don't understand and change the subject quickly. My family wouldn't believe me or take me seriously. I don't have access to therapy or support groups right now. Is anyone in a similar situation?

I was careful of what I ate but slowly I would started developing bulimia it wasn’t excessive I would occasionally do it when I overate. I went through periods where I did it a lot then stopping.7 weeks ago I decided I needed to lose weight after noticing I had gained X pounds after not monitoring or calorie counting. I was so upset I wanted to give up my unhealthy purging habit but felt so inadequate and punished by own body, when I realised I gained that much weight in such a short time. It basically justified my reasons to purge.6 days ago I noticed I lost weight in 7 weeks, I went into panic mode and decided to start eating again. Since then I’ve gained  X kg  I’m close to the weight I want to be At I want stay at a certain weight. I’m just having anxiety with such rapid weight gain in such a short space of time. I know I sound pretentious and shallow but I don’t want to go past a certain level of weight, i feel confident and happy when I see myself in the mirror plus it’s a healthy BMI range. I never intended to be skinny I just wanted to maintain the weight I got down to after my weight loss journey. I want to stay at X pounds.I’m currently eating X calories a day for a week and I’m happy to regain as I know it’s good for my body and it’s rebuilding. But with just rapid weight gain am coming close to my goal weight. I want to give up my eating disorder and I will but I’m worried once I reach this how do I maintain and look ahead to the future.

But during that week the first few days I was excessive I was roughly consuming X amount (I’m still guilty of over calculating now) but it was definitely inbetween that number. I’m just lost I don’t know what I’m doing and the uncertainty of the method I’m using to refeed is further driving me into panic. For the past 3 days however I’ve noticed my excessive hunger has decreased am consuming a regular caloric intake. I’m I still at risk of refeeding syndrome considering it’s been 2 weeks of eating again? Forgot to mention I finally told my therapist that I have an ED that I’ve been using symptoms for over a year ( when I’m restrictive I don’t do this)  and my fear of becoming fat again, but I failed to mention that I was underweight as well as the physical symptoms I was experiencing.

I'm sure if you contact some sort of dietitian also, you could ask them how you can safely give up the ED and how to do so without gaining too much back at once. My personal advice would be progressive re-emersion into eating. (Like, starting off with smaller amounts of food and moving onto regular portions so your body has time to get used to the food) I hope that makes sense :/ However, I'm no professional, so don't take my advice to seriously.

13,08/07/2019,Recovering,imgoingtorecover,"I was just wondering if anyone is recovering on their own. For me i find that when i allow myself to take as much time as i need to do certain things my stomach is more receptive to food. The only problem is that this proccess is both healing but also agonizing. It would take me forever to get up in the morning, for example. I guess the best way to explain it is like a walking meditation, or eating meditation and kind of feels more like a relaxed lethargy. This is where it would take a long time to do a certain task. It's very affective and healing because i become very conscious of my body, but i end up falling back because it can be so daunting and i just quit and stop eating all together. I haven't fully completed like a week or couple days of it even though i know this is the best way for me to recover. I've been dealing with my ED (alone) for so many years. I've tried many different ways to recover and i would just love for it to be over. I am not that good at explaining it but I was just wondering if anyone was going though the same proccess. Also, this place has been so helpful. They really get it. I called for the first time yesterday and i appreciated it so much. It inspired me to write this which I've never thought id do.

14,07/18/2019,OptionsinPAforBDDandED,JMC41996,"My earliest accounts of suffering are at the age of 14. I am now 23. When I was 19 I received a diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder. Just a few months ago I was diagnosed with an eating disorder. It is hard for me to write here because my perception of myself has made certain aspects of my life much more difficult. The best way to explain my situation now, is to touch base on the past few years. I became extremely self conscious at 14 after I developed cystic acne. I mean, it was just unusual. It led me to skip school, not look people in the eye, and just socially withdraw from almost everyone except my family and girlfriend who acted as both a lover and best friend. The times I was in school, my ""friends"" would say out of shock ""OMG did you get into a fight""... or times at fast food restaurants there was a sudden conversation about how greasy foods affect your skin; probably started by looking at me then ended with suggestions on what I could do to improve my skin. Well, thankfully my mom took me to a dermatologist. From that first appointment until now the remedy has been the perscriptions they provided me. Its important to note that since I was 17 my acne has been under control, which I am beyond thankful for. My self consciousness was not just limited to my skin. I also despised my nose. I mean despised. I remember getting into countless fights with my parents and girlfriend over financing for it. Told my therapist how uncomfortable it made me and swore that I would eventually have plastic surgery to fix it. Well, that still hasn't happened. My senior year (aged 17-18) I ended the relationship with my girlfriend after 3.5 years together. I cared about her deeply but felt that I was indeed attracted to the opposite sex. So, I came out. It was relieving and I could not have asked for a more supportive network. However, upon coming out... it left a lot of questions for me to answer from others. ""Are you the 'woman' or 'man'"", ""You do not LOOK gay"", ""You are a failure at being gay"". These questions in association with ""suggestions"" on how to improve on being ""gay"" just really hurt me. I know that being gay, liking the same sex, has absolutely nothing to do with the way you look or behave but there is infact this stereotype I struggled to deal with. I had a lot of remarks about my hair. I was shaving it but after suggestions on to grow it out, I tried. I mean tried. After a lot of research I ended up going back to my dermo. with the complaint and she gave me some perscriptions. I truly want to say, it has in fact done WONDERS.i While yes, my hair condition was being handled. I still was receiving this ongoing feedback regularly on how to improve my appearance (even writing this I just cannot understand why their was so much emphasis on my physical appearance in relation to my sexuality but their in fact was). I remember hearing from multiple people that I was a ""failure at being gay"" because I did not look a certain way, like certain things, etc.. Underlying all of this was this ongoing preoccupation with my appearance apparently people did not perceive I was concerned about; when I actually was. In January 2017 I started to go to the gym. Where I currently am, I work at a gym. My peak was Sept-December 2018. I had lost over X pounds however gained a lot of lean muscle. Truth was I was exercising all the time plus restricting my calorie intake. At my lowest I was Xlbs 5'4"". Around November 2018 I knew the holidays were here and I wanted to eat. I honestly forget where I saw it but that was when I started taking laxatives. It's so embarrassing. After overeating, I fast. This is still going on and I do it out of pain. I feel like I am just so ashamed of my physical appearance. I am always hungry. Probably because of how much a train + the emotional turmoil of it all. I went to my doctor a few months ago, told her my concerns. She knows I have been struggling (in 2016 I was diagnosed with BDD after an involuntary hospitalization). She diagnosed me with an eating disorder and referred me to a nutritionist. They both felt like I need impatient but it was in the middle of my semester. I still struggle everyday with food, binge eating, fasting or using laxatives. All for a compliment... I need help but I am so concerned with this derailing my graduation in May. I also cannot afford to take off work. Please, what resources are available for me?",_admin_moderator,"Fri,07/19/2019-1:54pm","Hi, JMC41996. Thank you for posting.

I just want to ay that I hear you.  But having incisiveness over recovery, wanting to recover and then fearing it is normal.  Eating disorders serve a purpose most of the time.  For me, I was so afraid of people, of being hurt, of just living a regular life, I thought it was easier to just live sick, in hospitals and programs and avoid life.  Well, I eventually had to face life, face my fears.  So for you, figuring out what purpose the eating disorder is serving is essential to overcoming it and this us usually done with the help of a therapist.  So many people suffering with an eating disorder discount the validity based on a number.  Unfortunately insurance companies use numbers but there is something called eating disorder otherwise unspecified.   I think.  It means that you may have anorexia, based on your fears of food, thought patterns and behaviors but since you started losing weight at a higher weight your weight loss doesn't put you in the underweight category.  You may face all the other symptoms that comes along with anorexia.  Atypical anorexia I think is another way to identify it.  But ultimately a term will never identify your exact experience, pain, struggles, fears, whatever you may be feeling.  So try not to get hung up on that so much.  See if you can get help for the underlying cause of the eating disordered behaviors and know you are not the eating disorder.  You are separate from it and it does not define you. You are so much more than any diagnosis.  See if you can get help for the pain it is causing you.  Take care,iwanttolive and I am",,,,,,,,,
16,09/08/2018,DesiretoRelapse,Oliver278,"I have been living essentially ED-free for years. I considered it a somewhat embarrassing, but otherwise inconsequential part of my past. I'm 23 now, and I was 16-18 back then; I felt like I'd learned and grown and anyway, I didn't *really* have anorexia because I didn't lose enough weight, so it really didn't matter. Then, my doctor told me I'm slightly pre-diabetic, and that I need to lose some weight. I'm aware that I'm overweight these days. Maybe as a result of being on so many SSRI meds, maybe as a result of a somewhat sedentary lifestyle, maybe as a result of not really paying attention to what I eat. Who knows. So I changed my meds with my psychiatrist, downloaded My Fitness Pal, and decided I would eat a certain number of calories a day. Only, I started noticing some troubling things. I would feel pride and happiness when I ate less than I allotted myself. I would feel intense guilt about eating ""bad"" foods, even if my calorie count was fine. And perhaps the most troubling thing, I didn't care at all if I'd skipped a meal or two for whatever reason, and ate less than I should have. I talked with my therapist, and she told me to delete the app and stop counting calories. I talked with my girlfriend, and now she praises me for ""letting myself"" have unhealthy, which annoys me to no end. I just want to be skinny again.

18,10/20/2018,Orthorexia/Anxiety/Lowselfconfidence/,Ansgani,"Hello,I'm a french 27 man and I suffer of eating disorder since i'm 15 16 approximately. At that age I
 started to question my nutrition after hearing french governemental dietary advices encouraging people to eat less fat, sugar and salt, more fruits, vegetables, ... (you know the script)
I think it's important for you to know that two years before that, I lost my grand mother because of an arterial disease that cause her corpse to malfunction progressively to a point where her life was a nightmare. (her organs weren't sufficiently vascularize so she coundn't eat normally and died in few months)Since that age, i became hypochondriac and it was therefore logical for me to have a total control over my diet and my physical activities to remain in good health. But after many years of training in differents endurance sports and of ""good eating"", I realized that first I'm not happy, second my need to control every aspect of my life is a great source of stress and social isolation and third I don't even know even today at 27 WHAT A GOOD DIET IS. I mean there are so many differents people with so many differents nutrition guidelines to fellow (which are furthermore sometimes contradictory) that it becomes totally impossible to known how to eat well without any doubts. (paleo, vegan, vegetarian, ....)(and i don't even talk about the qualitative aspect of food with all the chemicals they are putting in our food nowadays)So, can you help me to get ride of those doubts that are ruining my life since more than 10 years now in way to at last live a normal and fulfilling life ?Thanks a lot for your help.",BobJ48,"Mon,10/29/2018-5:53pm","Hey there Ansgani,Sorry that your note sat for a while with no response.  I've been trying to get things ready for winter here, before the weather gets bad, and have not been on the computer as much as I normally am. And yes, people can become trapped by things like this alright. While it may seem reasonable to want to protect ourselves by eating right, after a while the whole thing can get obsessive, and suddenly we are not in control at all.  As you said, the stress and anxiety, and the other ways that it begins to effect a person's life can become more and more constraining with time.So yes, how does a person become more flexible. and less under the spell of things like this ?For one thing, as I suspect you are seeing, there really is no one ""perfect diet"".   People have all sorts of different ideas about what's best.   And then there are all those people who eat pretty much whatever they want, and yet somehow they remain alive and healthy.   So it seems reasonable to think that people can indeed be flexible with their intake and still be OK.But yes, there's the food part, and then there's the anxiety and obsessiveness part.  This is just me, of course, but  I think a person needs to look at both of those things.   Simply changing your eating habits is unlikely to address the issue in the way that you would like.  The psychological parts (which are what are at the heart of the matter) will need to be addressed too.   Which may mean getting some psychological counseling, as well some diet advice. Hopefully you'll be able to break free of these obsessions, and will discover a freer and more open life.  As you said, no one like's to find themselves and their lives controlled by things like this. Keep writing ?Bob J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,10/23/2018,MarathonTraining,mprunner,"I'm a lifelong runner and distance running has been my sole passion and outlet for as long as I can remember. I'm in the midst of training for my third marathon next month and this phase of training is always hard for me to not view food as a reward/punishment. I know I have disordered thinking about food (particularly with exercise), but what are some tips you guys might have for not believing lies that I don't deserve food or need to earn it?
