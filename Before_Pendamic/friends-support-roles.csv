0,01/30/2020,Concernedaboutafriend,treefrog2020,"My very close friend has been struggling with a few things in her life and has gone through a lot more than a 19 year old girl should ever have to go through. This year she took a second gap year before going to university, planned to travel yet seems to have let all those travel dreams fade and has no interest in it any more. She is not happy with her job and isolates herself. I try and make plans with her and she will either say that she will do x with me such as go for drinks, go for a walk, just chill and hangout but then she will cancel last minute or she will not respond to me until it is too late to do anything. Other times she wont answer me, and she never seems to reach out to me anymore to make plans. It worries me because she is isolating herself completely from friends, she did tell me she was taking time but I don't think that it is healthy to isolate yourslef for months. I understand she wants time for herself and I am not mad that she won't spend time with me, I am just concerned. She works out a lot too, and besides going to the gym and work she doesnt leave her house really unless she is running errands. Her younger sister reached out to me on because she is worried for her sister/my friend as she has notices she is very mad all the time, asks her/her dad for money weekly (avg $50), she hides out in her room in the basement, and jsut doesnt seem herself. And then the sister sent me a video of all the garbage from foods which she has hid in her cold cellar downstairs. Her sister says she sneaks the food in through the side door, and has heard her throwing up a few times, but she is also not home all the time because she is in school and at extra curriculars. Her sister says she will eat a bunch of these foods and then hide it in bags and throw it up. She has been vegan for quite some time, partialy for dietary purposes, so a lot of the food she has hidden is not vegan. She also doesnt eat when at work, which is from 9-5 (I worked with her this summer so I just noticed it). I saw her today as I ran into her at the grocery store and in her basket (I didnt observe too much because i didnt want to make her feel any more uncomfortable) but she had ice cream cones and chip bags, and more under that I didnt get a look at. I could tell she felt super uncomfortable and she hid the basket, so i kept it short and left. I just dont know what to do because I dont know for sure that she has an eating disorder, but i am really concerned as she is not acting like herslef and is shutting people out. When I saw her I noticed she has broken out in acne on her face and her face is quite puffy. I want to support her so badly because we are so close and I also miss spending time with her. I just don't know how to go about any of this in a way that won't upset her, or she lose trust in me.",BobJ48,"Fri,02/14/2020-4:33pm","I'm so sorry to hear about your friend !   But really, if you are on sites for people with eating disorders, you'll often hear them complain about everything that you've mentioned.  How they've lost all their friends, how they isolate themselves and never get out of the house, and how they've lost interest in all of the things that once interested them in the past.So I can tell you with some assurance that it's quite likely that your friend isn't any happier about this than you are.  And that she's probably not oblivious to the effects that it's having on her either.So really, it's like they have fallen under the power of an evil spell.  One that tells them that if only they can exert enough self-control, and lose those next few pounds, then somehow things will be wonderful for them…at some undisclosed time in the future.   Which…they can sort of believe in the beginning, but I suspect that your friend is past that stage now.  Which is what usually happens sooner or later.  Rather than it being an exercise in self-control that they can gladly congratulate themselves for, it turns into an inescapable nightmare instead.  Depression and despair can then start setting in, and as you've seen, an urge to isolate themselves too.To be honest, your efforts to help her re-engage with the world, and in normal daily activities are good ones I think.   Go for a walk, go to a play, go out and do anything really.   As you've seen, she's likely to make excuses, but I think it's OK to tell her that you won't take no for an answer.  You may want to let her know that you won't push the eating thing as a part of the activity, but you could go and drink coffee or something, and she'd probably be OK with that.Of course we aren't doctors or therapists, but we are qualified to be friends I think, and getting her out and doing the sorts of things that friends do together is a useful and proper role I believe.She'll have to be OK with allowing these things to happen of course, but you never know : If she does get out with you, you may find her thanking you and admitting that she had a good time.",Connec,"Sat,02/22/2020-8:28am","My friend who is in her 60’s has been restricting eating for years. I met her in a yoga class about eight years ago and did not observe/connect until spring 2019 when I learned she was in hospital. (when I became her health care proxy). Divorced and long-estranged from only family, a brother who lives thousands of miles away, has been isolating for years (apart from this particular yoga class which no longer exists). She does not admit to an eating disorder while in last 6 months her weight has dropped significantly. Won’t consent to in-patient (or out-patient) program. What is available in this upstate NY area is not great anyway.  She has some cognitive issues and may be slipping towards dementia.
Her primary doctor of many years and the eating disorders physician at local hospital don’t seem to have a plan, but just encourage her to gain weight.

Thanks.",BobJ48,"Tue,02/25/2020-2:44pm","This sounds like a difficult matter alright.  While you friend clearly has an issue, if she refuses to see it as a problem, I don't think there is much that anyone can do to make her gain weight voluntarily.  If she had some sort of clear medical issue that was weight related which threatened her life, perhaps she could be hospitalized for that.  But that she is simply thin apparently by choice, and getting thinner;  I'm not sure that the medical community would hospitalize someone against their will for a matter like that. However, you did mention that she was isolating herself, and if you are friends enough with her to actually want to spend time with her, you could play a positive role as far as helping her stay connected to the outside world is concerned.  Just by spending time with her, and perhaps the two of you doing some activities that keep her engaged in some of the more stimulating aspects of normal life.Eating disorders among older individuals is more common that most people realize, so what you are seeing in her is probably less out of the ordinary than it may seem.",,,,,,,,,,,,

2,02/15/2020,advice,starlover_13,"Hi,My best friend recently got diagnosed with anorexia nervosa around a month ago. Even though I had seen some of her restricting behaviors towards food, I felt guilty as her best friend for not noticing sooner. I struggle with another form of mental illness and some disordered eating, so, I feel ignorant for not always checking in when it came to food or realizing that she wasn't doing okay in any aspect of her life.",BobJ48,"Tue,02/18/2020-12:21am","Yeah, we can feel bad that somehow we didn't notice.  Particularly when it's a friend.   But EDs can be pretty secretive things, and sometimes even the person who has them is not willing to admit to themselves that they have a problem. But I'm not sure that checking her food intake would have helped much to be honest. I mean maybe she would have told you that she was restricting, or maybe she would have said there's no problem.  Often people don't want us to worry, you know ?But you are right ; perhaps there was something going on in her life that brought this on in the first place.  And who knows, perhaps there's something that's still going on.  Some kind of stressful situation that causes her to not feel in control of her life ?  Worries about control can often bring things like this on, but such concerns can sometimes be private too. Are you guys able to talk about any of this ?  Does it seem like she is interested in recovering ?The main thing will be to stay friends I think. Even if that means that you don't talk a lot about this.   Just being able to help keep your friend engaged in normal sorts of daily things, you know ?   So you can help her not to start withdrawing from the world, which is something that can happen in situations like this.   And that's not a good development for them.Whatever the case, your friend if fortunate to have a caring friend like yourself.  Things like that can really matter.  xx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,12/22/2019,Encouragingfriendtogethelp,Kat.y,"I’m the only one who knows my friend is having issues with an eating disorder (restricting herself to extremely limited calories and purging).  I am trying to get her to go see a professional, but she is understandably scared to take the first step and won’t move forward. She says that she feels like it’s getting worse and I’m just worried that she is going to get to an unhealthy weight and begin getting bad side effects. Again, I’m the only one who knows about her struggles and she doesn’t feel like she can talk to anyone else about them. I know this isn’t about me, but I’m freaking out. It’s the number one thing on my mind everyday, and I just don’t know what to do. If anyone has any advice of how I can support her, I would be so grateful. I know I can’t fix her but I want to make sure I’m doing the most I can.  I’m really worried about her health and I just don’t know what else to do.  Thank you so much.",iwanttolive,"Wed,12/25/2019-12:27am","Hi.  I am sorry to hear about your friend, but am thankful for your concern.  I would first of all suggest that you contact NEDA and ask them for help and support.  They would be able to help you figure out what to do to help your friend.  I know when I was in school, my friend told my therapist about something life threatening that I did.  I was not angry with her and when she told me she told my therapist we both went together to talk with her and I did wind up going to a hospital.If you are this concerned about your friend, is it possible to tell her how concerned you are? Do you know her parents?  Are they involved in her life?  Being that I don't know you and we are really not allowed to offer advice, but share experiences and offer support, I will do that.  I also want to make sure you are okay and that you don't feel responsible for your friends choices.  It is difficult I know, but she needs professional help.  Maybe the two of you can contact NEDA together and get help and or referrals for a therapist for your friend.  That way you aren't going behind her back and at the same time can get help for yourself.  On the web site for NEDA there are tool kits for family and friends to help you know what to do and or say.  That might be helpful for you.  It is a difficult place to be when you care about someone a lot as you do, but to not get in over your head.  You can not stop your friend from using any type of behavior but you can be there to support her.  Again, I am concerned for you as she is responsible for herself and you are responsible for you.  That may seem harsh but if you take on her responsibility you are going to not be able to help your friend.  It is similar to when someone is drowning.  The friend wants to help the person drowning, so they go out to rescue the person who is drowning, but what happens is the person drowning brings down the rescuer and both wind up drowning.  If the other person is equipped and knows how to save someone, then a rescue can take place.
This may sound terrible, but it is true.  In order to help your friend, you need to be in a place where you are equipped.  Calling NEDA may help you with that and they can further assist you in what to do next.
I am sorry I was unable to offer anything better than this.  Eating disorders are life threatening and serious.  If your friend is as bad off as you are saying, please let someone know who can help her get help.  Thank you for caring about your friend.  I do not say all of this to discourage you but to say that while it is good that you are supporting your friend, she may need more than what you can give her.
Please, let us know how the both of you are doing.  You are both important.  I say all I did with care and concern, not to frighten you away.  iwanttolive",Kat.y,"Thu,12/26/2019-6:42pm","thank you SO MUCH for your incredibly thoughtful response. this is way more than i ever expected!
First of all, I really really appreciate that you're looking out for me. Everything you said makes total sense. I am working on trying to take better care of myself through all of this. I am planning on talking to my own therapist next week.
As for my friend, she keeps emphasizing that she is very scared to tell someone, because she's worried about what people will think, but also is nervous to give all of this up.  Her relationship with her parents is not in a place where she feels like she can talk to them about it. I feel like my biggest role is to help her get help and just be there, I just want to make sure I'm doing the most I can.
I wish I could give more specifics, but the last thing I want to do is have my friend's identity be traceable in anyway. But if it helps, we are both in college.
Again, I am SO grateful that you took time out of your day to respond. You are a saint. I hope you had a wonderful holiday season, and I hope for an amazing 2020 for you, you deserve it!",iwanttolive,"Fri,12/27/2019-10:11pm","Hi! I am glad you found my post helpful and I enjoy being able to help others navigate this illness as best I can.  You said you are both in college.  Most college campuses have counseling departments and many have therapists who understand eating disorders.  Some may even have a support group available free of charge.   Maybe if you haven't you can look into this.I am glad to hear you are looking out for yourself.  As far as your friend not wanting to worry or bother or being worried about what other people may think, if she is using behaviors others may know even if they aren't saying anything.  They may not.  I don't know.  Disclosure is always a very personal and difficult decision and one of the things NEDA is trying to do is help remove the stigma that comes with having an eating disorder and others in the mental health field are working on destigmatizing any and all forms of mental illness.  It is a big job and a lot of work still needs to be done in this area.  Many people do not understand eating disorders or depression and the others, and say, just eat, or just stop after on slice, or snap out of it....and ignorance is not bliss to those affected by it and the family members that don't understand and blame the sufferer.  So it is so difficult.I am very glad your friend has you to support her.  I hope the holidays weren't to difficult as they tend to be for many with mental health issues.  I hope you were okay as well. Please feel free to post anytime even to say how you are coping and dealing with helping your friend.
Take care.iwanttolive",Kat.y,"Fri,01/31/2020-5:23pm","Hello again!
I just wanted to update/maybe get some more advice if possible. My friend is still suffering a lot and doesn’t want to go to counseling because her family doesn’t believe in it. I totally get that, but I really think she needs professional help so I’m really not sure what to do. What is the best way of approaching this?
On the other hand, I’m still the only one who knows and I’m really really struggling in carrying all of this all by myself. I want to be there for my friend and the last thing I want is for her to feel like I can’t be there for her. (I haven’t expressed to her how hard it is for me) It’s just been a lot for me to carry on my own and I don’t really know what to do about that. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to handle all of this?? My friend’s well being is my top priority, because I know that she I suffering a lot more than I am, but I’m just struggling a lot.
Thank you so much!!",iwanttolive,"Fri,01/31/2020-10:32pm","Hi Kat.y.   I am sorry to hear that your friend is still not doing well. I haven't been posting but check in to see how people are doing, but I feel it is important that I respond to your post. Something you said concerns me, "" my highest priority is my friends well being as she is suffering a lot more than me"" or close to that. I understand your heart. But you can not save your friend. Take the drowning swimmer analogy.  You need to be strong and the other person has to have gotten to the point where they are no longer fighting and resisting help or both of you will drown. It is the same situation here. You ARE AS IMPORTANT as your friend. YOU MATTER as much as your friend and it isn't helpful to quantify the degree of suffering. Each person's pain is real and equally important and deserving of being helped. You can not save your friend. She needs professional help.  Loving someone sometimes means being willing to risk losing their friendship by getting them help. It sounds to me like you are in over your head and you need help as well. Please call NEDA as they can help direct you and help advise you how to best help your friend and take care of yourself. I am dealing with a very sick sister and it is so difficult.  I want her to do things that I think would be good for her but I have learned I can not make her or anyone for that matter do anything.   I on a good day am doing what is best for me. This is not saying not to help others or to be self absorbed but to learn how to be healthy when someone we love is sick. I know I just said lot. I encourage you to go with your heart regarding your friend. I don't want you to live with regret if someone happens to her. You love her. I know. I hope you are able to let someone know she needs help.  Again,  the NEDA helpline can help you further. Take care of yourself. iwanttolive",Kat.y,"Fri,01/31/2020-11:08pm","Iwanttolive-

My best friend, who is also my roomie has been struggling with binge eating disorder for a very long time. For the time I’ve known her she has gone through up and down cycles. Sometimes she will go without binging for some time, but just when I think she is starting to recover and make progress she binges. Her binges have been getting consistently worse everytime recently to the point where she will eat until she passes out and it last for days. I have tried to help in many ways. I have been supportive, understanding and patient. I am getting frustrating though because she has stolen food from me multiple times. We have set boundaries, but she has broken them. I am torn apart and am not sure what to do because she is my best friend. I want to be supportive and understanding still but I am getting to a breaking point. Please help me, I have no idea what to do.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,01/13/2020-2:25am","Hi Itseemmmmaa - you mentioned some concerning symptoms in your post, and we wanted to affirm that this is a sign for which your friend may need to seek medical attention. The following are just some of the signs of a serious problem that demands immediate medical attention:

 Please do not hesitate to call the NEDA helpline at 1-800-931-2237 (Monday-Thursday 9:00am-9:00pm, Friday 9:00am-5:00pm EST) if you need help finding resources to help support your friend. Please take care.",iwanttolive,"Mon,01/13/2020-8:38pm","Hi.   I am sorry for your situation and for your friends struggle.  Is it possible to get help through the counselling services at your college?  Many campuses have counselling centers.  You may want to go for yourself first and then let your friend know about them.   Also, NEDA has a lot of information on their web site on how to help someone you love, be it a friend or family member.  You can also call them or chat with them online.  If your friend is indeed passed out, it may be very important to call 911 or the nurse on campus.  I wouldn't worry so much about if she will be mad at you if you are saving her life.  It appears that she needs help but is not aware of it or is afraid of it or doesn't want to get help.  But it isn't your job to jeep your friend from hurting herself in this way.  As difficult as this sounds, it is her responsibility, but you can get her help if she is in danger.  If her life is in danger.  If she is passed out.  Eating disorders are life threatening.  They are very serious and without help usually get worse.  Please take care of yourself and know you can not control what your friend does or doesn't do.  I know it is scary.

5,12/27/2019,Notsurewhattodoatthispoint,koifish22,"My friend has anorexia, and has been struggling for awhile. I recommended her to NEDA. She didn't even try. I asked her to look into a support group's website. She didn't visit it. She claims she's getting better, but I hear her every time she says ""I'm so fat.."" and I see her every time she refuses lunch. She won't go to a therapist. And..she seems to think I don't care because I don't talk to her about it. But in actuality, I care so deeply about her health (hence why I'm on this platform) and didn't want to do or say anything that could have the wrong effect. I'm sort of a perfectionist and don't wanna screw this up. I feel so helpless.
       Sincerely, Me
Any advice or suggestions are welcome",iwanttolive,"Fri,12/27/2019-10:27pm","Hi.  I am sorry for your friend's inability to get, receive or see that she needs help, or just is not able to cope with it.  There is a parent's tool kit that helps friends and family or parent's know how and or what to say to help a loved one dealing with an eating disorder.  And on Monday you can call or chat with a trained volunteer about your situation.  For now, sometimes saying anything can be taken the wrong way with someone who is struggling with an eating disorder.  So I think you are on the right track when you don't ""feed"" into your friends obsession.   You might want to say that you are concerned for her and will listen if you are able to at this point, but you won't comment on her weight or appearance as it won't help her.  It sounds as though you figured this out.   It is important that you take care of yourself and if you are feeling in over your head you may want to consider getting some help for yourself in dealing with this.  It is very difficult and scary and you shouldn't be the only one involved in helping your friend.  It is too much in my opinion for one person to shoulder the responsibility.  It is really your friends decision if she gets help or doesn't.  Sometimes people are too sick to realize they need help and that is when others need to get involved even when the other person doesn't want that.  Eating disorders are dangerous and life threatening so if you feel your friend is at that point, you may want to let someone know of your concerns.  Unfortunately if she is over eighteen, no one can force her against her will to get help.  That is the tragic thing.  Fear plays a big role in why people don't get help.  It is scary.  There is so much wrapped up in change.
As for you, please take care of yourself and if you need help, don't be afraid to ask for it.Post anytime you need to.

I would love to know what advice would be helpful for this situation. Thank you, kindly.",iwanttolive,"Tue,12/03/2019-5:19pm","Hello.  I think it is great your want to help your friend.  I am wondering if they know that you know that they have an eating disorder?  That would be helpful when trying to talk with them about it.  If so, maybe you can just share that you are concerned for them and want them to know that they can talk with you anytime if they want to.  It is important to not focus on food or behaviors so much but to offer a listening ear.
If they don't know that you know about the eating disorder, that may be a little more challenging.  Does your friend talk about feelings openly or are they secretive.  People who have an eating disorder may try to protect it as it acts as a safety net and makes talking about it difficult because that is a way of coping for them.  If you just let your friend know that you are concerned about them and if they want to talk you are there for them.  Mentioning specifics about potential eating disorders may put them on the defensive.  So, it is a little tricky to answer as I do not know much about the situation.  Either way, I would just let your friend know that you are available for them if they want to talk about anything.   Also NEDA has resources and may be able to help you better.  They are available until 9pm EST at 800 931 2237  or you can chat with someone online.I hope this was helpful and please let us know how things go.  Again, thank you for your concern for your friend and wanting to help.  That is a good friend.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,11/17/2019,"Collegeroommatemaybestruggling,shouldInotifyparents?",c0nc3rn3d,"I've been rooming with my best friend this first semester of college and I've noticed some behaviors that may be indicative of an eating disorder. I'm worried I may have provoked it. I'm also wondering if I should talk to her parents. I'll start with a back story.We've been close friends since seventh grade and while she never overindulged, she seemed to eat an adequate amount of calories while she was under her parents roof.  You can probably tell by this description that she's a picky eater, and that hasn't changed... now it just seems that she eats much less. I've heard a lot of ""I'm just not hungry""s and ""I'm tired of the food on campus."" But we have some of the highest ranking on campus dining in America. Even I, as a vegan, haven't gotten sick of the food because we have SO MANY OPTIONS. Which brings me to my next point...Even though I eat in abundance, my diet is restrictive by definition, and I'm hoping my choice to follow this lifestyle isn't causing her to change the way she eats. While I would love to see people stop eating animals, they need to replace it with healthy whole foods, not nothing. Could this be because when people ask me why I'm vegan, one of my answers is that the agricultural industry is bad for the environment? I want to give people an honest answer, and I think they deserve to know the truth, but if this could be causing her to struggle with what she eats I don't want that.We also have a suite mate who has struggled with eating disorders, and still lives with one. Even though she now eats a very balanced diet and gets a proper amount of calories everyday, she still talks a lot about the amount of calories in everything she eats, and occasionally over-exercises, which could be triggering to my roommate. I'm not sure. Either way, even she has expressed concerns to me about my roommate potentially having an ED.I make many efforts to encourage her to eat such as being intentional about going to meals with her (while this usually works, I like to do spiritual fasts and I also just have my own schedule sometimes, during these times that I don't ask her to get food with me she usually just won't get it at all). I don't want to completely jump to conclusions. She doesn't show many of the typical signs of an ED such as counting calories, excessive exercise, eating healthy, low cal foods, or body checking. The only thing I have noticed is that she simply doesn't eat enough food. She is a picky eater. She really could be telling the truth when she says she's sick of the food here. Which leads me to my final question...Should I bring up my concerns to her parents? We'll be going home for thanksgiving break this weekend and I'm wondering if I should let them know to be on the lookout for any changes in the way she eats compared to the way she ate before coming off to college. Will she continue her patterns of eating inadequately or eat enough now that she has a variety of comforting food at her exposure?I don't want to ruin our friendship over my possible overreacting, so I want to be very careful about who I tell and the way I tell it. While we're best friends, it can be hard for her to be vulnerable with me and I don't want to ruin the little bit of vulnerability and lose her trust in me because I told her parents or accused her of something that isn't as big of a deal as I built it up to be.Thank you in advance :)",_admin_moderator,"Mon,11/18/2019-10:15am","Dear c0nc3rn3d, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove mentions of specific food items, which could be tiggering to others and therefore are not allowed on the forums.

When people have issues, they can go a long time without anyone else ever noticing or getting suspicious.  So yes, the fact that you do find yourself noticing says something right there. Could your food habits be triggering your friend ?  It's possible.  Then again, pretty much anything involving food, eating, or other people's appearance can be triggering to them, so changing your own habits is not likely to make a difference. I can hear your concern about wanting to preserve the trust that the two of you share, and it's not a foolish thing to worry about.  At the same time, if there is a problem, it would be good if her parents knew.  If they would be open to knowing that is.  Which to be honest, some parents aren't.  So you may have to play it by ear ?Because as you said, EDs can be a sensitive matter, and working with friends who we worry about can be a sensitive matter as well. Even so, I think it's fair to trust in the good-will that you have towards your friend, and the friendship you've shared for all these years. Things like that can make a difference I think, even in difficult matters like these.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She lives in another province so I don’t seen her often but I can now tell that She’s been suffering for years and I didn’t even notice. She’s always gone threw great lengths to hid it... and hid it well. I feel like a terrible person for not noticing, like maybe I was to self envolved to see what was right in from of me. She’s been suffering seizures for years that she said Dr. Didn’t know what was causing it and I believed her. Everytime I would see or talk to her in seemed that the doctors had a differently theory., and again, I believe her everytime But recently I’ve realized that she’s been having seizures because she’s so emaciated. And I feel stupid, has something like this happened to anyone else? When I look back (I’ve knows her since childhood) I feel like I should of known from this start as she’s showed signs of a eating disorder since childhood. I’ve tried to talk to her about this and she’s completely shut me out. There have been time when she’s been close to death in the hospital and none of her extended family or friends know (her and her parents are extremely secretive about her mysteries health oroblems) which of course is her eating Disorder. I still can’t belive if took me this long to figure it out. Has this happened to anyone else. I just wish I had noticed sooner and tried to help her.",BobJ48,"Tue,11/19/2019-11:35am","Hey Jennie,Yes, people with eating disorders often want to hide their situation.  Not necessarily because of shame, but more that they don't want to be a burden on their friends.  They also understand that as soon as others find out, there will inevitably be pressure on them to recover. And frequently, even though they are having lots of medical and emotional issues, a big part of themselves really doesn't want to recover.And if they do want to recover, there's still no universally acknowledged cure for EDs, so it's not like they can just snap their fingers and start getting better, even if they or their friends might want them too. So there's the general intractability of the condition to consider as well. So yes, from their standpoint, often it's just a lot less complicated overall for them to hide their situation from people, even if it involves lying sometimes.  One often wonders how they can get away with it, but as far as their parents and friends are concerned, it's just human nature for people to ""not want there to be problems"", so quite often it never occurs to folks that there could actually be one.  Doctors frequently have not received training about EDs, so they often don't see an issue either.  You would think that people's blood tests and such would look terrible, and that this would alert doctors to an issue.  But sometimes people's blood work looks perfectly fine, even when they are deep into their ED. Plus you really can't expect the public to be on the alert for EDs.  Sure they know they exist, but it's all kind of abstract to them, and not something they actually expect to run into. Besides, we tend to admire people who are slender, and golly, fitness really is the thing these days, and don't you wish you had the motivation to spend all that time at the gym like your friend does ?  So it can be easy for folks to hide their situation. And avoid all of the various types of complications that might arise for them, if others really knew what their story was. So really, I hope you won't get too down on yourself for not figuring this out earlier. I'm pretty sure that it's because your friend didn't want you to worry for her, so she just hid what the heart of the matter was.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm afraid that it would be a little difficult to talk to the helpline as it's not my ED, and I have no clue what exactly is going on in her head. Do you have any further tips on how to ask her questions about it without offending her or being intrusive?",BobJ48,"Fri,08/23/2019-1:27pm","I'm sorry to hear about your friend, and yes, it can be hard to know exactly what to say that's going to help matters for her.  And you are right, now that she officially has a diagnosis, that really can be the sort of thing that changes how she looks at her situation.  From what you've said, it seems like being diagnosed has kind of backfired, in that now she's giving herself permission to really fulfill the criterion of her diagnosis, and may be eating even less than she did before.  :-(You didn't mention if she was getting any therapy though.  A lot of people get diagnosed, but have problems getting help, so they mindfully lose more and more weight as a means to convince themselves that they actually are worthy of help.  They can lose more as a way to try and show doctors and parents that they need help too.  Or they can simply be going for it in a general sense, and not be interested in getting help at all.  But yeah, for people who aren't recovered, watching the scale continue to go down can serve a lot of different mental and emotional purposes. This is just me of course, but as far as how to help goes, I'm not sure that asking her a lot of questions is the way to go.  What I generally do is try and put myself in their shoes, and empathize with some of the things I know they must be feeling.  ""It must be hard to know how things are going to turn out with all this."" - Things like that, which you know they must be thinking about.  You can't really fix your friend, but if you can give her an idea that you understand at least some of what she must be going through, and that you respect the various emotional struggles she's having,  that's the thing that's  going to feel supportive to her.  Rather than you directly trying to convince her to do one thing or the other, if you follow what I mean ? EDs can be very lonely things, so if you can help her to talk about her concerns, without being judgmental, then they aren't quite so alone anymore, and that really is a way we can help I think, as our friends try and work this all out for themselves. Keep in touch ?",koifish22,"Fri,08/23/2019-7:03pm","BobJ48,
I fear that you are correct in the sense of her wanting to ""fulfill the criterion"" for the diagnosis, which is truly scary. And I've tried my best to be supportive of her since I first recognized her ED, but what scares me the most, is that I used to try different diets with her. I used to do a lot of digging on the internet for good diets, and I always shared them with her and so we tried them together. That sounds normal, but what scares me about it is that she justifies every restriction, every pound lost, and every meal skipped by saying ""oh it's a new diet"" or ""I'm fasting"".. She also has depression, which has seemed to get less severe after she started going out with her current boyfriend, but it doesn't seem like she's gonna tell him about the ED which could mean her depression coming bak in full force if she starts feeling lonely in her struggle.
     Every time I try to reach out to her and talk about it, she's all of the sudden busy, or needs to go talk to people nearest to us. She has decided that (even though she's been diagnosed) she's fine, and that she still needs to be much thinner.  I've never really had an ED myself, but I have depression and even though that's one way to sympathize with her, I can't really empathize with her. And I imagine it's making her feel lonely too. She's been denying treatment, and won't talk to us about it, but knowing her, when this is done and through with, she's gonna say that she wished she reached out sooner.
     I don't know how to empathize with her, or talk to her about it calmly without offending her or sounding intrusive. And I feel so..helpless. I really don't know how I can reach out to her anymore..

Thanks,Savedbygrace ,"Mon,08/12/2019-11:01pm","We are not allowed to do private messaging, but we are here for you.   What's going on?",BobJ48,"Tue,08/13/2019-11:24am","MFL,This can happen for sure.  Because to be frank, people with eating disorders often want to keep pushing forward with their behaviors, and want to keep losing weight.  They have a pretty good idea that people who care about them will disapprove of this, so often they will start pushing their friends away. Or they think that others simply won't ""get it"" about why they are compelled to keep losing. Outsiders can have overly-simplistic views of both why they are doing what they do, and what it would take to get better.  It would just be easier to keep their distance from those who don't understand. On the other hand, often you hear people with EDs express sorrow over how much their ED has taken from them. Loss of friends is something they often mention with sadness. Losses they feel responsible for themselves. So that's kind of what you are up against with your friend.  And as you may be seeing, it could be difficult to talk to her about this in person.So one thing to consider is writing her a letter.  Like one that you write out on paper.  Let her know your concerns. Letters give the person some time to think about what you've said. Plus they can tell that you really care, just by the fact that you took the time to do this.One thing to keep in mind is that you can't fix her. But you can be supportive of her as a human being.  If that makes any sense ?Keeping the person in touch with the real world is another thing you can do.  Just hang out and doing normal things. If they will allow that I mean.  Folks with EDs can really begin to isolate themselves, and when it's just them and ED spending time alone with each other, that's usually not a good thing. Anyhow, just some thoughts.   Keep writing ?BobJ",koifish22,"Tue,08/20/2019-6:10pm","I have a friend currency doing the exact same thing. What has worked best for me was pretending I didn't care and then researching it. After thorough research, I would randomly say something about a ""new diet"" that safely helps lose weight (even though they didn't really) and would glorify the diets, and tried to convince her to try them with me. After awhile, she had started eating new and different foods with me in different ways than normal, and she looked healthier. But the tricky part about this is that by pretending not to care, you have to make sure to still spend time with them, just never talk about the ED. Make sure to make lots of plans with them, and ALWAYS have food as an option with your plans. a good trick is anytime there is a new restaurant, take them there and tell them y'all have to try the food there cuz it's supposed to be really good. This works for her, and I'm not sure if it works for you. Also, be careful that she doesn't start to think that you are ignoring her problem. If she ever asks, just say that you felt like you didn't know how to help but that you hated seeing them like that. Yes, It's a bit of a guilt trip, but it makes them stop and think about how they're affecting everyone else.Just a couple of suggestions though, I'm no expert. You may want to tweak them a little to best benefit your friend. I hope they get better!!

12,08/03/2019,LivingwithbestfriendwithED,Ellalouise714,"Thank you so much in advance to anyone who reads all of this and can offer guidance.I’m going to be sharing an apartment with one of my best friends this year (moving in one week) who has a long history of ED.Some context: I’ve known this friend for almost 10 years. We met freshman year of college and were best friends all through school. Truly, she was and still is one of my very best friends. I knew she had a problem when I first met her and she eventually opened up and spilled everything to me sophomore year. Her behaviors are feeling compelled to over-exercise, strict rules about what foods she can eat when, and I have known her to occasionally binge/not be in control of how much she eats in one sitting. I think a lot of this was originally caused by her parents, who expect perfection out of her and can be really irrational/cruel. To complicate things, she also has a medical condition that can cause her to gain lots of weight quickly when she becomes stressed out. When this happens, she gets really depressed and is unable to lose weight through exercise or restricting food. All that to say: she has moments when she is honest about what’s happening, but her baseline is to deny that anything is wrong/downplay the seriousness of things.Fast forward to now. We are both in our late 20’s, I just moved a few months ago to the city she’s been living in for the past few years, and we’re going to be roommates this lease cycle. Since we graduated/before I moved here, we’ve had seasons when we’ve talked a lot and seasons when we’ve been out of touch. A couple of years ago, she got really, really skinny again and had to go home/take time off from her graduate program. I know she spent at least a night or two in the hospital (which she downplayed) and she is now on an antidepressant which she’s told me has helped. When I moved here a few months ago she seemed to be doing really well and was at a healthy weight. She still exercises religiously but I don’t get the sense that it’s way too much. Since being here though, I’ve noticed she is going straight to the bathroom after any meal she eats. Doesn’t matter if it’s at a restaurant or at somebody’s house. I haven’t approached her about my worry that she’s throwing up her meals. A couple of weeks ago, she lost her grandmother (who was like a mother to her) and it has sent her into a downward spiral of guilt/grief/pushing everyone away. She has lost a lot of weight in a matter of weeks. Add into the mix that she’s taking a really stressful class this summer and trying to find a job that pays well. She has acknowledged that she has unhealthy ways of coping and needs to go to a therapist, but that’s not super realistic at this point, as her budget is really tight right now. I am moving into her apartment next weekend. ANY suggestions or guidance from someone who has struggled with an ED personally or has tried to support a friend in a similar situation would be so appreciated. I don’t want to do anything that would make her feel guilty, defensive, or like she can’t confide in me. Thank you so much.",BobJ48,"Sun,08/04/2019-2:36pm","Ella,Yes, I think you are right in assuming she's purging, when you see her head off to the bathroom like this.  This was certainly how it was with my friend.  I was at a dinner once too, where I began to suspect one of the guests had an ED, and it was the same thing : right after dinner, off to the bathroom she went. What you can do for your friend is mostly just listen.  That doesn't seem like much I know. Because we'd like to be able to fix them. Which we can't.  But listening is one area that's legitimately open to us, and where we can make a difference.One thing that you'll also need to watch out for is how all of this is going to effect you.  It's quite likely that you'll be regularly faced with behaviors  which are alarming, but which you can't do anything about. Your friend may try and hide her behaviors from you, but knowing that this sort of concealment is what's going on can be unsettling too.  How well you'll be able to deal with all of this is something you'll need to consider. One thing you might do is to talk to her about these concerns right from the start, and ask her what she thinks you might do ?  Because it could be just as hard for you as it is for her, if she feels that she has to do a lot of pretending, and hiding everything from you.One other thing which might help you manage better and feel less helpless is if she does find a way to get some type of therapy. We want to be supportive, but as you may find, they need to provide us with things to support.If you should see this, keep writing ?",koifish22,"Tue,08/20/2019-6:16pm","Your roommate has another level of ED because she now has depression.

I know it can be frustrating when you want to help someone in your family but are stopped by family.  My guess is that if she does go to the dietician, they will know more fully what is going on with your niece and won't be fooled by her excuses.  They may be able to help your sister understand what is going on.  If you just want to reach out to your niece and let her know you are there for her if she ever wants to talk, it may open up the door down the road for her to open up to you about her eating difficulties. Right now it sounds like she is not open to any kind of help, but if you let her know you are there for her if she needs to talk, it may be a good place to start.  Do you live nearby?  Can you take her someplace she likes and you can have some privacy to talk?  It is very kind and caring of you to be concerned and to want to help your niece.  That is wonderful.  I hope she gets the help she needs as the earlier this is caught the better chances for recovery.  Keep in touch and let us know how things are going.iwanttolive and I am",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,03/12/2019,SupportingmyBestFriend,Lilac54,"Hi all,My best friend and roommate has been suffering from bulimia for a number of years.

My question is, outside of encouraging her to continue with therapy, how can I be as supportive as possible? I don't know if I should be pointing out things like bruising on her legs or how I rarely ever see her eat a meal. I'm one of the only friends she feels comfortable with talking candidly about her ED and I don't want to say the wrong thing or accidentally push her away. I try to encourage/remind her to eat and I make sure to never make comments about my own body in front of her. I honestly just feel scared that I'm going to say something wrong and do more damage than good. I want more than anything for her to love herself and regain some control over her eating. Any help is appreciated <3",iwanttolive,"Wed,03/13/2019-9:34pm","Hi and welcome to the forum.  I am glad to hear you are supporting your friend.  It can be very scary to see someone you love and care about suffer and not know what to do.  My best suggestion is to ask your friend how she wants you to be a support to her.  Making sure she is eating and encouraging her to eat may or may not be the most helpful thing for her.  She knows she needs to eat.  I would share with her your concerns that you don't want to say the wrong thing and are afraid of pushing her away.  I would be honest about your concerns and then leave it up to her to tell you what she feels she wants and needs from you.  Sometimes just listening and her knowing that you are there for her means a lot.  If it seems that she is in danger or there is an emergency, I would tell her that you are concerned and that you need to let someone in authority at the campus know or if you are not living on campus, then you may need to call 911.  She may be angry but if it is an emergency, it is more important to help her this way and deal with the anger at a later time. But for now, you are doing a great job at caring for her and being there for her.  I know it can be difficult.  Again, ask her what she needs and wants.  Let her know of your fears of saying the wrong thing and pushing her away.  That way you aren't so worried all the time and be stressed yourself while you need to be focused on your studies and other things as well.  I hope this helps.  Take care and post anytime.  iwanttolive",BobJ48,"Thu,03/14/2019-12:56pm","It can be hard to know what to say that's going to sound caring, but here's one way to think about it.   If you see signs of her not eating, or become aware that she might be purging, rather than commenting on what she may or may not be doing, ask her how she is feeling instead.Because having someone to share her fears and feelings with, that's going to be what feels most helpful to her.  Rather than us inquiring about the person's ED behaviors.Also, people in her situation can often find themselves full of self-doubt and self-hate. That really can be one of the worst mental aspects of eating disorders, and you may have already heard her make comments about herself like that.  So one other practical thing you can do, is when you see an opportunity, point out the goodness you see in her. Not just generalities like ""Oh, I know you to be a good person"" but be specific.  Has she made caring comments about others, or about how things should be better in the world ?  People who actually are hateful would never think to care about things like that.  So comments like : ""It shows what a good-heated person you are, that you would care about that."" are things that can help her gain a less hateful perspective on herself.",idk_how,"Wed,05/15/2019-12:49am","I love my friend so much and I feel so ignorant not realizing that she has been having problems with food up until recently, and I really want to make her feel better but I don't know how. shes average weight but she's been eating a lot less in the last few months because she feels really insecure, but after eating some small yogurt or something along those lines she feels absolutely terrible for eating and feels so much guilt and I just want her to get better but I don't know how.
She understands what she's doing isn't healthy but she cant stop herself.",BobJ48,"Fri,05/17/2019-4:07am","Dear idk,First off, I hope you won't be too hard on yourself for not being more aware of her eating issues.  EDs are secretive things, and what may seem like obvious signs now, may have seemed like just normal concerns to begin with. It's easy to think that if we reassure the person that it's OK to eat, or try and use logic to talk them out of their habits. than that's the way to go about things.  But it sounds like you may have already figured out how well that works.  Generally not very well at all, unfortunately.The thing to keep in mind is that usually EDs are ""about"" things other than food or weight. Stressful episodes in the person's life, unreasonable negative self-judgments, worries about never being good enough, feeling as though they don't have control over important aspects of their life, difficulties in relationships and in home life - These are common triggers for eating disorders, and may be things you can help her talk about.  Things that really don't have a lot to do directly with food or eating you know ?I'm not sure if she is getting professional help or not, but if she isn't, that might be a decision you could help her to make. Not so much ""you should do this"" or ""you should do that"", but more letting her know that you understand how deciding to get help can be a difficult decision.EDs are tough things, so be prepared for things not always going in the sorts of directions you might hope they would go. That often comes with the territory too.  The main thing is staying a sympathetic friend, and someone she'll feel safe talking to.In any case, just some thoughts.

15,05/13/2019,Friendwon'ttalkaboutit,supportivebff,"Hey!A few weeks ago my best friend came to me and told me she's been struggling with bulimia for the last few months. (I figured its been about 6 or so weeks, looking back and seeing her symptoms)When she told me, she said she wanted to see a therapist, and the day before she had a breakdown about it and wanted the help. The next night she slept over, we had one slice of pizza, and I stood by the door when she was in the bathroom and she didn't purge. She also told me that morning that she felt better that she told someone, but she doesn't want to discuss it unless she brings it up because it bothers her, and I respected that.  She was doing well for about a week, I was with her on vacation and she was fine and then one night I noticed she used behaviors. I got really upset and cried about it to her, and she said she was fine, she's handling it on her own and she'll beat it like she beat depression last year. Through all this she says she's still depression free and is in a good place mentally. However, since we got back from our vacation, she's been unwell. I see her isolating herself a bit more, and she's been really moody. I know she's taking it day by day, but I'm worried because she was eating so normally and healthy on vacation. Today she said she wasn't going to eat anything and I didn't say anything because I am trying to respect her space, but at the same time be supportive. I always offer her something to eat, and I've been saying encouraging things to her that aren't related to her weight. Today she seemed to be in a really dark place, I haven't seen her like that ever....but also she was looking up recipes and planning her meals. I just want to get a grasp on how to help her, because it seems like she's trying but on her own and its taking a toll on her mentally. I don't know where to go from here. How do I support her but stay within my boundaries? I'm someone who likes to help people, so seeing her suffer without being able to do anything is making me feel helpless and anxious.",iwanttolive,"Tue,05/14/2019-8:52pm","Hello and welcome to the forum.  I am glad you posted and that you care so much for your friend.  Eating disorders are very complex and difficult to deal with, for all involved.  It is a difficult situation to be in when your friend told you what is going on but then to tell you not to be involved.  Well, she got you involved.  It will be more difficult now for you to not want to know how she is doing.  Recovering from bulimia or any eating disorder is very difficult when trying to recover on one's own.  It is really important to get a therapist and a medical doctor involved as bulimia is very dangerous and can be life threatening.  I do not mean to scare you by saying this, but even if one is only suffering for a short while a lot of things can go wrong and it is really important that she get checked out by a medical doctor.  I do not know if she would be open to this.  I think it would be okay to voice your concerns once more and to ask her if she would be willing to be checked out by a doctor, have lab work done, to make sure all is okay.  The doctor would need to know of the bulimia and from what it sounds like, she may not be inclined to go.  Otherwise I would just let her know that you are there for her and that you want to support her, but you need to keep in mind that you are not and can not be her therapist.  That is unfair of her to expect that of you and not good for her as she needs professional help.  But if she wants to talk and you want to listen, that is being supportive.  If you sense that she needs more, I would tell her that you are uncomfortable and feel she needs more help than you are able to give her.  It is a very difficult situation.  Most of the time, unless someone wants the help, or to get better, no one can force them.  No one can stop them from purging of binging or restricting.  The person has to want the help  and then it is difficult even then.  So thank you for caring enough about your friend to post here.  Also, you may want to call NEDA or chat with them to see what their input is.  I hope this was helpful.  Post anytime and let us know how things are going.  iwanttolive and I am",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,05/05/2019,onlisteningandTMI,horseshoecrab,"I don't have a friend with an eating disorder - I have one myself. I'm in recovery, and things are mostly okay except when they're not (like how it's late at night and I'm still up because I can't go to bed until I digest all that food that I really wish I hadn't eaten.) But I'm thinking:I know so much of this stuff is individual/subjective, but how much sharing is too much? How much is too little? I want to tell my close friends, or the person I'm in a relationship with, how *bad* things are sometimes, how much I need their support right then, that I had a bad ED day and I need someone to be there for me. But then they ask me how my day was and I just go, ""Okay."" or sometimes ""Bad,"" with no explanation. Oh, I could tell you so many things you don't want to know, but - how much do people want to listen? What if I need to say it to them, and not just to a therapist?I dunno. Listening to people with ED makes you feel helpless but having one makes me feel alone.",BobJ48,"Mon,05/06/2019-6:03pm","You know, how much we tell a person about our issues, and what details we describe…I think that has a lot to do with how much they have educated themselves about those issues in the first place.Like if they already know what behaviors are like, you probably don't have to go into a lot of detail with them.  Because they'll already know what you are talking about.But if they don't know much about the particular matter…what then ?Again, it may have to do with that they understand already.   Do they understand what it's like to have difficulties of their own ?  ""Today was a struggle"" might be all that they need to hear, in order to understand and to sympathize. But yeah, if they aren't familiar with anything themselves, then what ? Honestly, I'm not sure that it should be your job to educate them.  If they act truly interested, perhaps there are some sites, or some books you could direct them to, so that they could educate themselves.  If they don't act interested, then perhaps they don't need to know anything, and that they are not the people who you should be confiding in. Anyhow, just some thoughts.  How much the other person actually cares about us…that has a lot to do with it I think.  xx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,03/14/2019,FriendinNeed,Chad123,"My friend has a disorder that's similar, but unlike any of the other disorders that I've seen on the internet so far. He does not enjoy the taste of most foods and his body does not give off the same hunger signals that most people get, so he is not hungry, but not eating enough and what he eats his body usually tries to reject because it tastes so bad to him. The only times I've been able to get him to eat with me is buying going out and getting fast food. I worry that he is not getting enough nutrition. Because he is not eating enough he is also very skinny and gets weak very easily. I was wondering if anyone knew any foods that are really good at helping someone gain weight/get needed vitamins that's either in the fast food industry or something that could be easy to make at home. Unfortunately, I don't have much experience with dealing with someone with an eating disorder, so I'm trying to be as supportive as i can be without pushing too hard.

18,03/04/2019,Needadviceaboutacolleague/friend,calvin22,"Hi all,I have a colleague (who is also a good friend) who I strongly suspect has a purging disorder. My sister has struggled with bulimia her whole life, so I recognize similar patters/behaviours in my friend (although, admittedly, she is very good at hiding it).We can talk about almost everything - except this subject. I attempted to breach the subject once and she laughed it off (but she did admit that she was bulimic when younger).She has a long term partner, whom I don't know well and can't say whether he knows or not. Nor do I know if her family is aware. She doesn't have many close friends so I wonder if I am the only one who has these strong suspicions.At this stage, I am concerned about her health (both physical and mental).What should I do? I asked my sister and she said not to push too hard. Is it my business (not really)? Do I turn a blind eye? Do I try bringing it up again? If so, how? If she denies is again, then what?",calvin22,"Wed,03/06/2019-9:40am","Also worth noting, I had reviewed the advice already available on this site and followed the guidance. It met with resistance so just wondering what next!",iwanttolive,"Wed,03/06/2019-11:40pm","Hi, Welcome to the forum.  I am encouraged to hear how much you care about your friend.  And that you spent time on the forum to see how others have dealt with similar situations.  How is your sister doing now?  As for your friend,  did you say something again and is this the resistance you are referring to?  I know that as someone who struggled with an eating disorder for a very long time, and am now in recovery, it was difficult when people would tell me I needed help.  I knew it on a deep level, but would never give people the satisfaction of agreeing.  First, I needed to ""protect"" myself against the eating disorder being taken away as it was needed, or so I thought.  What it did in was nearly  kill me instead and ruined a good part of my life.  I think it is so kind of you and caring to be thinking of your friend and wanting to help her.  Perhaps you can write her a letter, I suggest writing it instead of texting or e mailing as it is more private and personal.  I would tell her why you are concerned, that you knew someone you were close to who suffered with bulimia and that you see some similar behaviors or actions in her that this other person did.  You may or may not want to say it is your sister to protect her confidentiality.  In my belief, it is better to have a falling out with a friend if it means they may listen and get help.  It may save her life.  But it is up to you.  If you are a praying man, I would consider praying about it first and asking God what direction He thinks you should go in.  Again it takes a caring person to even notice another one who is suffering.  Thank you.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,09/17/2018,Help!WeddingStressonBulimicFriend,esbee,"My best friend is getting married next month. She has struggled with bulimia since high school (we are now in our late 20's) but has been doing well the last few years. Once the wedding started to get closer, her bulimia resurfaced. When I encouraged her to seek help, she refused to go back to the therapist that had helped her before because she said she's too busy with wedding planning and therapy is too expensive. As a result, I've watched her tailspin in an awful cycle for the better part of a year. She has latched on to an online fitness influencer that does a lot of ""challenges"". Once a month or so, she'll ask me to do a challenge with her. I'm a pretty healthy person these days, I work out regularly and use flexible dieting to stay in good shape, so I can't bring myself to participate in these challenges, but I have always supported her in what she believes will be best for her. Well, today I just hit a little bit of a breaking point. Her wedding is in just over a month, and she believes that she has to lose a certain amount of weight before the wedding day so she is cutting all sugar, dairy and alcohol (worth noting: these are all the things she binges on) from her diet and forcing herself to do multiple workouts every day. This is not healthy, and I can't stand by and support it. I know that this is just going to result in her going hardcore on this challenge for maybe 3 or 4 days, getting exhausted and stressed, and then having a binge and purging. It's a cycle I know well at this point and I can't bear to see it starting again and just stand by her as she does it. I expressed this concern to her, and practically begged her to focus on moderation and what makes her feel healthy, but she basically told me that her health is something to worry about after the wedding, but right now losing that weight is all that matters. She is very defensive when anyone challenges her on knowing what's best for her health, and I'm worried that not giving her the support she is asking of me may make things a million times worse. At the same time, my conscience is tearing me up about supporting something that I know will just make her condition worse and may end with a hospital visit instead of a happy wedding. I just don't know what to do. Has anyone else been in a similar position? Any suggestions you have will be most welcome.

20,02/21/2019,Lostandfeelinghelpless,tryingfriend,"An internet friend of mine has an eating disorder and lately it's been really hard watching her go through this and feeling like there's nothing I can do to help her. We've been friends for almost a year, and she told me pretty early on that she struggles with anorexia. For a while it seemed like I was able to help her; assuring her that it's okay to get a snack if she's hungry, reminding her that her struggles are valid, listening to her when she's feeling scared and letting her know that she's safe. But lately it's felt more and more like I can't help her anymore. We start getting into debates because she comes to me saying she's scared or stressed because she had lunch and she's still hungry and I try and tell her that that's normal and it's okay to have a snack. I know that by her coming to me it means there's a part of her that wants to get better, she knows I'm going to encourage her to do what deep, deep down she knows is best, but it's like she's also trying to convince herself through convincing me that it's okay to just not eat.
Her parents aren't the greatest people in the world. When she went to them in the past for help with mental illness they didn't give her the resources she needed and it changed nothing, but they won't go any other way. She's still a minor, but in the state she lives in she can legally receive outpatient care for mental health without parental consent; the only thing is, I have no clue how to convince her that she needs to do it. She's terrified of getting better and refuses to even think about it. She's also scared of the things that could happen to her health if she gets worse, but she's more willing to do things that aren't good for her health to try and find that control she longs for and reach her goal weight.
I just don't know what to do anymore. If I try and convince her to get help she spirals, but if I say nothing or tell her she doesn't need to think about getting help right now I feel like I'm enabling her to continue ruining herself. It's especially hard when we live states apart and I can only help her online and not in person. My question is, does anyone have any tips on how to approach the situation and maybe convince her to get the help she both needs and deserves?",Erin_Patricia1,"Sun,02/24/2019-4:08pm","Hi tryingfriend,First off, I wanted to welcome you to the NEDA online community forums!

21,02/18/2019,AdvicePlease,GingerSnapz,"Hi there. My daughter's good friend (a teen) was recently hospitalized with anorexia. I found out from her mother. When I broke the news about her friend's hospitalization to my daughter, she already knew because she has been getting texts from her from the hospital. The friend is in denial, very angry about being hospitalized, feels it is against her will. Obviously there is concern of her not consenting to treatment.  Before I told my daughter, I had asked her mother would be appropriate from us for support. Mom told me that the teen doesn't have access to phone or media. But it seems that isn't true because she has been texting my daughter. I don't want to jeopardize the trust between her and my daughter, she obviously needs support. Do I tell Mom that her daughter may have access to a phone?",BobJ48,"Thu,02/21/2019-12:25pm","Snapz,I'm sure there will be different opinions on this.  Some will say that your daughters' friend should be kept in line, and her phone discovered and taken away from her.  That those in authority know what's best for her, and that strict treatment is just what she needs. Even if that means that the trust she's given your daughter should be betrayed. Even so, I think that there may be value in the fact that she feels that she has at least one person who she's able to be honest with her feelings.  Perhaps these are not the same feelings that others might wish to force her to have, but they are her feelings none the less.  And may be different than what she tells those who are trying to control her.  But apparently she has one person who's input she feels she might trust, and that's what's coming from your daughter.  And there could be some possible value in that.One thing to keep in mind is that situations like this can deteriorate into wars of will, which rarely improves matters I feel.  EDs are often about control, and the more the person feels that others are trying to control them, the more they just dig in their heels. In any case, the choice is up to you in this matter.  If it were me, I'd be glad that this girl has at least one person who she feels safe to talk to, during a difficult time when she doesn't feel safe, and her thoughts must be all over the place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,01/23/2019,DeliriumThoughts,Dark_Twin,"I should have discovered this safe place a long time ago. Now it’s too late.
I will write to free my heart.
I would like to write a story. The story of my greatest friendship of which I am guilty of putting an end to it.
I am here writing in a foreign language because I hope someone can learn from my mistakes.What hurts is not knowing. I will never know why she has distanced herself from me.
Was it my fault? Did I do something wrong, as usual?
What was supposed to do? What was expected of me?
Why did everything seem ok to me?I thought if she was felt ill, she would tell me. I was convinced that our friendship was stronger than any disease.
I was always on her side. Always. I protected her or I believed to do it.She was B. I was V.
I want to tell you the story of a friendship lost for my stupidity. How many friendships have been destroyed by love?
Maybe I was looking for her too often. Maybe I hugged her too much. Maybe I hold her too close.Two chaos meet, they get close and then they drift apart.
Yin and Yan, two opposites hug each other with a point of the other within themselves.
She was graceful and kind. I was brave and sassy. The same sensibility has led us to the ocean of pain.
We had two different sufferings, two different mental illness.
I wonder if in the end it was the same face wearing two different masks: depression and anorexia.
When we were together, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. The fire lived in our hug.At a certain point she started to avoid me.
I thought that she didn’t want me anymore, that she replaced me with other new friends.
Now I’ll always wonder for the rest of my life how it would have been different if I had waited a while longer her to open up.
But for me it was impossible to just sit and watch her slipped out of my hands.Don’t make my own mistakes. Regret is a heartrending grief, a litany of tears and nightmares.
Don’t be impatient to see her, to hug her, to protect her and to make her laugh.
Don’t run to see her smile again.I was convinced that if I was right there beside her, nothing could hurt her.
I didn’t understand that evil was already inside her. Even if people didn’t see it.
I used to love her. Even if people didn’t see it.
Now B. is recovering without me and it’s slowly clawing at my soul.Where am I for her? Who am I for her?
I am not among anymore the people that count for her.
I’m no longer a part of her family, although we considered ourselves twins.
I’m not among real friends who have decided to stay with her in all this long and unpleasant journey.I’m a friendship lost.
I’m yesterday. I’m the past to forget. I have never left her. I have always thought of her. She only exists in my mind. Even if people don’t see it.
I lost my whole world, my true love, my heart. Even if people don’t see it.I’m sorry.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,01/27/2019-11:31pm","Hi Dark_Twin,Welcome to the NEDA online community forums.

Thanks for listening to me.I have a bit of difficulty to write in English, I'm comforted to see how much you managed to understand me anyway.I'm ok, I think I might be ok.I don't want to belittle the pain of those who go through this suffering, but nobody talks about the pain of those who lives next to the sick person. Nobody talks about it. Except here.
 Trying to give always optimism, even if you want to scream is frustrating.We were close, but despite this I was blind and I did not see how bad she was. I was wrong. Some things can not be forgiven. We were twins, I should have noticed. If not me, who else?And I do not think she'll ever come back to me. It's not her thing.
 And then she will have other things to think about, I can only imagine how challenging the recovery is and she has other people to support her.I was always the one who came back to her. This made me feel insecure because I was afraid of being intrusive.
 I remember once I wanted to keep her at arm's lenght to understand if our friendship was one-sided. The situation has degenerated, we had become strangers. When I got tired and went back to her, I said, ""Why didn't you talk to me?"" she replied in a fit of pique ""Because you didn't talk to me."" I found her disappointment almost touching.The line between giving space and abandoning is blurred. At least I never understood where one of them ended and the other one began.
I know her. She doesn't come out of her shell. And I can't retrace my steps because I would be a fake and a hypocrite.This situation is like a puzzle, you have no idea how much I thought about it.

It does not mean that you were an uncaring person.  EDs are very complicated things, and they are often hidden in secrecy. Sometimes we think that ""Love is all we need"",  and that if we have enough love, then that will be the answer.  But unfortunately EDs are more complicated than that.Really, all we can expect of ourselves is to do the best that we can, with the things that we know, at the time that things happened. ""If I had only known to do this, or if I had only done that"" - That is not a fair way to judge ourselves. What I hope you can do, is to find comfort in the fact that you brought your best intentions to the situation.  No one can ask more of themselves than that. "" This situation is like a puzzle, you have no idea how much I thought about it.""No, I have a good idea about how you must feel.  But if the other person does not give us their parts of the puzzle, then there really is no way that we can hope to put to put the puzzle together and truly understand things.   We can do our very best with our half of the situation, but if the other person is not willing to do their best for us with their half, then it's possible that we may always be puzzled. Which is a very difficult thing, but something  that we will have to find emotional ways to make our peace with.",Dark_Twin,"Tue,01/29/2019-11:39pm","I had already read posts on the forum, surprised by the support I wanted to share my experience. I do not think I wrote in the wrong section, in the end we were just friends. You both say that I did my best, but I'm not sure. What if she gave me some puzzle pieces and I just did not notice it?Bob, the ED of her had not been hidden from me, not quite. We met in the tunnel, I got to the point of cutting myself. I stopped just to stop those around me looking at me scared. But the simple act of stopping it helped me to recover.I think this experience has influenced me, because when I saw that she had overcome it on the physical plane, I immediately thought that the worst was gone.I remember that I gave her a book of a person about her past experience with anorexia, she liked it so much that she identified herself with the author. Evidently it was not enough.I know for sure that she now has someone beside her.
I know she is not alone, at least in appearance.
Yet within me I can not help wondering how much these strangers know about her.She is precious and I trust only myself.My feelings may seem like selfishness or jealousy, but in reality what I feel is the awareness of being able to take care of her better than before, better than anyone else. Because I know my twin, because she went through too dark, because she is a flower and my love is real and deep.Despite everything I would like her back.
I would like to be with her, but not for an illness. Not because she is healing.
But because I miss her more than I can say in words.I do not care if it's in recovery, or sick, or clean. I would always be next to her in any situation and space-time dimension. I have known her and it will not be a mental illness to stop the love I feel towards her.But I do not know if she misses me even just a little bit. If she has distanced me without the intention because of the illness, is it possible that she actually wants to see me?How can I understand it without being intrusive or hypocritical or selfish?",Savedbygrace ,"Wed,01/30/2019-2:22pm",Ask her.

I am sorry for the position you are in. Maybe your Mom can share with his mother her insights and thoughts?  How are you doing?  It this causing your struggle to worsen?  I would suggest talking to your Mom and tell her of your concerns for him and that you want him to get help.  Maybe the two of you can figure something out.  That way you won't feel like you are breaking a confidence.  Sometimes though, for the sake of health, it needs to be done.  Better to lose a friend in terms of fellowship that to lose that friend to death.  A though answer I know.  Eating disorders are deadly as I think you may be aware of.  I will pray that you know what to do. Please let us know how things go.  I am also sorry this sat for such a long time

24,01/15/2019,Myfriendwithbulimia,maddz,"My best friend, let’s call her Max has an eating disorder. I noticed something was going on some time ago, maybe two months? But I wasn’t sure and her behaviour was pretty normal so I ignored it(I know I shouldn’t have). Few days ago she told me that she is struggling with bulimia for 6 months already. She said, that she realized that she can’t handle it on her own, so she told her mom about it. At first her mom ignored what she said. When she repeated the same thing, only thing she heard in response was 'don’t exaggerate'. After some time she started the same conversation. Her parents told her to just stop. After few more attempts they told her that for now she will be eating what they will tell her to and she cannot vomit. Today in school she told me almost crying that they don’t  want to send her to a doctor. I’m so sad that she is doing it, but I know she needs professional help. But if her parents say no, her  condition won’t improve. How can I help her? How can I give her support? What she/we can do to convince her parenltd that she’s not just making it up? I can already see that she has changed. I really don’t know what to do.Thanks in advance, Maddie",_admin_moderator,"Wed,01/16/2019-6:00pm","Hi, maddz, welcome to the NEDA forums.

If they have a nurse or a counselor at school, that's who I'd talk to, to see if they could help.Lot's of times parents won't take what their children say seriously, but if they hear the same things from adults who have authority, often they will pay more attention.In the mean time, your friend is fortunate to have such a caring person like yourself to talk to.  While we can't really expect to fix our friends ourselves, it's not good when they are alone with these worries, so you are already making a difference.  xx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,12/28/2018,"Myfriendadmittedshehasanorexia,thenliedandtookitback",HelpingAFriend ,"So one day me and two friends were talking about random stuff when my friend says (with sincerity) “I am anorexic”. She tried to brush past it, and I saw the regret in her face immediately after. It’s not that she didn’t trust us, she’s trusted me for a while, and the other girl for even longer, but she seemed like she didn’t believe herself. The problem with that is, me and the other girl already knew. She has for a while talked about over excersizing, not eating, and fearing weight gain (even though she’s about X pounds underweight already). Nowadays, she will talk in casual conversation about it, admitting that she has an ed. Me and the other girl present also have mental health problems, I especially joke a lot to cope so it’s a thing me and the girl with the ed tend to do on low days, I know it’s not good but I can’t get her to stop without being a hypocrite and I don’t want to stop myself. So she has no problem venting about how “oh I nearly passed out today lol” but the second me and the other girl try to talk seriously about it to see how we can help, she shuts down and starts panicking and saying “nah I’m fineeee you’re being ridiculousssss”. And if she’s not shutting us down she’s mad because we told her that she doesn’t need to worry about the calories in whatever food she’s currently worried about. Are we doing something wrong? Should we forgo her wishes and tell an adult (she’s only 15 after all)? Should we just tell her what’s shes doing is okay? I’m worried that saying anything she doesn’t want to hear will make her more secretive. I don’t know what to do.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,12/28/2018-9:19pm","We are glad that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

Your friend seems like she really does want to talk about her situation, or else she wouldn't be saying anything.  But yeah, when you treat it as serious, then she clams up. What this means to me is that even she doesn't quite know what to think about her situation.  Is she really ""fine"" or is she in trouble? It sounds like she doesn't quite know.  People can be pretty deep into their EDs and still not quite know what to think.  So you might want to say that to her :  ""I know it must be hard to know what to think about your situation.""   She may just repeat that everything's ""fine"", but it's also possible that she could say ""yeah"".  ""...if she’s not shutting us down she’s mad because we told her that she doesn’t need to worry about the calories in whatever food she’s currently worried about.""Well she's probably right in getting upset, because I think you can be certain that she does worry about calories.  To the point of obsession. So when you tell her she doesn't need to worry, you are kind of showing her that you just don't get it.  Which is probably what's making her angry.  Maybe the better thing to say is something like ""It must be difficult worrying about calories all the time like this.""  Because that would totally be true. What you are working towards is a place where she trusts that you get it, if you follow me ?  Which will make it easier for her to talk to you and to trust you.  Because it sounds to me like she's looking for that.  Someone to really tell, you know ?In the end she'll need to get some kind of help, like with the counsellor at school or telling her parents.  But it may take her a while to get brave enough to do something like that.  So you might say something like ""What do you think you'll do now?"", or ""Do you think that you're brave enough to talk to some one ?""So more like asking questions, rather than telling her what you think she should think, or what you think she should do.  Like so she can come to her own conclusions, you know ?Because these really are touchy situations, and like you've seen, it's easy for the person to just kind of…go back into hiding with it all. Which she's probably doing enough of already. But again, the fact that she's talking about it at all…that is something positive I think.",,,,,,,,,,,,
26,12/10/2018,OnlineFriendHasEDandWon'tGetHelp,friendneedshelp,"Hello, I have an online friend who I've been friends with for a while. She's starving herself and refusing to seek help until she ""reaches a certain weight"". She expresses that she feels panic when she eats and goes on frequent unhealthy fasts, and she's recently joined a pro-anorexia chat group because she says she doesn't want to recover yet and says she doesn't care what happens to her as long as she loses weight. What can I do to help her?",iwanttolive,"Tue,12/11/2018-10:06pm","Hi and welcome to the forum.  I am sorry about your friend.  Unfortunately until someone wants to get help, there is not much we can do, especially in your situation. If you knew more about this person, or where they lived, others that know them, that would be a little different.  You can encourage your friend to get help, give her NEDA's web site, share the dangers of anorexia, but if she doesn't want to get better, it is difficult. You can be there for her but if she is only going to talk about losing weight and isn't open to change, I myself would have to draw a boundary and say if you want to talk fine, but if you only want to talk about the anorexia and what she is doing to starve herself I wouldn't engage in that.  That is just something that I don't believe would be helpful for either of you.  If you knew her more and were able to tell someone that could intervene, that would be an option, but she is an online friend.  So unfortunately there is only so much we can do.  Please let us know how things go.  And if you need support we are here for you as well.  Thank you for caring.iwanttolive",BobJ48,"Wed,12/19/2018-2:02am","I'm with IW2L on this-it can be very difficult to convince someone to get help if they don't want to.  I speak with a lot of people like your friend, and really, one of the few approaches one can take is to agree with them, and commiserate when they talk about about the negative ways that their EDs are impacting their lives.  Because yeah, if a person is panicking about eating, and suffering through the sorts of things that come from starvation (both physical and mental), or how their studies are wiping out, or how they have a hard time hanging out with their friends anymore, or how their depression and anxiety is getting worse... they can generally agree with you that those things are a bummer.  Which…that's a perspective that they'll need to reach if they are ever going to begin thinking about recovery. I'm not sure what chat forum she's on, but in my experience there are frequently members on those places who are more than willing to admit that having an ED is a horrible thing which causes misery and serious disruption to the paths of peoples lives.  So while they may still be pressing forward with their EDs, at the same time, on most contemporary forums, there's also a general vibe that the ED situation is nothing that anyone would want to get involved with, and which large parts of their self would rather be free of.  One positive thing to all this is that even though you are a ""normie"", your friend IS indeed talking to you about this. Which in my opinion is way better than her being able to talk with no one besides her ED chat friends.  My sense is that she would not be talking to you at all, unless she was having some doubts about her situation.  A thing which is encouraging I think, even if she has not moved forward to the part where she's thinking about getting help.  A part which usually does show up sooner or later for people who are in her position.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,10/15/2018,Myfriendhasbulimiaanddoesn'twantmetotellanybody,pipsqueak97,"Hi all, Please help me. My best friend has bulimia and has been struggling for a few months now. She doesn't want me to tell anybody. As far as I know, I am the only one who knows. She goes to a different college many states away and so I am not in a position to see her all that frequently. I tell her that I will support her endlessly but at the end of the day, I can't make her do anything. I've asked her to see a doctor but she wants to get over it herself. She has asked me not to tell anybody or to pressure her into doing anything that she is not comfortable with yet.What should I do? Should I do anything? I am afraid that if I push her too hard then she'll just stop confiding in me and will feel like she has no one to talk to. On the other hand, it's so hard to go through this alone, and I can't really force her into doing anything. I'm so worried about her. It doesn't help that I can't be there with her. I'm worried that if she doesn't see someone or isn't able to get over it herself then she will end up being hospitalized or worse. Please tell me what to do. Thanks.",BobJ48,"Thu,10/18/2018-1:20pm","""Should I do anything? I am afraid that if I push her too hard then she'll just stop confiding in me and will feel like she has no one to talk to. On the other hand, it's so hard to go through this alone, and I can't really force her into doing anything.""One thing to keep in mind is that you actually are doing something already, simply by being someone she feels OK talking with.  That is not just nothing, it really is a thing that's important.  So yeah, you'll want to do all you can to retain her trust.Also, even if you were to tell someone, it's not like that would necessarily result in something positive. But I think you are right in warning her of the danger she might be in.  In the beginning people who purge often think they can stop whenever they want to, and frequently don't realize the sort situation they've gotten themselves into until they are totally addicted and discover that they can't stop.  A few months may not seem like that long, but you are right in worrying that she may be in a dangerous situation already.One thing to remember is that most people are not happy about the fact that they purge, so the idea that it's something they could be stuck with for years is often something that scares them, and can serve as a motivation to get help.  Also, it's *much* easier to quit early on, than to try and quit once this stuff has really had time to worm itself into a person's mind. Also, when it comes to ""recovering on her own"", when you stop to think about it, even people in treatment recover on their own.  No one else can make them recover other than themselves.  While some people actually do recover on their own, this brain of ours has a way of defeating our best efforts sometimes, and that really is the part that a person has to fight against.  And where getting some outside input can make a difference.Also, if your friend is at school, they will have counselors there who do understand eating disorders.  Your friend may feel shame over the idea that she has this issue, and that may be part of what's holding her back, but people at the counseling center will understand that part too, so I think that urging your friend to check them out is probably a step you'll want to suggest to her, and then do what you can to help her work though the sorts of emotional risks she'll need to take in order to make her first appointment. Because really, that's what recovery often requires : Being willing to take some emotional risks, you know ?Bob J.",iwanttolive,"Fri,11/23/2018-11:24pm",Hi.

28,10/04/2018,Ijustfoundoutmyfriendisanorexic...,nameuser,"So I have been worried that my friend may be anorexic for a couple of months now, but these suspicions were only slight and I only see her in the afternoon so I figured she was eating more just when I wasn't there. However we just went on a camping trip and I noticed she barely ate anything. When we got back, I was on my computer and I saw that her google account was still signed in (she borrowed my computer for school) and thinking about the anorexia, I snooped (I feel bad about it). The only document she edited on her google drive was a calendar of sorts labeled with her daily calorie intake and on another page was a bunch of exercises. I have come to the conclusion that she is definitely anorexic. This is VERY BAD and I am VERY WORRIED. She is my best friend. We are both sophomores in high school, but we go to different high schools. I will see her tomorrow at a sailing practice and I'm wondering:1) How do I bring this up to her? I know she will get very mad when she hears I snooped. Very mad.2) Do I wait until tomorrow when I see her and talk to her or do I call her mom or something now?I know that if I talk to her or her parents she will probably stop talking to me (Of course I will still talk to her or her parents).

While it's not fair to diagnose people on the web, I suspect that you're right about your friend.So what to do.   EDs are often a quite private disease.  Sure, others might get suspicious, and the situation can sometimes become obvious, but even then the sufferer ( for lack of a better word ) would rather keep their situation a secret. Because really,  other people just would not understand.  Or would just try and make them eat, or something like that.  I mean really, what possible benefit will come from having anyone else know ?  If they are still going for it, and see it as a positive thing, I mean.Some people do, and some people don't, even though folks with both attitudes are often still pushing forward.And as you said, if confronted directly, face-to-face, often the person's knee-jerk reaction is simply to deny everything.  If it were me, and I wanted to ask her about it, or wanted to convey my concern, I'd write her a letter. You have a feeling that she may have ""food issues"" and yet you realize that she may not want to talk about it.  You realize the situation may be difficult for her, but you still hope to be her friend.  What I mean is, try and put yourself in her shoes, and think about what might or might not feel OK to hear from a friend. You could contact her parents of course.  That would be responsible too. They might already know, to be honest.  But who knows. But like you said, you might also be able to help the situation by talking to her yourself. You guys are friends and that really does count for something too. But I'd use the letter approach to begin with.  That would give her time to think about what you said, and time for her to think about how to reply to you.  Rather than things just being impulsive if you talked face-to-face. But yeah, things like these are sensitive matters, and not always easy to confront.  And a whole lot of it will have to do with what her attitude is towards her ED right now.  Some people can still think the whole thing is great, while others can find themselves beginning to question things.PS, I just saw that your note was a few days old, and that you may already have had a chance to try and talk with her.  If so, how did it seem that things went ? Bob J.",cs777,"Sat,10/13/2018-12:56am","Hi.
I am a recovering from my earring disorder now after a very long and dangerous journey that has some parallels that you see in your friend. My advice is that you need to speak out and fast. I had no idea how much physical damage i had done to my body and if it had carried on longer my life was in very high danger. If you are worried about falling out with your friend don’t be. Her health is more important and if she gets angry just know this is the ed speaking not her and in time she will see that again. Try voicing your concerns and if she doesn’t agree to seeking help speak to her parents or adult who can help. For know if she doesn’t speak to you, you may have to deal with it but I promise she will be so grateful to u once she is in recovery. For the sake of her health please speak out as soon as you can as this (despite what her ed will make her say) is what she needs the most.

29,09/05/2018,Familymemberwithunsupportedparents,Cldwtr,"I recently learned that my cousin, who is 16, has been eating very little and counting calories and basically exhibiting all the symptoms of anorexia. She has struggled in the past with anxiety before and I believe shes getting help for that. The problem is, her parents do not take these issues as seriously as they should be. Her parents were aware that she was having problems for a long time but didn't act on it. Her parents are so embarrassed of her that they refuse to talk to anyone in the family about it, my older cousin who is an adult found out about her anxiety by chance, and she was the one who told me about it. My older cousin has been monitoring her as much as she can, and that how she found out about the anorexia, but there is only so much she can do. Talking to her parents doesn't seem to be an option because we are pretty sure her mothers obsession with her weight is what caused the anorexia in the first place. I'm extremely worried about my cousin but I'm just not sure what to do. Her family doesn't know that anyone else is aware of her eating disorder, and from what I know she refuses to talk to anyone about anything even related to it because she got angry when my older cousin brought up her anxiety. I'm not sure what I can do, I don't know how to bring it up without making her angry and I don't want her to put up a wall between us, as I'm the closest to her age in the family and probably the one she trusts the most. I've tried talking to the adults in my family and they are just not sure how they can help without the parents support. It's a difficult situation and I just don't know what to do but I can't just sit here and wait around like all the adults are doing and expecting it to get better, because I know it won't get better unless she get professional help.

I am glad that you have been concerned about your cousin and want to help her.  It does sound complicated as her parents don't seem too inclined to want to help which is a shame.  I know NEDA has some great people to talk with and they may be your best chance at getting some good advice on how to help her.  I know when I was sixteen and in the middle of my struggle with anorexia NO ONE was going to help me or tell me what to do.  I was FINE.  But that is the illness speaking and if that is where your cousin is, I understand her resistance in wanting any help.  Perhaps you can just let her know for now that you are there for her if she needs or wants to talk.  Make yourself available to her in a non threatening way.  Build up some trust and then maybe she may give you an opportunity to share your concerns.  Also maybe talk to a school guidance counselor.  Or another trusted adult.  As you know eating disorders are serious and usually only get worse unless there is some intervention.  I wish you the best and hope to hear from you about how things go..

I used to live in Sydney. Im a teen and so is my Gf. I suffer from bulimia.  I was a 2 minute walk away from my Gf who suffered from severe Anorexia. It was really hard for me at the time being the only person to know and not be able to do anything. One day she passed out and had a fit. Her mum came and picked her up and took her to the doctors. Even then I couldn't say anything as I had ""Promised not to"". Weeks went on and she was going 5 days at a time while purging like twice a day. I could tell I was loosing her.I finally told her mum and she took her to hospital. They admitted her that day. It turns out she was 3 days away from her heart failing. I nearly losed her.But anyways. She was dismissed and for a while was doing good (No eating disorder behaviors).Then my parents told me we were moving to Canberra.
