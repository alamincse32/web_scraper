0,10/06/2021,Howtoapproachandhelpfriend,"Hi there.
I have been friends with this girl for over 10 years and she moved in with a model during COVID.
Ever since she moved in with her new roommate, her eating habits have changed drastically along with her weight. She has had her struggles in the past with body image, but this feels like a lot different and honestly way worse.
She eats all of her food when she’s around me, snacks when i snack, asks for snacks/food, and will announce when she’s hungry, so I can’t assume she’s not eating.. (we are together almost everyday) but when we’ve gone grocery shopping in the past, she would only buy a few types of food. Her fridge is always empty when I’m over, and i never see her eating at home.
Recently she has been showing spiraling and high risk behaviors and blacks out constantly when she drinks. She endured a concussion recently & the doctor advised her to not drink, workout, or work and she did all of the above and pretended she never had one. She works out constantly, and if we eat something “fatty” she will instantly start doing jumping jacks in the living room, run around in circles, or try to go for a walk “to burn calories.” She has an Apple Watch and is obsessed with checking other peoples movements, and “closing out her rings.” We recently took a picture together and that’s when i really realized how tiny she has become as i could really see the bones in her upper body.

Our friends parents are constantly making comments about how skinny she is, and its very uncomfortable and all i want to do is help.. her family has the mentality of entitlement and denial.. so I’m unsure if going to them for help is going to hurt or actually help.
I care about my friend immensely, we have a tight group of girls and we all have noticed her behavior changes along with her incredible weight loss. ","Hi there.

1,08/12/2021,Idon'tknowhowtotalktomyfriendabouthisanorexia,"Um I just signed up on this website to do a forum and don't quite know how to really start in on this but I'm going to give it a try. So a guy in close to and recently dated at one point briefly brought up how he is anorexic. He doesn't share these personal things or topics with me often if at all (it's usually because I have to push him to tell me when I notice somethings wrong).  And I don't think he has really told anyone else about how he is anorexic. I'm just figuring out and researching anorexia but I don't know how to help him. He has had a troubled past with a lot of trauma and he doesn't seem depressed per se and would never self harm or harm anyone around him. However he very much has a mindset of ""if I get help from someone then I am weak and I must be strong"". So I don't know how to help or talk with him on the matter of his anorexia among other things if he doesn't want help. He has a lot of stress in his life right now too with school and the fact that his mom might have cancer so he will need to help pay bills for it. He also isn't big on talking about himself or personal things unless you push him and even then he doesn't always open up. Aside from that I realized that he smokes Marijuana as a form of self medicating his trauma especially so he can get through his day and night. But I've read that it can be the cause of not eating or not getting good sleep, is that true? And if so would it be safe for him to stop using Marijuana when he uses it as a crutch? And is there any reccomendations on how to help him without him feeling like he is weak? I really care about him and want to help, I know he also wouldn't be okay or feel comfortable talking to a therapist or professional about it nor do I know how serious his anorexia is yet.","Yep, the worries about ""being weak"" can be a concern alright.

2,07/25/2021,Helpingafriendfiguringoutifhehasaneatingdisorder,"My friend (male 20) thinks he has an eating disorder. I am not sure it is one but I would like to help him as much as possible. He has said that he hasn’t felt like eating “because it is not fun” for a few weeks now. Today he texted me that he was trying to eat and after a few bites he felt like he was going to throw up so he had to stop eating. He said the taste had made him feel that way and it has been happening for over a week. This current meal he was actually excited about which hasn’t happened in a while so now he is concerned.
He is a bigger guy even for his height so he’s always eaten a lot but his intake has diminished because of his lack of wanting to eat. Is this why he feels gross when eating?
Is this an eating disorder and if it is how can I help him to make sure he is eating and taking care of himself?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,03/28/2021,ShouldIInformHerParents?,"Okay, I'll try to keep this brief. So, recently I noticed that my best friend was starting to get thinner. In hindsight, I hate that I commented on it to begin with, since that probably just fueled her determination to harm herself. But, I digress. I asked her what she was doing, and she seemed kind of hesitant to answer at first. Then she said that she was just cutting out snacks. In my mind, I just figured that she was cutting back on overeating, which I thought was a good, healthy step. Fast forward, and then I realized she wasn't bringing lunch to school (she packs), and then I realized I couldn't remember the last time she brought lunch to school. I know she doesn't eat breakfast, so now without eating lunch, I put two and two together and realized her method of getting 'healthy' is by forcing herself to not eat.
I tried talking to her about it recently and sat her down and addressed the situation. Her response was that she was fine and I was overanalyzing the situation. I even asked her what she had been eating recently, and she refused to tell me when the last time she had a full meal was. Her excuse is that she's not hungry. So then I packed her lunch for school and gave it to her (I said she left it in my car so no one would think I actually made her lunch). I don't know if she ate it or not, because I found out that she likes to lie to me so I won't worry.
I told her that if she doesn't talk to her parents about getting help that I will. However, I think she lied to me about actually doing that. I know I'm not a doctor, but what she's doing is all in line with an eating disorder. Especially since the two times we hung out with our other friends, she was fine until food was placed in front of her. Her hands would shake as she held the food in her hands and she looked really withdrawn and ill.
Now, her cousin just died from COVID and I don't know if it would be inappropriate to reach out to her mom and tell her that she isn't eating. Her mom's been praising her appearance lately too, which, to me, demonstrates that she didn't actually tell her mom what she's been doing. I mean, what parent would comment that after finding out their child hasn't been eating? ","Okay, I'll try to keep this brief. So, recently I noticed that my best friend was starting to get thinner.

It's can be pretty amazing sometimes, how people don't see things which are right in front of their eyes.

4,02/26/2021,CanIGetSomeAdvice,"So I met this girl online and after a little while of talking to her she admitted to having an eating disorder to me, this is something new for me and while I did my best to support her as much as possible until the other day when I made a huge mistake, I did not know that her situation was currently as bad as it was in the past. But as we were talking she went to go eat breakfast and when she came back all she had was some nuts, later on in the day she was hungry so naturally I told her it was okay to go get some food, she refused and then insisted she wasn't hungry anymore, and then I said one of the worst things possible, I said ""the nuts didn't fill you up."" I realize I made a huge mistake and owned up to this and now after talking to her for about 8 months she wants nothing to do with me. For her this is a big deal because she's had negative comments from her friends and family before and I knew that. Is there anything I can do to help fix the situation or support her going forward. I feel terrible and I always had the best intentions but something I said as a joke ruined everything and I didn't even think about her eating disorder when I made this comment. If I had just thought about what I said before I said it, I wouldn't be in this situation. But I can't take back what I said and I own up to my actions. I just would like some advice if anybody has been in a situation like this or if you've been a victim of negative comments.","Hi shawn7851, Welcome to the forums.

5,12/08/2020,WorriedBestFriend,"Hi there,
I've been growing increasingly nervous around one of my best friends. Over the summer I had noticed her losing some weight, and exercising more, which I thought was her just trying to get healthier at first, but recently, it's become noticeably much. Another friend came up to me as well and asked if she was alright. I guess because I'm around her so often it wasn't exactly clear how thin she had become until I had taken a step back and really looked at her. Recently she started an instagram page that was all about food, and I saw her in our free time scrolling through pages of meals, which I didn't think was weird until I realized that I never really see her eat much of the meals that she makes. This was around the same time she started to get quite thin as well. When we go out to eat, or she comes over for a long period of time, I will rarely see her eat, she never says she's hungry, and she will always reject food when I offer her some unless it's a set lunch or dinner that she has previously agreed to. She used to get excited over food and other activities, but has grown quiet and reserved, and maybe just less enthusiastic overall and now I am mainly the one to initiate meals. I have been friends with her for nearly 10 years, and am wondering if I should just ask her if she is alright and make sure to clarify to her why I am asking? You'd think I'd be more comfortable checking in on such a close friend but I am really scared, because I just want to help her more than anything and I guess I am asking for confirmation that I should at least try.","I think you have every right to be concerned.

8,11/03/2020,CanIhelpanAcquaintancewithED?,"Hi, my best friend's brother has been showing signs of an ED for quite some time now but I've never known if I should do or say anything because we are not very close. I live 3 hours away so I don't see him often and we rarely chat or anything like that. I heard from my mom that he's reached out and is presumably going to receive help for his ED. The thing is, he is a part of a family that all have toxic relationships with food and they praised him when he began suddenly losing a dangerous amount of weight, so his recovery will likely be extremely hard on him, if he even is able to. I'm afraid he won't be able to recover in his environment but I don't know if I'm even capable of supporting him because we rarely speak. Is there anything I can do? And is it even in my place to say anything? I'm afraid for his health but I'm really not sure if it's any of my business.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Educating herself is a good start, but I'm not sure that that needs to be your job to be her teacher,, so as mentioned above, she might want to check around and see what sort of resources there are that can help her get a better idea of what you are going though. For a start, that is.","Hey Anne,It's brave of you to want your friend to help support you.

So maybe she can help you do just normal sorts of things, like going on hikes and things like that, which can help people's minds not stay stuck in those ED thoughts all the time ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,09/14/2020,Adulthidingpossiblebulimia,"We are both women in our mid-late 30s and single, living alone. One of my good friends LOVES certain food, all the good food. Yet - I'm pretty sure she's puking it all up. She makes fun of people that ""just eat foods that are labeled as healthy"" and supports anyone eating what they want. On the outside, very body positive. On the inside, I know she struggles and gets pressure from her family. I've heard her puking on multiple occasions in the bathroom and have seen evidence in the toilet in other times. We've been friends for years but I've never said anything. I'm not sure how to tackle this. I know she has a therapist but also know that she's pretty secretive, so not sure if this even comes up in therapy. Is this something I should confront? I feel like it will hurt our friendship if I do. How can I let a friend know that I'm concerned and try and get her to confide in me?","Hi.

11,07/24/2020,Concernedaboutsomepeople-adviceonhowtohelp,"I've noticed that over lockdown (and some time before) a few people I know have become increasingly obsessed with their body image, food intake etc. and I have no idea how to help as a friend. I'm speaking regularly with a couple of them and have praised them for opening up to me about it and encouraged them to seek professional help. Both their parents are also less than supportive - they actually encourage their behaviour- so I'm not sure whether they will be able to get any help at all. I don't want to trigger or offend them in any way so sometimes I don't know what to say.  I know from experience the 'just eat' type of comments really don't make anyone feel better so I've avoided things like that.

13,06/01/2020,Myfriendkeepsmakingexcusesinsteadofgettinghelp,My best friend has been struggling with an eating disorder for many years and this past year it has gotten so bad that she is frequently in the hospital with severe life threatening issues with problems caused by it. She trusts me enough to talk to me about her problems and I listen and help her however I can. I tried talking to the doctors at the hospital about helping her but they couldn’t do anything on my word alone apparently. I am very worried I could lose her. I’ve talked with her parents and I’ve tried talking with her doctors but they cannot force her to get help. She is scared to get help and keeps making excuses not to see a doctor or a therapist. I’m not sure what I can do but I do not want to be helpless.,"Boy, this is a difficult position to be in, but I think a lot of other people are in your shoes.

It is so kind of you to reach out to try to find help for your friend. I know it is scary to see what is happening with friend. I can only give you my opinion as we can't give medical advice. As she is so young and the reality that eating disorders are dangerous and life threatening, I would try seeing if you can talk with who you trust or even her parents.  This may cause your friend to become angry but from what you are describing, your friend needs help now.  If she does get angry, the face t that you are helping her get help since she is unable to do so is actually the bravest thing you could do for her.  She will probably come around and thank you but right now the important thing is for your friend to get help.

I know it is scary to see what is happening with friend. I can only give you my opinion as we can't give medical advice.

This may cause your friend to become angry but from what you are describing, your friend needs help now.

15,04/04/2020,MultipleFriendswithE.Ds,"Hi! Two of my best friends have eating disorders, one of them going to the doctors for it. I have done my research & I know the signs & indicators. Whenever me & my two best friends ever converse, whether that be in real life, or on text, little signs of insecurity & unsure-ness shines though in their sentences to each other and me. whenever this happens, I never know what to say other than denying it, & when I do this, it feels like it does nothing. So what I'm asking for advice on is: what could I say or do that could actually be useful in situations like this, especially because I have not been though or supported somebody with an eating disorder?","First off, I'm sorry your post sat here for a while unanswered.

16,03/11/2020,Howtoguidefriendsinsupport?,"I'm currently fighting for recovery, and have been gradually opening up to one of my best friends, with a changing dynamic between us (we both like each other more than friends). He can be a little cold when I talk about my ED and my negative thoughts. He's the sort of person who doesn't like to beat around the bush and be straight to the point, but I receive it as cold-hearted and unsympathetic a lot of the time. I want to help him understand what I need to best support me, but I'm not sure exactly what to tell him. I also really want to open up to my friends more, but it just feels like they can't understand. Is there anyone that can give advice or talk about their experience? I'm still trying to navigate what it takes to recover and how to change almost a lifetime of self-negativity. Anything you can do to help me help my friends to better understand would be greatly appreciated.","Hey Lost,","Hey Lost,You know, I think it's really hard for people without experience to understand EDs.

17,01/30/2020,Concernedaboutafriend,"My very close friend has been struggling with a few things in her life and has gone through a lot more than a 19 year old girl should ever have to go through. This year she took a second gap year before going to university, planned to travel yet seems to have let all those travel dreams fade and has no interest in it any more. She is not happy with her job and isolates herself. I try and make plans with her and she will either say that she will do x with me such as go for drinks, go for a walk, just chill and hangout but then she will cancel last minute or she will not respond to me until it is too late to do anything. Other times she wont answer me, and she never seems to reach out to me anymore to make plans. It worries me because she is isolating herself completely from friends, she did tell me she was taking time but I don't think that it is healthy to isolate yourslef for months. I understand she wants time for herself and I am not mad that she won't spend time with me, I am just concerned. She works out a lot too, and besides going to the gym and work she doesnt leave her house really unless she is running errands. Her younger sister reached out to me on because she is worried for her sister/my friend as she has notices she is very mad all the time, asks her/her dad for money weekly (avg $50), she hides out in her room in the basement, and jsut doesnt seem herself. And then the sister sent me a video of all the garbage from foods which she has hid in her cold cellar downstairs. Her sister says she sneaks the food in through the side door, and has heard her throwing up a few times, but she is also not home all the time because she is in school and at extra curriculars. Her sister says she will eat a bunch of these foods and then hide it in bags and throw it up. She has been vegan for quite some time, partialy for dietary purposes, so a lot of the food she has hidden is not vegan. She also doesnt eat when at work, which is from 9-5 (I worked with her this summer so I just noticed it). I saw her today as I ran into her at the grocery store and in her basket (I didnt observe too much because i didnt want to make her feel any more uncomfortable) but she had ice cream cones and chip bags, and more under that I didnt get a look at. I could tell she felt super uncomfortable and she hid the basket, so i kept it short and left. I just dont know what to do because I dont know for sure that she has an eating disorder, but i am really concerned as she is not acting like herslef and is shutting people out. When I saw her I noticed she has broken out in acne on her face and her face is quite puffy. I want to support her so badly because we are so close and I also miss spending time with her. I just don't know how to go about any of this in a way that won't upset her, or she lose trust in me.","I'm so sorry to hear about your friend !   But really, if you are on sites for people with eating disorders, you'll often hear them complain about everything that you've mentioned.

I met her in a yoga class about eight years ago and did not observe/connect until spring 2019 when I learned she was in hospital. (when I became her health care proxy). Divorced and long-estranged from only family, a brother who lives thousands of miles away, has been isolating for years (apart from this particular yoga class which no longer exists). She does not admit to an eating disorder while in last 6 months her weight has dropped significantly. Won’t consent to in-patient (or out-patient) program. What is available in this upstate NY area is not great anyway.  She has some cognitive issues and may be slipping towards dementia.
Her primary doctor of many years and the eating disorders physician at local hospital don’t seem to have a plan, but just encourage her to gain weight. (I know because my friend no longer drives and I bring her to doctor visits). I contacted a psychotherapist who said therapy would not work with her brain so malnourished.  Looking for suggestions. Thanks.","This sounds like a difficult matter alright.  While you friend clearly has an issue, if she refuses to see it as a problem, I don't think there is much that anyone can do to make her gain weight voluntarily.  If she had some sort of clear medical issue that was weight related which threatened her life, perhaps she could be hospitalized for that.  But that she is simply thin apparently by choice, and getting thinner;  I'm not sure that the medical community would hospitalize someone against their will for a matter like that.

But that she is simply thin apparently by choice, and getting thinner;  I'm not sure that the medical community would hospitalize someone against their will for a matter like that. However, you did mention that she was isolating herself, and if you are friends enough with her to actually want to spend time with her, you could play a positive role as far as helping her stay connected to the outside world is concerned.  Just by spending time with her, and perhaps the two of you doing some activities that keep her engaged in some of the more stimulating aspects of normal life.Eating disorders among older individuals is more common that most people realize, so what you are seeing in her is probably less out of the ordinary than it may seem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though I had seen some of her restricting behaviors towards food, I felt guilty as her best friend for not noticing sooner.

Again, I’m the only one who knows about her struggles and she doesn’t feel like she can talk to anyone else about them. I know this isn’t about me, but I’m freaking out. It’s the number one thing on my mind everyday, and I just don’t know what to do. If anyone has any advice of how I can support her, I would be so grateful. I know I can’t fix her but I want to make sure I’m doing the most I can.  I’m really worried about her health and I just don’t know what else to do.  Thank you so much.","Hi.  I am sorry to hear about your friend, but am thankful for your concern.  I would first of all suggest that you contact NEDA and ask them for help and support.  They would be able to help you figure out what to do to help your friend.  I know when I was in school, my friend told my therapist about something life threatening that I did.  I was not angry with her and when she told me she told my therapist we both went together to talk with her and I did wind up going to a hospital.","Hi.

I was not angry with her and when she told me she told my therapist we both went together to talk with her and I did wind up going to a hospital.If you are this concerned about your friend, is it possible to tell her how concerned you are? Do you know her parents?  Are they involved in her life?  Being that I don't know you and we are really not allowed to offer advice, but share experiences and offer support, I will do that.  I also want to make sure you are okay and that you don't feel responsible for your friends choices.  It is difficult I know, but she needs professional help.  Maybe the two of you can contact NEDA together and get help and or referrals for a therapist for your friend.  That way you aren't going behind her back and at the same time can get help for yourself.  On the web site for NEDA there are tool kits for family and friends to help you know what to do and or say.  That might be helpful for you.  It is a difficult place to be when you care about someone a lot as you do, but to not get in over your head.  You can not stop your friend from using any type of behavior but you can be there to support her.  Again, I am concerned for you as she is responsible for herself and you are responsible for you.  That may seem harsh but if you take on her responsibility you are going to not be able to help your friend.  It is similar to when someone is drowning.  The friend wants to help the person drowning, so they go out to rescue the person who is drowning, but what happens is the person drowning brings down the rescuer and both wind up drowning.  If the other person is equipped and knows how to save someone, then a rescue can take place.
This may sound terrible, but it is true.  In order to help your friend, you need to be in a place where you are equipped.  Calling NEDA may help you with that and they can further assist you in what to do next.
I am sorry I was unable to offer anything better than this.  Eating disorders are life threatening and serious.  If your friend is as bad off as you are saying, please let someone know who can help her get help.  Thank you for caring about your friend.  I do not say all of this to discourage you but to say that while it is good that you are supporting your friend, she may need more than what you can give her.
Please, let us know how the both of you are doing.  You are both important.  I say all I did with care and concern, not to frighten you away.  ","Hi.

First of all, I really really appreciate that you're looking out for me. Everything you said makes total sense. I am working on trying to take better care of myself through all of this. I am planning on talking to my own therapist next week.
As for my friend, she keeps emphasizing that she is very scared to tell someone, because she's worried about what people will think, but also is nervous to give all of this up.  Her relationship with her parents is not in a place where she feels like she can talk to them about it. I feel like my biggest role is to help her get help and just be there, I just want to make sure I'm doing the most I can.
I wish I could give more specifics, but the last thing I want to do is have my friend's identity be traceable in anyway. But if it helps, we are both in college.

I just wanted to update/maybe get some more advice if possible. My friend is still suffering a lot and doesn’t want to go to counseling because her family doesn’t believe in it. I totally get that, but I really think she needs professional help so I’m really not sure what to do. What is the best way of approaching this?
On the other hand, I’m still the only one who knows and I’m really really struggling in carrying all of this all by myself. I want to be there for my friend and the last thing I want is for her to feel like I can’t be there for her. (I haven’t expressed to her how hard it is for me) It’s just been a lot for me to carry on my own and I don’t really know what to do about that. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to handle all of this?? My friend’s well being is my top priority, because I know that she I suffering a lot more than I am, but I’m just struggling a lot.

I encourage you to go with your heart regarding your friend. I don't want you to live with regret if someone happens to her. You love her. I know. I hope you are able to let someone know she needs help.  Again,  the NEDA helpline can help you further. Take care of yourself. iwanttolive","Iwanttolive-
Again thank you SO MUCH for your thoughtful response. I promise I’m working on taking caring of myself as well, I think I’m just overwhelmed. Your post definitely is helping me understand that I really need to take care of myself if I want to take care of my friend. Thank you for your care for others- it does not go unnoticed or unappreciated. I hope the best for you and your loved ones. I appreciate you so much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,01/11/2020,Roomie/BFFwithBingeEatingDisorder,"Hello! My name is Emma & I am in college. My best friend, who is also my roomie has been struggling with binge eating disorder for a very long time. For the time I’ve known her she has gone through up and down cycles. Sometimes she will go without binging for some time, but just when I think she is starting to recover and make progress she binges. Her binges have been getting consistently worse everytime recently to the point where she will eat until she passes out and it last for days. I have tried to help in many ways. I have been supportive, understanding and patient. I am getting frustrating though because she has stolen food from me multiple times. We have set boundaries, but she has broken them. I am torn apart and am not sure what to do because she is my best friend. I want to be supportive and understanding still but I am getting to a breaking point. Please help me, I have no idea what to do.","Hi Itseemmmmaa - you mentioned some concerning symptoms in your post, and we wanted to affirm that this is a sign for which your friend may need to seek medical attention. The following are just some of the signs of a serious problem that demands immediate medical attention:

 Please do not hesitate to call the NEDA helpline at 1-800-931-2237 (Monday-Thursday 9:00am-9:00pm, Friday 9:00am-5:00pm EST) if you need help finding resources to help support your friend. Please take care.","Hi.   I am sorry for your situation and for your friends struggle.  Is it possible to get help through the counselling services at your college?  Many campuses have counselling centers.  You may want to go for yourself first and then let your friend know about them.   Also, NEDA has a lot of information on their web site on how to help someone you love, be it a friend or family member.  You can also call them or chat with them online.  If your friend is indeed passed out, it may be very important to call 911 or the nurse on campus.  I wouldn't worry so much about if she will be mad at you if you are saving her life.  It appears that she needs help but is not aware of it or is afraid of it or doesn't want to get help.  But it isn't your job to jeep your friend from hurting herself in this way.  As difficult as this sounds, it is her responsibility, but you can get her help if she is in danger.  If her life is in danger.  If she is passed out.  Eating disorders are life threatening.  They are very serious and without help usually get worse.  Please take care of yourself and know you can not control what your friend does or doesn't do.  I know it is scary.  I can see you love your friend.  Please let us know how you are and how your friend is doing.","Hi.   I am sorry for your situation and for your friends struggle.

22,12/27/2019,Notsurewhattodoatthispoint,"My friend has anorexia, and has been struggling for awhile. I recommended her to NEDA. She didn't even try. I asked her to look into a support group's website. She didn't visit it. She claims she's getting better, but I hear her every time she says ""I'm so fat.."" and I see her every time she refuses lunch. She won't go to a therapist. And..she seems to think I don't care because I don't talk to her about it. But in actuality, I care so deeply about her health (hence why I'm on this platform) and didn't want to do or say anything that could have the wrong effect. I'm sort of a perfectionist and don't wanna screw this up. I feel so helpless.
       Sincerely, Me
Any advice or suggestions are welcome","Hi.  I am sorry for your friend's inability to get, receive or see that she needs help, or just is not able to cope with it.  There is a parent's tool kit that helps friends and family or parent's know how and or what to say to help a loved one dealing with an eating disorder.  And on Monday you can call or chat with a trained volunteer about your situation.  For now, sometimes saying anything can be taken the wrong way with someone who is struggling with an eating disorder.  So I think you are on the right track when you don't ""feed"" into your friends obsession.   You might want to say that you are concerned for her and will listen if you are able to at this point, but you won't comment on her weight or appearance as it won't help her.  It sounds as though you figured this out.   It is important that you take care of yourself and if you are feeling in over your head you may want to consider getting some help for yourself in dealing with this.  It is very difficult and scary and you shouldn't be the only one involved in helping your friend.  It is too much in my opinion for one person to shoulder the responsibility.  It is really your friends decision if she gets help or doesn't.  Sometimes people are too sick to realize they need help and that is when others need to get involved even when the other person doesn't want that.  Eating disorders are dangerous and life threatening so if you feel your friend is at that point, you may want to let someone know of your concerns.  Unfortunately if she is over eighteen, no one can force her against her will to get help.  That is the tragic thing.  Fear plays a big role in why people don't get help.  It is scary.  There is so much wrapped up in change.
As for you, please take care of yourself and if you need help, don't be afraid to ask for it.","Hi.

I am wondering if they know that you know that they have an eating disorder?  That would be helpful when trying to talk with them about it.  If so, maybe you can just share that you are concerned for them and want them to know that they can talk with you anytime if they want to.  It is important to not focus on food or behaviors so much but to offer a listening ear.
If they don't know that you know about the eating disorder, that may be a little more challenging.  Does your friend talk about feelings openly or are they secretive.  People who have an eating disorder may try to protect it as it acts as a safety net and makes talking about it difficult because that is a way of coping for them.

We'll be going home for thanksgiving break this weekend and I'm wondering if I should let them know to be on the lookout for any changes in the way she eats compared to the way she ate before coming off to college. Will she continue her patterns of eating inadequately or eat enough now that she has a variety of comforting food at her exposure?I don't want to ruin our friendship over my possible overreacting, so I want to be very careful about who I tell and the way I tell it. While we're best friends, it can be hard for her to be vulnerable with me and I don't want to ruin the little bit of vulnerability and lose her trust in me because I told her parents or accused her of something that isn't as big of a deal as I built it up to be.","I've been rooming with my best friend this first semester of college and I've noticed some behaviors that may be indicative of an eating disorder. I'm worried I may have provoked it. I'm also wondering if I should talk to her parents. I'll start with a back story.We've been close friends since seventh grade and while she never overindulged, she seemed to eat an adequate amount of calories while she was under her parents roof.  You can probably tell by this description that she's a picky eater, and that hasn't changed... now it just seems that she eats much less. I've heard a lot of ""I'm just not hungry""s and ""I'm tired of the food on campus."" But we have some of the highest ranking on campus dining in America. Even I, as a vegan, haven't gotten sick of the food because we have SO MANY OPTIONS. Which brings me to my next point...Even though I eat in abundance, my diet is restrictive by definition, and I'm hoping my choice to follow this lifestyle isn't causing her to change the way she eats. While I would love to see people stop eating animals, they need to replace it with healthy whole foods, not nothing. Could this be because when people ask me why I'm vegan, one of my answers is that the agricultural industry is bad for the environment? I want to give people an honest answer, and I think they deserve to know the truth, but if this could be causing her to struggle with what she eats I don't want that.We also have a suite mate who has struggled with eating disorders, and still lives with one. Even though she now eats a very balanced diet and gets a proper amount of calories everyday, she still talks a lot about the amount of calories in everything she eats, and occasionally over-exercises, which could be triggering to my roommate. I'm not sure. Either way, even she has expressed concerns to me about my roommate potentially having an ED.I make many efforts to encourage her to eat such as being intentional about going to meals with her (while this usually works, I like to do spiritual fasts and I also just have my own schedule sometimes, during these times that I don't ask her to get food with me she usually just won't get it at all). I don't want to completely jump to conclusions. She doesn't show many of the typical signs of an ED such as counting calories, excessive exercise, eating healthy, low cal foods, or body checking. The only thing I have noticed is that she simply doesn't eat enough food. She is a picky eater. She really could be telling the truth when she says she's sick of the food here.

26,11/17/2019,Anyoneelsebeenfooledforalongtimebysomeonewithaeatingdisorder,"My friend has a eating disorder. She lives in another province so I don’t seen her often but I can now tell that She’s been suffering for years and I didn’t even notice. She’s always gone threw great lengths to hid it... and hid it well. I feel like a terrible person for not noticing, like maybe I was to self envolved to see what was right in from of me. She’s been suffering seizures for years that she said Dr. Didn’t know what was causing it and I believed her. Everytime I would see or talk to her in seemed that the doctors had a differently theory., and again, I believe her everytime But recently I’ve realized that she’s been having seizures because she’s so emaciated. And I feel stupid, has something like this happened to anyone else? When I look back (I’ve knows her since childhood) I feel like I should of known from this start as she’s showed signs of a eating disorder since childhood. I’ve tried to talk to her about this and she’s completely shut me out. There have been time when she’s been close to death in the hospital and none of her extended family or friends know (her and her parents are extremely secretive about her mysteries health oroblems) which of course is her eating Disorder. I still can’t belive if took me this long to figure it out. Has this happened to anyone else. I just wish I had noticed sooner and tried to help her.","Hey Jennie,","Hey Jennie,Yes, people with eating disorders often want to hide their situation.

Keep in touch ?","BobJ48,
I fear that you are correct in the sense of her wanting to ""fulfill the criterion"" for the diagnosis, which is truly scary. And I've tried my best to be supportive of her since I first recognized her ED, but what scares me the most, is that I used to try different diets with her. I used to do a lot of digging on the internet for good diets, and I always shared them with her and so we tried them together. That sounds normal, but what scares me about it is that she justifies every restriction, every pound lost, and every meal skipped by saying ""oh it's a new diet"" or ""I'm fasting"".. She also has depression, which has seemed to get less severe after she started going out with her current boyfriend, but it doesn't seem like she's gonna tell him about the ED which could mean her depression coming bak in full force if she starts feeling lonely in her struggle.
     Every time I try to reach out to her and talk about it, she's all of the sudden busy, or needs to go talk to people nearest to us. She has decided that (even though she's been diagnosed) she's fine, and that she still needs to be much thinner.  I've never really had an ED myself, but I have depression and even though that's one way to sympathize with her, I can't really empathize with her. And I imagine it's making her feel lonely too. She's been denying treatment, and won't talk to us about it, but knowing her, when this is done and through with, she's gonna say that she wished she reached out sooner.
     I don't know how to empathize with her, or talk to her about it calmly without offending her or sounding intrusive. And I feel so..helpless. I really don't know how I can reach out to her anymore..

After thorough research, I would randomly say something about a ""new diet"" that safely helps lose weight (even though they didn't really) and would glorify the diets, and tried to convince her to try them with me. After awhile, she had started eating new and different foods with me in different ways than normal, and she looked healthier. But the tricky part about this is that by pretending not to care, you have to make sure to still spend time with them, just never talk about the ED. Make sure to make lots of plans with them, and ALWAYS have food as an option with your plans. a good trick is anytime there is a new restaurant, take them there and tell them y'all have to try the food there cuz it's supposed to be really good. This works for her, and I'm not sure if it works for you. Also, be careful that she doesn't start to think that you are ignoring her problem. If she ever asks, just say that you felt like you didn't know how to help but that you hated seeing them like that. Yes, It's a bit of a guilt trip, but it makes them stop and think about how they're affecting everyone else.","I have a friend currency doing the exact same thing.

We met freshman year of college and were best friends all through school. Truly, she was and still is one of my very best friends. I knew she had a problem when I first met her and she eventually opened up and spilled everything to me sophomore year. Her behaviors are feeling compelled to over-exercise, strict rules about what foods she can eat when, and I have known her to occasionally binge/not be in control of how much she eats in one sitting. I think a lot of this was originally caused by her parents, who expect perfection out of her and can be really irrational/cruel. To complicate things, she also has a medical condition that can cause her to gain lots of weight quickly when she becomes stressed out. When this happens, she gets really depressed and is unable to lose weight through exercise or restricting food. All that to say: she has moments when she is honest about what’s happening, but her baseline is to deny that anything is wrong/downplay the seriousness of things.","Thank you so much in advance to anyone who reads all of this and can offer guidance.I’m going to be sharing an apartment with one of my best friends this year (moving in one week) who has a long history of ED.Some context: I’ve known this friend for almost 10 years.

30,07/12/2019,12yearoldniece,"I have a 12 year old niece with an eating disorder, I'm sure, but I don't think my sister is being as concerned as she should be. My niece just saw pediatrician yesterday, her weight has gone down in comparison to 3 months ago, according to whatever height/weight scale they use. Doctor checked her heart,and is sending her to dietician,may be within eating disorder clinic. I believe my niece plays a good game,food group avoidance, oh I'm not hungry, oh I forgot to eat, oh I already had a snack,oh my tummy hurts,whilst wanting go go for walks,swims,get activity. I think it's all food avoidance type game for her with excuses that my sister either believes and/or makes excuses for,and my sister believes she can reason with her about eating and it will all get better,and my sister always thinks she knows best for her daughter and SHE can fix all. I don't know how to help and be there for my niece, my sister is very over protective too, so it's hard to be there for her. What can I say to my niece heart to heart? How can I best support my niece and my difficult sister?","Hi.  I am sorry to hear about your niece.  I know it can be frustrating when you want to help someone in your family but are stopped by family.  My guess is that if she does go to the dietician, they will know more fully what is going on with your niece and won't be fooled by her excuses.  They may be able to help your sister understand what is going on.  If you just want to reach out to your niece and let her know you are there for her if she ever wants to talk, it may open up the door down the road for her to open up to you about her eating difficulties. Right now it sounds like she is not open to any kind of help, but if you let her know you are there for her if she needs to talk, it may be a good place to start.  Do you live nearby?  Can you take her someplace she likes and you can have some privacy to talk?  It is very kind and caring of you to be concerned and to want to help your niece.  That is wonderful.  I hope she gets the help she needs as the earlier this is caught the better chances for recovery.  Keep in touch and let us know how things are going.","Hi.  I am sorry to hear about your niece.

31,03/12/2019,SupportingmyBestFriend,"Hi all,","Hi all,My best friend and roommate has been suffering from bulimia for a number of years. We have honest and open discussions about it and she's currently in counselling and going to ED specific group therapy. ","Hi all,My best friend and roommate has been suffering from bulimia for a number of years. We have honest and open discussions about it and she's currently in counselling and going to ED specific group therapy. My question is, outside of encouraging her to continue with therapy, how can I be as supportive as possible? I don't know if I should be pointing out things like bruising on her legs or how I rarely ever see her eat a meal. I'm one of the only friends she feels comfortable with talking candidly about her ED and I don't want to say the wrong thing or accidentally push her away. I try to encourage/remind her to eat and I make sure to never make comments about my own body in front of her. I honestly just feel scared that I'm going to say something wrong and do more damage than good. I want more than anything for her to love herself and regain some control over her eating. ","Hi all,My best friend and roommate has been suffering from bulimia for a number of years. We have honest and open discussions about it and she's currently in counselling and going to ED specific group therapy. My question is, outside of encouraging her to continue with therapy, how can I be as supportive as possible? I don't know if I should be pointing out things like bruising on her legs or how I rarely ever see her eat a meal. I'm one of the only friends she feels comfortable with talking candidly about her ED and I don't want to say the wrong thing or accidentally push her away.

I honestly just feel scared that I'm going to say something wrong and do more damage than good. I want more than anything for her to love herself and regain some control over her eating. Any help is appreciated <3","Hi and welcome to the forum.  I am glad to hear you are supporting your friend.  It can be very scary to see someone you love and care about suffer and not know what to do.  My best suggestion is to ask your friend how she wants you to be a support to her.  Making sure she is eating and encouraging her to eat may or may not be the most helpful thing for her.  She knows she needs to eat.  I would share with her your concerns that you don't want to say the wrong thing and are afraid of pushing her away.  I would be honest about your concerns and then leave it up to her to tell you what she feels she wants and needs from you.  Sometimes just listening and her knowing that you are there for her means a lot.  If it seems that she is in danger or there is an emergency, I would tell her that you are concerned and that you need to let someone in authority at the campus know or if you are not living on campus, then you may need to call 911.  She may be angry but if it is an emergency, it is more important to help her this way and deal with the anger at a later time. But for now, you are doing a great job at caring for her and being there for her.  I know it can be difficult.  Again, ask her what she needs and wants.  Let her know of your fears of saying the wrong thing and pushing her away.  That way you aren't so worried all the time and be stressed yourself while you need to be focused on your studies and other things as well.  I hope this helps.  Take care and post anytime.

Rather than us inquiring about the person's ED behaviors.Also, people in her situation can often find themselves full of self-doubt and self-hate. That really can be one of the worst mental aspects of eating disorders, and you may have already heard her make comments about herself like that.  So one other practical thing you can do, is when you see an opportunity, point out the goodness you see in her. Not just generalities like ""Oh, I know you to be a good person"" but be specific.  Has she made caring comments about others, or about how things should be better in the world ?  People who actually are hateful would never think to care about things like that.  So comments like : ""It shows what a good-heated person you are, that you would care about that."" are things that can help her gain a less hateful perspective on herself.","I love my friend so much and I feel so ignorant not realizing that she has been having problems with food up until recently, and I really want to make her feel better but I don't know how. shes average weight but she's been eating a lot less in the last few months because she feels really insecure, but after eating some small yogurt or something along those lines she feels absolutely terrible for eating and feels so much guilt and I just want her to get better but I don't know how.
She understands what she's doing isn't healthy but she cant stop herself.","Dear idk,","Dear idk,First off, I hope you won't be too hard on yourself for not being more aware of her eating issues.

I am glad you posted and that you care so much for your friend.  Eating disorders are very complex and difficult to deal with, for all involved.  It is a difficult situation to be in when your friend told you what is going on but then to tell you not to be involved.  Well, she got you involved.  It will be more difficult now for you to not want to know how she is doing.  Recovering from bulimia or any eating disorder is very difficult when trying to recover on one's own.  It is really important to get a therapist and a medical doctor involved as bulimia is very dangerous and can be life threatening.  I do not mean to scare you by saying this, but even if one is only suffering for a short while a lot of things can go wrong and it is really important that she get checked out by a medical doctor.  I do not know if she would be open to this.  I think it would be okay to voice your concerns once more and to ask her if she would be willing to be checked out by a doctor, have lab work done, to make sure all is okay.  The doctor would need to know of the bulimia and from what it sounds like, she may not be inclined to go.  Otherwise I would just let her know that you are there for her and that you want to support her, but you need to keep in mind that you are not and can not be her therapist.  That is unfair of her to expect that of you and not good for her as she needs professional help.  But if she wants to talk and you want to listen, that is being supportive.  If you sense that she needs more, I would tell her that you are uncomfortable and feel she needs more help than you are able to give her.  It is a very difficult situation.  Most of the time, unless someone wants the help, or to get better, no one can force them.  No one can stop them from purging of binging or restricting.  The person has to want the help  and then it is difficult even then.  So thank you for caring enough about your friend to post here.  Also, you may want to call NEDA or chat with them to see what their input is.  I hope this was helpful.  Post anytime and let us know how things are going.  ","Hello and welcome to the forum.

34,03/14/2019,FriendinNeed,"My friend has a disorder that's similar, but unlike any of the other disorders that I've seen on the internet so far.

The only times I've been able to get him to eat with me is buying going out and getting fast food. I worry that he is not getting enough nutrition. Because he is not eating enough he is also very skinny and gets weak very easily.

It met with resistance so just wondering what next!","Hi, Welcome to the forum.  I am encouraged to hear how much you care about your friend.  And that you spent time on the forum to see how others have dealt with similar situations.  How is your sister doing now?  As for your friend,  did you say something again and is this the resistance you are referring to?  I know that as someone who struggled with an eating disorder for a very long time, and am now in recovery, it was difficult when people would tell me I needed help.  I knew it on a deep level, but would never give people the satisfaction of agreeing.  First, I needed to ""protect"" myself against the eating disorder being taken away as it was needed, or so I thought.  What it did in was nearly  kill me instead and ruined a good part of my life.  I think it is so kind of you and caring to be thinking of your friend and wanting to help her.  Perhaps you can write her a letter, I suggest writing it instead of texting or e mailing as it is more private and personal.  I would tell her why you are concerned, that you knew someone you were close to who suffered with bulimia and that you see some similar behaviors or actions in her that this other person did.  You may or may not want to say it is your sister to protect her confidentiality.  In my belief, it is better to have a falling out with a friend if it means they may listen and get help.  It may save her life.  But it is up to you.  If you are a praying man, I would consider praying about it first and asking God what direction He thinks you should go in.  Again it takes a caring person to even notice another one who is suffering.  Thank you.","Hi, Welcome to the forum.  I am encouraged to hear how much you care about your friend.

36,09/17/2018,Help!WeddingStressonBulimicFriend,"My best friend is getting married next month. She has struggled with bulimia since high school (we are now in our late 20's) but has been doing well the last few years. Once the wedding started to get closer, her bulimia resurfaced. When I encouraged her to seek help, she refused to go back to the therapist that had helped her before because she said she's too busy with wedding planning and therapy is too expensive. As a result, I've watched her tailspin in an awful cycle for the better part of a year. She has latched on to an online fitness influencer that does a lot of ""challenges"". Once a month or so, she'll ask me to do a challenge with her. I'm a pretty healthy person these days, I work out regularly and use flexible dieting to stay in good shape, so I can't bring myself to participate in these challenges, but I have always supported her in what she believes will be best for her.

I'm a pretty healthy person these days, I work out regularly and use flexible dieting to stay in good shape, so I can't bring myself to participate in these challenges, but I have always supported her in what she believes will be best for her. Well, today I just hit a little bit of a breaking point. Her wedding is in just over a month, and she believes that she has to lose a certain amount of weight before the wedding day so she is cutting all sugar, dairy and alcohol (worth noting: these are all the things she binges on) from her diet and forcing herself to do multiple workouts every day. This is not healthy, and I can't stand by and support it. I know that this is just going to result in her going hardcore on this challenge for maybe 3 or 4 days, getting exhausted and stressed, and then having a binge and purging. It's a cycle I know well at this point and I can't bear to see it starting again and just stand by her as she does it. I expressed this concern to her, and practically begged her to focus on moderation and what makes her feel healthy, but she basically told me that her health is something to worry about after the wedding, but right now losing that weight is all that matters. She is very defensive when anyone challenges her on knowing what's best for her health, and I'm worried that not giving her the support she is asking of me may make things a million times worse. At the same time, my conscience is tearing me up about supporting something that I know will just make her condition worse and may end with a hospital visit instead of a happy wedding. I just don't know what to do. Has anyone else been in a similar position? Any suggestions you have will be most welcome. Thanks.",Hello and welcome to the forums esbee.

37,02/21/2019,Lostandfeelinghelpless,"An internet friend of mine has an eating disorder and lately it's been really hard watching her go through this and feeling like there's nothing I can do to help her. We've been friends for almost a year, and she told me pretty early on that she struggles with anorexia. For a while it seemed like I was able to help her; assuring her that it's okay to get a snack if she's hungry, reminding her that her struggles are valid, listening to her when she's feeling scared and letting her know that she's safe. But lately it's felt more and more like I can't help her anymore. We start getting into debates because she comes to me saying she's scared or stressed because she had lunch and she's still hungry and I try and tell her that that's normal and it's okay to have a snack. I know that by her coming to me it means there's a part of her that wants to get better, she knows I'm going to encourage her to do what deep, deep down she knows is best, but it's like she's also trying to convince herself through convincing me that it's okay to just not eat.
Her parents aren't the greatest people in the world. When she went to them in the past for help with mental illness they didn't give her the resources she needed and it changed nothing, but they won't go any other way. She's still a minor, but in the state she lives in she can legally receive outpatient care for mental health without parental consent; the only thing is, I have no clue how to convince her that she needs to do it. She's terrified of getting better and refuses to even think about it. She's also scared of the things that could happen to her health if she gets worse, but she's more willing to do things that aren't good for her health to try and find that control she longs for and reach her goal weight.
I just don't know what to do anymore. If I try and convince her to get help she spirals, but if I say nothing or tell her she doesn't need to think about getting help right now I feel like I'm enabling her to continue ruining herself. It's especially hard when we live states apart and I can only help her online and not in person. My question is, does anyone have any tips on how to approach the situation and maybe convince her to get the help she both needs and deserves?","Hi tryingfriend,","Hi tryingfriend,First off, I wanted to welcome you to the NEDA online community forums!

38,02/18/2019,AdvicePlease,"Hi there. My daughter's good friend (a teen) was recently hospitalized with anorexia. I found out from her mother. When I broke the news about her friend's hospitalization to my daughter, she already knew because she has been getting texts from her from the hospital. The friend is in denial, very angry about being hospitalized, feels it is against her will. Obviously there is concern of her not consenting to treatment.  Before I told my daughter, I had asked her mother would be appropriate from us for support. Mom told me that the teen doesn't have access to phone or media. But it seems that isn't true because she has been texting my daughter. I don't want to jeopardize the trust between her and my daughter, she obviously needs support. Do I tell Mom that her daughter may have access to a phone?","Snapz,","Snapz,I'm sure there will be different opinions on this.  Some will say that your daughters' friend should be kept in line, and her phone discovered and taken away from her.  That those in authority know what's best for her, and that strict treatment is just what she needs. Even if that means that the trust she's given your daughter should be betrayed.

Even so, I think that there may be value in the fact that she feels that she has at least one person who she's able to be honest with her feelings.  Perhaps these are not the same feelings that others might wish to force her to have, but they are her feelings none the less.  And may be different than what she tells those who are trying to control her.  But apparently she has one person who's input she feels she might trust, and that's what's coming from your daughter.  And there could be some possible value in that.","Snapz,I'm sure there will be different opinions on this.

I didn’t understand that evil was already inside her. Even if people didn’t see it.
I used to love her. Even if people didn’t see it.
Now B. is recovering without me and it’s slowly clawing at my soul.","I should have discovered this safe place a long time ago. Now it’s too late.
I will write to free my heart.
I would like to write a story. The story of my greatest friendship of which I am guilty of putting an end to it.
I am here writing in a foreign language because I hope someone can learn from my mistakes.What hurts is not knowing. I will never know why she has distanced herself from me.
Was it my fault? Did I do something wrong, as usual?
What was supposed to do? What was expected of me?
Why did everything seem ok to me?I thought if she was felt ill, she would tell me. I was convinced that our friendship was stronger than any disease.
I was always on her side. Always. I protected her or I believed to do it.She was B. I was V.
I want to tell you the story of a friendship lost for my stupidity. How many friendships have been destroyed by love?
Maybe I was looking for her too often. Maybe I hugged her too much. Maybe I hold her too close.Two chaos meet, they get close and then they drift apart.
Yin and Yan, two opposites hug each other with a point of the other within themselves.
She was graceful and kind. I was brave and sassy. The same sensibility has led us to the ocean of pain.
We had two different sufferings, two different mental illness.
I wonder if in the end it was the same face wearing two different masks: depression and anorexia.
When we were together, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. The fire lived in our hug.At a certain point she started to avoid me.
I thought that she didn’t want me anymore, that she replaced me with other new friends.
Now I’ll always wonder for the rest of my life how it would have been different if I had waited a while longer her to open up.
But for me it was impossible to just sit and watch her slipped out of my hands.Don’t make my own mistakes. Regret is a heartrending grief, a litany of tears and nightmares.

We are so glad that you have come here for some advice and support. I am concerned about some of the things you've stated in this post. I am not a health care provider, but I recommend calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) if you are feeling depressed and need someone to talk to. We care about what happens to you and your friend, so please feel free to post as often as you would like here, as you always have a listening ear on the NEDA forums.","Hi.  I just read what you posted.  It sounds very sad.  Sometimes people we love and who love us pull away when they need us the most.  Or push away someone they love.  As you seem to be experiencing. I would give her space, but let her know you are there when she is ready.  If you are not able to speak with her at this time, just be available for when or if she comes back.  She may be going through a lot right now and may not know how to handle things the way you would want, but it doesn't mean you are a bad person or that you did anything wrong.  It seems that you were very close and the loss is great.  I am sorry for your pain.  I am glad you posted and have reached out for support.  I do not know what to say except that I hear your pain, and you are not alone here.  Please continue to write as you express yourself well with words.  It may help you to process through writing.  Please let us know how you are doing.","Hi.  I just read what you posted.  It sounds very sad.  Sometimes people we love and who love us pull away when they need us the most.

40,01/11/2019,Acquaintanceofminethatmayhaveaneatingdisorder,"Hi, so my mom has one friend whose son seems to have an eating disorder, he has lost a lot of weight, exercises vigorously and apparently (his mom doesn't know yet) he is throwing up after meals. He is not my friend but I've known him for a long time and I myself am recovering from anorexia so I kinda know what is happening.
The problem is that I can't help him because my mom told me about his problems so I am not supposed to know anything about it and if I talk to him, I'll let my mom as a gossiper, but his mom is not doing anything to help him so I am desperate and don't know what to do!","Hi, yae_tu, we're sorry to hear that someone you know might have an eating disorder!

Maybe your Mom can share with his mother her insights and thoughts?  How are you doing?  It this causing your struggle to worsen?  I would suggest talking to your Mom and tell her of your concerns for him and that you want him to get help.  Maybe the two of you can figure something out.  That way you won't feel like you are breaking a confidence.  Sometimes though, for the sake of health, it needs to be done.  Better to lose a friend in terms of fellowship that to lose that friend to death.  A though answer I know.  Eating disorders are deadly as I think you may be aware of.  I will pray that you know what to do. Please let us know how things go.  I am also sorry this sat for such a long time

41,01/15/2019,Myfriendwithbulimia,"My best friend, let’s call her Max has an eating disorder. I noticed something was going on some time ago, maybe two months? But I wasn’t sure and her behaviour was pretty normal so I ignored it(I know I shouldn’t have). Few days ago she told me that she is struggling with bulimia for 6 months already. She said, that she realized that she can’t handle it on her own, so she told her mom about it. At first her mom ignored what she said. When she repeated the same thing, only thing she heard in response was 'don’t exaggerate'. After some time she started the same conversation. Her parents told her to just stop. After few more attempts they told her that for now she will be eating what they will tell her to and she cannot vomit. Today in school she told me almost crying that they don’t  want to send her to a doctor. I’m so sad that she is doing it, but I know she needs professional help. But if her parents say no, her  condition won’t improve. How can I help her? How can I give her support? What she/we can do to convince her parenltd that she’s not just making it up? I can already see that she has changed. I really don’t know what to do.Thanks in advance, Maddie","Hi, maddz, welcome to the NEDA forums. We're so sorry to hear about your friend and her parents' reaction. It sounds really frustrating since it seems like you really want to help her! You can take a look at this link: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/help/caregivers. It includes the parent toolkit, if you or her feel comfortable sharing that with her parents so that they can get a better understanding of eating disorders and provide her with the support she deserves! We hope that you can get the support you're looking for through these forums.

42,12/28/2018,"Myfriendadmittedshehasanorexia,thenliedandtookitback","So one day me and two friends were talking about random stuff when my friend says (with sincerity) “I am anorexic”. She tried to brush past it, and I saw the regret in her face immediately after. It’s not that she didn’t trust us, she’s trusted me for a while, and the other girl for even longer, but she seemed like she didn’t believe herself. The problem with that is, me and the other girl already knew. She has for a while talked about over excersizing, not eating, and fearing weight gain (even though she’s about X pounds underweight already). Nowadays, she will talk in casual conversation about it, admitting that she has an ed. Me and the other girl present also have mental health problems, I especially joke a lot to cope so it’s a thing me and the girl with the ed tend to do on low days, I know it’s not good but I can’t get her to stop without being a hypocrite and I don’t want to stop myself. So she has no problem venting about how “oh I nearly passed out today lol” but the second me and the other girl try to talk seriously about it to see how we can help, she shuts down and starts panicking and saying “nah I’m fineeee you’re being ridiculousssss”. And if she’s not shutting us down she’s mad because we told her that she doesn’t need to worry about the calories in whatever food she’s currently worried about. Are we doing something wrong? Should we forgo her wishes and tell an adult (she’s only 15 after all)? Should we just tell her what’s shes doing is okay? I’m worried that saying anything she doesn’t want to hear will make her more secretive. I don’t know what to do.","We are glad that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

Like so she can come to her own conclusions, you know ?","This is kind of a late reply, but I hope that you get to see it.You are right -It's hard to know the right things to say in situations like this. Your friend seems like she really does want to talk about her situation, or else she wouldn't be saying anything.  But yeah, when you treat it as serious, then she clams up. What this means to me is that even she doesn't quite know what to think about her situation.  Is she really ""fine"" or is she in trouble? It sounds like she doesn't quite know.  People can be pretty deep into their EDs and still not quite know what to think.  So you might want to say that to her :  ""I know it must be hard to know what to think about your situation.""   She may just repeat that everything's ""fine"", but it's also possible that she could say ""yeah"".  ""...if she’s not shutting us down she’s mad because we told her that she doesn’t need to worry about the calories in whatever food she’s currently worried about.""Well she's probably right in getting upset, because I think you can be certain that she does worry about calories.  To the point of obsession. So when you tell her she doesn't need to worry, you are kind of showing her that you just don't get it.  Which is probably what's making her angry.  Maybe the better thing to say is something like ""It must be difficult worrying about calories all the time like this.""  Because that would totally be true. What you are working towards is a place where she trusts that you get it, if you follow me ?  Which will make it easier for her to talk to you and to trust you.  Because it sounds to me like she's looking for that.  Someone to really tell, you know ?In the end she'll need to get some kind of help, like with the counsellor at school or telling her parents.

43,12/10/2018,OnlineFriendHasEDandWon'tGetHelp,"Hello, I have an online friend who I've been friends with for a while. She's starving herself and refusing to seek help until she ""reaches a certain weight"". She expresses that she feels panic when she eats and goes on frequent unhealthy fasts, and she's recently joined a pro-anorexia chat group because she says she doesn't want to recover yet and says she doesn't care what happens to her as long as she loses weight. What can I do to help her?","Hi and welcome to the forum.  I am sorry about your friend.  Unfortunately until someone wants to get help, there is not much we can do, especially in your situation. If you knew more about this person, or where they lived, others that know them, that would be a little different.  You can encourage your friend to get help, give her NEDA's web site, share the dangers of anorexia, but if she doesn't want to get better, it is difficult. You can be there for her but if she is only going to talk about losing weight and isn't open to change, I myself would have to draw a boundary and say if you want to talk fine, but if you only want to talk about the anorexia and what she is doing to starve herself I wouldn't engage in that.  That is just something that I don't believe would be helpful for either of you.  If you knew her more and were able to tell someone that could intervene, that would be an option, but she is an online friend.  So unfortunately there is only so much we can do.  Please let us know how things go.  And if you need support we are here for you as well.  Thank you for caring.","Hi and welcome to the forum.  I am sorry about your friend.

I speak with a lot of people like your friend, and really, one of the few approaches one can take is to agree with them, and commiserate when they talk about about the negative ways that their EDs are impacting their lives.  Because yeah, if a person is panicking about eating, and suffering through the sorts of things that come from starvation (both physical and mental), or how their studies are wiping out, or how they have a hard time hanging out with their friends anymore, or how their depression and anxiety is getting worse... they can generally agree with you that those things are a bummer.  Which…that's a perspective that they'll need to reach if they are ever going to begin thinking about recovery.

So while they may still be pressing forward with their EDs, at the same time, on most contemporary forums, there's also a general vibe that the ED situation is nothing that anyone would want to get involved with, and which large parts of their self would rather be free of.

My sense is that she would not be talking to you at all, unless she was having some doubts about her situation.  A thing which is encouraging I think, even if she has not moved forward to the part where she's thinking about getting help.

However we just went on a camping trip and I noticed she barely ate anything. When we got back, I was on my computer and I saw that her google account was still signed in (she borrowed my computer for school) and thinking about the anorexia, I snooped (I feel bad about it). The only document she edited on her google drive was a calendar of sorts labeled with her daily calorie intake and on another page was a bunch of exercises. I have come to the conclusion that she is definitely anorexic. This is VERY BAD and I am VERY WORRIED. She is my best friend. We are both sophomores in high school, but we go to different high schools. I will see her tomorrow at a sailing practice and I'm wondering:","So I have been worried that my friend may be anorexic for a couple of months now, but these suspicions were only slight and I only see her in the afternoon so I figured she was eating more just when I wasn't there.

I am a recovering from my earring disorder now after a very long and dangerous journey that has some parallels that you see in your friend. My advice is that you need to speak out and fast. I had no idea how much physical damage i had done to my body and if it had carried on longer my life was in very high danger. If you are worried about falling out with your friend don’t be. Her health is more important and if she gets angry just know this is the ed speaking not her and in time she will see that again. Try voicing your concerns and if she doesn’t agree to seeking help speak to her parents or adult who can help. For know if she doesn’t speak to you, you may have to deal with it but I promise she will be so grateful to u once she is in recovery. For the sake of her health please speak out as soon as you can as this (despite what her ed will make her say) is what she needs the most. All the best, you are so strong and such a caring friend x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,09/05/2018,Familymemberwithunsupportedparents,"I recently learned that my cousin, who is 16, has been eating very little and counting calories and basically exhibiting all the symptoms of anorexia. She has struggled in the past with anxiety before and I believe shes getting help for that. The problem is, her parents do not take these issues as seriously as they should be. Her parents were aware that she was having problems for a long time but didn't act on it. Her parents are so embarrassed of her that they refuse to talk to anyone in the family about it, my older cousin who is an adult found out about her anxiety by chance, and she was the one who told me about it. My older cousin has been monitoring her as much as she can, and that how she found out about the anorexia, but there is only so much she can do. Talking to her parents doesn't seem to be an option because we are pretty sure her mothers obsession with her weight is what caused the anorexia in the first place. I'm extremely worried about my cousin but I'm just not sure what to do. Her family doesn't know that anyone else is aware of her eating disorder, and from what I know she refuses to talk to anyone about anything even related to it because she got angry when my older cousin brought up her anxiety. I'm not sure what I can do, I don't know how to bring it up without making her angry and I don't want her to put up a wall between us, as I'm the closest to her age in the family and probably the one she trusts the most. I've tried talking to the adults in my family and they are just not sure how they can help without the parents support. It's a difficult situation and I just don't know what to do but I can't just sit here and wait around like all the adults are doing and expecting it to get better, because I know it won't get better unless she get professional help. I'm just extremely worried and scared, and if anyone has any advice I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.","Hi.  I am glad that you have been concerned about your cousin and want to help her.  It does sound complicated as her parents don't seem too inclined to want to help which is a shame.  I know NEDA has some great people to talk with and they may be your best chance at getting some good advice on how to help her.  I know when I was sixteen and in the middle of my struggle with anorexia NO ONE was going to help me or tell me what to do.  I was FINE.  But that is the illness speaking and if that is where your cousin is, I understand her resistance in wanting any help.  Perhaps you can just let her know for now that you are there for her if she needs or wants to talk.  Make yourself available to her in a non threatening way.  Build up some trust and then maybe she may give you an opportunity to share your concerns.  Also maybe talk to a school guidance counselor.  Or another trusted adult.  As you know eating disorders are serious and usually only get worse unless there is some intervention.  I wish you the best and hope to hear from you about how things go..  Take care and thanks for caring.","Hi.  I am glad that you have been concerned about your cousin and want to help her.

47,07/11/2018,Long-DistanceFriendwithED,"I have a friend who moved but we still keep in touch through social media. Recently she has started making Instagram posts regarding her eating habits. She posts calorie counts and discusses her attempts at purging. I am extremely concerned for her but I have no clue what to do, especially as I can't talk to her about it in person.
However, I follow the accounts of one of her close friends as well as her sister. Neither of them have seen her posts about her eating, as the posts are on an account they don't know about. Would it make sense to tell them about the posts? What is the best thing to do in this situation?","Hello colincantwell! We are glad that you are sharing your story here on the NEDA forums.

Your story breaks my heart.  The burden of promising not to tell and then knowing how ill your friend was.  I am glad you told her mom.  Sometimes we have to break a promise when someone is so ill they are unable to be rational.   HOW ARE YOU doing?  How is the bulimia?  Now that your friend is so far away, and isn't doing well, how is it affecting you and your recovery.  Have you ever considered taking a time off for a while if her behaviors are really affecting you?   Do you know that it is okay to do that?   Take care of yourself without feeling guilty?  The best thing you can do for your friend is to take care of yourself and get into recovery yourself and get well.  It all sounds so difficult and no easy answers.

I am glad you told her mom.  Sometimes we have to break a promise when someone is so ill they are unable to be rational.   HOW ARE YOU doing?  How is the bulimia?  Now that your friend is so far away, and isn't doing well, how is it affecting you and your recovery.  Have you ever considered taking a time off for a while if her behaviors are really affecting you?   Do you know that it is okay to do that?   Take care of yourself without feeling guilty?  The best thing you can do for your friend is to take care of yourself and get into recovery yourself and get well.  It all sounds so difficult and no easy answers.

48,04/04/2018,Mygirlfriendhasathinobssession,"My girlfriend has a eating disorder, she has already gone a a psychologist (sorry for my bad english but im a Portuguese Highschool student and so is she) and she managed to ""trick"" him but i know she's not doing fine. She has been on a pretty severe depression until we started dating, but she still keeps the same obsession. Not being fat. She even said to me one time ""i want to stop thinking like and this and get a healthy weight and diet for myself, but i can't just let go all of my effort of NF and reffusing to eat"". The thing is i have told her many times to get some weight and to eat healthy and she says she's gonna get it but instead of gaining weight, she loses it, and i dont know what to do. Please help me, she has gone through some dramatic times when she used to engage in ED behaviors and i want her to get better. She wants to be thin but im afraid thats not the best for her. Please help me, tell me ""topics"" that i could use to persuade her or things that i cold do to help her, please. She has a very bad relationship with her parents and im one of the only ones who can trully help her. She's very sensible to questions related do me but still she cant do what i ask her to do even for her to do it for me...","Hey Gugui,","Hey Gugui,Welcome, I'm glad you found the forums and reached out!

She is gonna start going on psychologists and nutritionists (i dont know if thats how you spell it) and she promised me she'd get better, but she said the same the last 2 or 3 times bad things happened like when the skipped meals, when her mom got to know what she's been up to, and the times she went to her doctor. From what she's told me, she used to be anorexic like 3 years ago, then things got ""better"", because on the inside she still was hurting, and now... now its like this, she had a certain weight in August i think, and she is now on the level of ""low weight"" on Body Mass Index. Thank you for your tips, ill take those into consideration. I think the best answer to your question is, when i ask her about that stuff, she tells me ""I know what i sould do and i know what has to be done and i know its the healthiest, yet it's not easy"", and then she just ignore everything i said and say, and goes to do things wrong again... i dont really understand.

50,03/04/2018,HELP!,"I'm kind of at a loss where to go at this point. My best friend is suffering from multiple eating disorders within the last year. She was what is considered a healthy weight for her on paper based on her height, but she lost weight quickly. She no longer has a menstrual cycle, and her lab work always came back with not-so-good results. After running a half marathon in October, she began to eat again, but not just eat, binge eat. She now, in just 4 more months, has gained weight again. She is the heaviest she has ever been. Over those 4 months, she was in treatment for a short period of time, but felt it ""didn't help her,"" so she left. Now, she tells me she understands why people commit self-harm. She feels like she is never good enough, she says she has nothing good in her life, and she won't workout anymore because ""there is no point."" I'm truly worried she is going to hurt herself, even though she says she would never. She is almost 24 years old, so I can't walk her into a facility; she has to make these decisions herself. I just don't know what to do at this point. Financially she feels she cannot afford to do a residential treatment stay, or anymore treatment for that matter, but at this point, she needs it more than anything. If anyone has any advice or insight I would be SUPER grateful. Thank you!","I'm sorry to see your friend is going through a tough time. Having an ED has such ups and downs. Supporting a friend with an ED is also a very tough spot to be in. Would you or your friend feel comfortable reaching out to NEDA? You can speak to a trained professional about what she is going through and available treatment by calling(M- TH 9-9 EST and F 9-5 EST) 800 - 931 - 2237 or texting ""NEDA"" to 741741 to speak with a Crisis Text Line trained volunteer.

You’ve shown how much you love and are committed to your friend, which is a testament to your own loyalty and strength. But sometimes we can’t do anything except step back and hope our loved ones can carry on. I know it’s such a helpless feeling. You say you have a family of your own. I hope they are supportive of you and your efforts for your friend. Or perhaps a therapist might be able to help you sort through some of your feelings. I’m no professional, but I’ve been to them, and they’ve helped me a lot.","Hi.  I just want to send encouragement your way.  What is happening is extremely scary I am sure and frustrating and fearful.   You have done your best to help your friend.  It is now time for your friend to be honest with her therapist and understand the consequences for her actions and behaviors.  It is NOT YOUR FAULT.  You need to take care of yourself and your family.  That may sound callous, but you are correct in saying you are not her therapist.  She just may need a wake up call and you pulling out a bit on your involvement may be the best thing for her.  You can not save her.  She needs to come to the point where she wants to live and take steps that will promote life.  No one can do it for her.  Each individual has to come to that point where they are ready to fight for themselves.   Seems like she's burnt everyone out and for you to think that your hanging in there for her is going to make her decide to live is a burden you shouldn't have to carry.  I hear the hurt, frustration and fear in your post.  It is scary to watch a friend die.  Slowly.  You have done all you can do.  I am not saying give up on her.  But as you pointed out you area setting boundaries which is so important for you, your family and your friend.   If she is venting but not changing anything, not listening to advice, but just wanting to vent, that isn't helping her.   Hard to hear, hard to take in, but from my perspective, it isn't helping her from what you are posting.  I am sorry this isn't very uplifting but the situation is dire.   Something has to change.

I lost relationships with my sisters over my eating disorder.  My parents have stood by me and I am now in recovery.  LONG time coming but I am in the early stages of recovery.  And it feels so freeing.  Your friend has to find a reason for her to want to live.  That has to come from her.","Hi.  I just want to send encouragement your way.

53,02/26/2018,"FriendwithrelapsingED,I'mtheonlypersonshe'stold","A friend of mine who has been growing closer to me recently informed me of her struggle with an eating disorder.  She's told me she's had it before going back as far as middle school, but somehow had a little bit of progress towards recovery before.  She told me before she let a counselor at her school know and she was pulled out of class to be weighed.  I know she doesn't want this again.  She knows the dangers of the disorder and has already seen its effects in increased weakness, fatigue, and irritability, but she doesn't care about those effects since she ""craves the high"" not eating gives her.  She comes from a broken home, parents divorced at a young age, which bothers her very much and she's not afraid to admit that.  Her dad and stepmom fight a lot, and, from what I know, her mom isn't really there for her.  I've told her I'm concerned for her and I'm here to listen and I will be the first person to be with her if she decides she needs treatment.  I know she has the conscience to realize what she's doing to herself, but she doesn't see enough value in her life to stop the disorder.  She's told me all she wants to do is hurt herself.  I've told her that if she hurts herself in this way, it's not only going to have effects on just her.  She doesn't have a desire to be treated and I know I can't force her into recovery.  I'm at a loss of what can be done, since I can't go over her head for fear of worsening the disorder.  She feels bad in the first place for telling me about her and I've tried consoling her telling her she did the right thing by telling someone.  She repeatedly tells me she's fine and that she's sorry for burdening me, a big root of the issue.  She doesn't want to burden anyone with her disorder.  I don't know what else can be done.  I don't want to see it get to the point of someone I care about being hospitalized before she realizes she needs treatment.","Your friend was very courageous in opening up to you about her eating disorder. That means she must trust you. And from your post, I can see she continues to talk to you. Of course you're worried and feel helpless--you can't force her to do anything. And she was burned at school when they pulled her out to weigh her. ","Your friend was very courageous in opening up to you about her eating disorder. That means she must trust you. And from your post, I can see she continues to talk to you. Of course you're worried and feel helpless--you can't force her to do anything. And she was burned at school when they pulled her out to weigh her. The best you might be able to do is to continue to listen and provide support when she's in the mood to talk. It's very difficult to be that support person when you don't see progress, but she will nonetheless be thankful to you. Perhaps gently suggest she might want to seek professional help. Maybe she would benefit from the anonymity of chatting with a trained volunteer. It's totally confidential. It's not ""recovery"" per se, but your friend would have a chance to ""open up"" in a safe way.
