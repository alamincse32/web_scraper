0,04/08/2019,Mysisterisevil,SueBanks,"I am really struggling to come to terms with my sister ruining my family. She has been ill for approx 12 years now, and I am at breaking point. I was still growing up when her issues began, and as she is my older sister, I assumed all older sisters were nasty, hysterical, violent, manipulative, and generally unstable. As I got older, this became quite obviously untrue. My sister struggles with lots of mental health issues, but the ones which manifest themselves most obviously are the anorexia and bulimia b/p. To preface this, I am well aware, all too aware, of the affects of eating disorders on the brain. I know she is not in control/her brain is starved, she does not choose to be unwell. Unfortunately, when it comes to my sister, it is not that simple. The fact of the matter is that before she even got ill, she was quite horrible. Now she is unwell, everyone says, 'oh, its not her fault, she's sick! poor her'. For starters, she was nasty before, so it's not all the illness. Second of all, poor her?! Poor my mum, poor my dad, poor me? My mother cries herself to sleep every night, my sister is very abusive to her and constantly tries to blame her and inflict pain on her. She is a nasty, nasty girl, and I don't know what to do. When people hear she is mentally ill, they immediately gravitate toward sympathy. I don't understand where the sympathy or understanding for family members who are under the complete control of the ill person is? She rules my family like a despotic leader, my parents are so scared of her harming herself that they will do whatever she wants. She steals, she lies, she abuses, and no one says anything. I don't know her at all. Before I was 10, she was horrible, and from the age of 10-21, she was horrible and mentally ill. It's incredibly hard to feel supportive, and in fact I no longer feel supportive at all. For a while, I tried to help her - for years, in fact, to have it thrown back in my face. She refuses to live with my parents despite the fact that they pay for everything as she dropped out of school, uni, and refuses to get a job. So now she is living with me - she leaves mouldy food everywhere, breaks appliances by purging into them, blocks my plumbing, makes me gets rats, and I have no choice because where else would she go? On top of it all, she is horrible. My parents don't want to get her committed as they fear she would hate them forever, yet her weight is lower than ever and she is very obviously deeply unwell. I am sick and tired of her and I am sick and tired of her abusing and manipulating my family. I feel horrible writing that I have given up on a family member, but I can't take it anymore. I just want to know that some other people have also reached the end of their tether. Please don't lecture me/say I am being mean. I don't have capacity for that.",iwanttolive,"Tue,04/09/2019-10:05pm","Hello.  I am so, so sorry for you pain.   I get the feeling that you were probably also neglected as your parents have put all their attention onto your sister who doesn't seem to want their help, just their handouts.  You are not selfish nor are you being mean.  You are suffering and are in a lot of pain.  You are probably worried, angry, worried about your parents, feeling badly that you have been overlooked, correct me if I am wrong.  When a member of the family is so sick, often parent's are unable to let go and say no more.  Not no more love, but until the individual, your sister, is wanting to get help, to change, than something has to change.  I would like to explain my situation because I feel it is similar.  My sister pretty much lives in her room in bed.  I don't know when she eats or even goes to the bathroom.  She has ligit medical problems, but she isn't getting the help she needs.  She had been living at her house for twenty years rarely leaving her couch.  Then she moved in with me about two years ago.  She rarely leaves her room and now claims intractable pain, isn't eating, sleeping, so she says, and I am angry.  She never asks how I am doing.  She is very self absorbed and I am upset that my parent's allow her to do this.  for the better part of two years my sister has been a control freak, never contributing to household expenses, never cleans, everything is done for her.  Just recently she has been mandated to contribute to household expenses by our father who is our landlord.  There were such fights even though she hardly came out of her room.  I was ready to leave, but I can not afford to.  She doesn't listen to anyone even doctors.  My Mom is conflicted because of her medical issues.  I think they are doing too  much for her.  I know they are worried about her physical health but what they can not grasp is that they are hurting her more than they are helping her.  And I am angry.  I am told not to be, that I have a choice to be angry or not, but I am also afraid that she is going to die.
Back to you sister.  To have someone who is mean, cruel perhaps, running the two households and holding everyone hostage is not fair.  Does she have to live with you?  Can you find your own place?  It may not bode well with your parents but that is not your responsibility.   Right now you need to take care of you before you get sick.  People can take advantage of their mental illness and use it as an excuse, my idea.   If someone isn't willing or able to get the help they need someone needs to be called in and an assessment needs to take place to see if she is safe to be living by herself.  You can not take care of her.  You have your own life.  It is not fair for your parent's to expect you to, especially if she is abusing you.  That is not to be tolerated.  Mentally ill or not.  I am really sorry for all the fear you have lived with all these years, the years that were stolen from you due to your sisters illness.  Your own losses and confusion.  What do your other siblings have to say about all of this? Can you talk to a therapist and ask them what they think you should do?  Get help for yourself to talk about your pain and suffering?  You can't keep doing this forever.  She needs help and you can not help her as her needs are too great.I do not think you are being mean or selfish.  You have lived with all of this rage, pain, hurt, anger, seeing what is happening to your  mom, it is a lot.  Please continue to reach out and please let me know what you think about what I said.  You are not alone here.iwanttolive",BobJ48,"Thu,04/11/2019-11:16am","After IW2L's note, it's hard to know what to add, but here's a few thoughts.These situations are abusive.  We are taught that abuse is when the person with the most power takes advantage of those with less power, but sometimes it's just the opposite - The person who casts themselves as ill or powerless is the one who takes the role of the tyrant. As westernized modern humans, we are also taught to believe that if somehow we manage to discover the proper response, and discover how do the right thing, that things will somehow work out in the end.  And if things don't work out, somehow it's because of our own shortcomings or even worse - our selfishness.  I'm not sure if other cultures see things that way, but others can use those beliefs against us.  When things are working out in ways that are ideal.Then there's the notion of personal responsibility, and responsibility as a whole.   And how it applies to our family and friends, and how it applies to ourselves.  So yeah, we try and be helpful.  We are trying to hold up our end of the bargain.  But when the other person seems not to be holding up their end, then what should we do ?And how should we feel about ourselves ?  And what do we owe our own selves ?It's a rough situation for sure.",EmmaWilks,"Tue,01/21/2020-11:04am","Hi Sue, I've just joined the site therefore just read your post. As a fellow younger sister of an eating disorder sufferer I can absolutely relate. In fact your story sounds very similar to mine, at least at the beginning. Fortunately at the age of 21 and after 10 years of suffering, my sister moved away from our family and started her own healing journey. It came about after my parents threw up their hands and said she could no longer stay. It was the hardest thing for my parents to do, and it broke my heart to give up on my older sister. We didn't know if she would live or die, but we knew she couldn't stay and continue to destroy our family and herself.
She went through a hard road, but she is now much healthier than before. I'm not sure you can say she is free from mental illness, but her physical health is good and that has helped substantially with her mental health.
I commend you Sue for doing so much for your sister, for not giving up. You are a kind and loving person. From my experience though, the care you provide her may be allowing her to continue to manipulate you and your family and hence prolong her (and your suffering). She's not evil, this illness is evil and it's taken her over. It hurts me to say it, but you need to let her go. You need to show the illness that you will no longer let it control your life, and this will also show your sister that it doesn't have to control hers. Please have hope, and tell her to have hope, cuz it is curable, but it will take space and time and discipline on your part to commit to letting her begin to heal on her own (and with the help of prodessionals if she chooses).
My heart goes out to you girl, and to your sister. Good luck, let me know if you wanna chat more. Emma",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,01/13/2020,MyBrother,Miggi,"A couple of months ago I was reading and posting on the forum when I came across a post that went something like this, ""I have a lot of anxiety surrounding what my sister eats. I have bad eating habits and sometimes so does she. I always compare what I eat to what she eats. I just have to eat less than her, and it makes me so sad when she doesn't eat a lot, I have a problem with eating and she knows this, but I just have to eat less than her.""
I didn't think much of it until I saw the username, it was my brothers name. And what was posted seemed like he definitely wrote it. I think a lot about that now.

2,12/21/2019,Beingabigsisterinrecovery,Elvira,"So I’m in recovery from anorexia. I have two little sisters who don’t live with me, but whom I’m very close to. This summer we spent a lot of time together when my ED was in full swing. They saw it progressively get worse and worse and they also saw the beginning days of my recovery. Even in my ED, I tried to talk positively about food, but I know actions speak louder than words. I feel really bad because I never want them to do this to themselves.
They are also going through some tough stuff. One of them eats like a normal kid but has major self esteem issues (I see so much of myself in her it’s scary) and the other way really healthy and is constantly praised for it. Neither of them have given me cause to think they have a food problem.
I know because of recovery I’m super vigilant about food, diet culture, eating, body talk, etc.
I guess my point is: for you guys who are siblings of people with EDs, what are some things that would have helped you? What can I be doing to be a better older sister and example? I can’t turn off my discomfort and attitude towards food and every day is a battle but I love them and I want that love to be stronger than my eating disorder.",iwanttolive,"Sat,12/28/2019-1:02am","Hi.  I am sorry you are dealing with an eating disorder.  I think it is so caring that you are reaching out for help to know how to help your younger siblings.  When I was young I never thought about how my illness would affect my sisters but it did.  I almost dies in front of my then thirteen year old sister, I was sixteen.  Since then my sisters have stayed their distance from me as I have been dealing with disordered eating for so long.  They blamed me for being sick and don't understand that a lot of the way they have coped with life has in some ways been just as unhealthy but since I was in the hospital so many times I am blamed for not getting over it.As far as how you can help your siblings, I guess just having an open dialogue with them.  Let them know-if you are comfortable with this idea-that if they have any questions or concerns that they can talk with you about them.  Also, being available to them if they are struggling with anything to know that they can come and talk to you about what is bothering them.  We can't go back and change what we've been through or are currently going through. But if you let them know that you are working on changing your relationship with food, maybe that will be enough.  I don't really know what to say other than that.  If you see signs of an eating disorder developing in your siblings, I maybe you could let someone know?  Let them know there are no good or bad foods.  I would try to be open and as honest with them as you feel would be good for them and for you.  Unfortunately this country is obsessed with thinness and perfection.  Let us be the ones to change that.  How I do not know.  By sharing our stories maybe.  Letting people know that having struggles with eating disorders is not a shameful thing but that we all deal with something and therefore we should not have to feel guilty for dealing with an eating disorder.  I say that to you.  There is no shame.  Your love is stronger than an eating disorder that you struggle with.  It is not you.  You are you.  Your love is you.  The inner you.  Your love is real and will prove to be the stronger of the two.  Hope this helps.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,12/13/2019,Sisterdoing12steps-forgiveness,oxred81,"Hi
My sister has had an eating disorder for years. she came out of a clinic two weeks ago. it was a clinic that treated eating disorders like an addiction, so started her along the 12 steps path used by AA and others. Today I think she must have got to a step about forgiveness as i got a message from her saying ' Today i decided to forgive you. not because you apologised or because you acknowledged the pain that you cased me, but because my soul deserves peace'.
I wasn't aware that she was feeling angry with me about anything. what do you recommend i do? it was a picture message from a calm app so I don't know what to do with it. It makes me angry tbh but I'm sure that's not a helpful response!
has anyone else's siblings gone through this?",BobJ48,"Sat,12/14/2019-7:35pm","Oh brother, I can see where this might be confusing !  But things like this happen sometimes, when people find themselves considering various emotional themes.   I'm not very familiar with 12 Step, but one of it's steps may involve the theme of forgiveness ?  And if that's the case, then maybe you might find yourself needing someone or something to forgive ?   Even if you hadn't really thought much about that before ?Having said that, yes, it's not too emotionally considerate to forgive someone, without informing them what it is that you are forgiving them for.  That sounds kind of passive-egressive to me. So in turn, you may need to forgive her for that ?  Not that I would tell her that, but maybe you know what I mean.  The whole thing must be kind of confusing I know.If it were me, I would not get into it with her.  This forgiveness thing is for her, and for a process of her own that she is going through, and there's probably something good to be said for that.So if you feel that you need to provide a response, you might simply say that you are glad that she is finally finding resolution for old issues that she may had in the past ?Which would be a truthful response, I suspect ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

  I was reading the post about your sister and was wondering how things are going now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,10/04/2019,Howtochoosepathoftreatmentformysister,jalis,I've done some research on eating disorder treatment (anorexia is my sister's issue) but how do you decide which kind of treatment? My sister works full time and has kids. There are centers that seem unrealistic due to the expectation that someone will spend many hours there per week. I also looked at psychiatrists which seem more realistic (1 hour per week or however many sessions you want to pay for). How to make a decision where to start? Each option is a little different. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks,_admin_moderator,"Tue,10/08/2019-1:48pm","Hi! Thank you for posting. We’re sorry to hear about what’s been going with your sister!

I am so sorry your sister is going through this terrible struggle, at the same time I am proud of you and want to say thank you to you on behalf of sisters who care enough to want to try to help their sibling.  As said, unfortunately we are unable to mention specific programs, but I would like you to consider something.    She is dealing with a life threatening illness.  Going into a partial hospital program my take her away from her job, for which she should have protection, and spend long days in therapy.  But if you look at the long picture, if it helps and she gets stronger, she will be able to be a better parent, and employee.  Eating disorders take so much from someone.  It is much like someone who is addicted to drugs.  Their only thought is how to get the next drug.  The brain is unable to function properly if not nourished.  Sound decisions, thinking clearly, just can not happen because the brain is malnourished along with the rest of her body.  So if she gets help now then she stands a better chance at weekly or bi-weekly therapy.  Unfortunately, it can be expensive to seek treatment, and it shouldn't be this way.  I am fortunate that I have Medicare and Medicaid and I can get therapy, but not with a trained eating disorder therapist.  But that is okay because I am in recovery and am back in therapy to help deal with an abusive family member and a family member who is young and may be going onto hospice soon.  But a therapist can help deal with underlying issues, fears, traumas, even if they don't specialize in eating disorders.  I hope this helps and thank you again for trying to help your sister.  Remember too that unless she wants the help, it limits what a therapist or treatment center can do.  Just a sad fact.   I wish you the best.iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,06/14/2019,whenwillitend?,orlandaws,"I have two younger sisters, they're identical twins and they both have been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa this year. They're fifteen. One twin is hospitalised at a facility for young people with eating disorders, and the other twin is recovering at home but she's too weak to go to school. They're both at different stages in their illness, but it's such a long road ahead that I feel overwhelmed by it all. I help my parents with both my sisters, but the way my mum in particular handles my sister (the one at home) and her re-feeding process/meal plan makes me angry. If my sister refuses to eat something, or cries, or shouts, or argues about a portion size/aspect of her meal, she reacts emotionally, will get upset, will try and make my sister feel guilty for being difficult, or will give into my sisters demands and change the meal according to her specifications. We got to family therapy and have all read books about anorexia, and she should know very well that this only fuels the eating disorder. My dad and I are much more on the same page. I ressent my mum for being so immature and unable to cope with my sister's illness. I myself am tired and I can't see an end to this. I plan every day around my sisters meals and her progress and I visit my other sister at least once a week. I've gone back on anti-depressants and I find work and school too much, let alone socialising. The twins' anorexia came out of nowhere for me and I'm still shocked, even though I've been living at home now for nearly two moths. When will things go back to how they were? When will things be like they used to? I can't talk to my parents about how I feel because I'm scared that I'll upset them further, and none of my friends understand what it's like to have a loved one with anorexia, let alone two loved ones. I just want someone to understand, I feel as if it has taken over my life and that it'll always be there.",BobJ48,"Sat,06/15/2019-12:29pm","""If my sister refuses to eat something, or cries, or shouts, or argues about a portion size/aspect of her meal, she reacts emotionally, will get upset, will try and make my sister feel guilty for being difficult, or will give into my sisters demands and change the meal according to her specifications.

""As you've seen, it's hard not to get drawn into the drama of it all.  And how the whole thing can bring up issues of our own.  Which is what seems to be going on with your mom.   Instead of sticking with the plan, she's letting her own stired up issues get in the way. This is not to say that people should never get frustrated, because EDs can really be frustrating.

So you're right, we probably need to find ways to keep ourselves safe too. Which may mean setting some boundaries.  Practical and emotional ones too.  You may want to make some changes in how much time you spend interacting with the situation. Like maybe don't go to the facility, but write your sister a note instead.

I feel a lot of guilt because I'm the oldest sister, and my two sisters idolise me and have ever since they were little. We've always been very close. I left home for the first time last year to work in France, the job was part of my university degree, and I was away when the first twin was admitted to hospital. My parents told me not to return home and I was scared about not honouring my job contract/not getting college credit. My parents said that coming home wouldn't change anything and I was only 6 weeks away from the end of my contract. When those 6 weeks were up and I did come home, I found the second twin emaciated and my parents in complete denial about it. They'd been focusing so much on the first twin who was diagnosed and in hospital, that the second twin was left to her own devices. I spoke with them the second I was home from the airport, and only then did they get her referred and eventually diagnosed and on a treatment plan. So basically, this all happened because I wasn't there to see the warning signs. I play in a band that tours regularly and I work part time at a studio, plus school starts again in September. I'm torn between wanting to never be home, wanting to be busy all the time and forget about anorexia, and then feeling tremendous amounts of guilt for not being present and for making something about me when I'm not the two people suffering the most!",BobJ48,"Sun,06/16/2019-4:35pm",Response moved to the bottom of the page.,iwanttolive,"Sun,06/16/2019-5:36pm","Hi.

I am really sorry for what you and your family are going through.  It sounds very painful.  Are you getting help for yourself to help you as you go through this with your sisters?  I had  various eating disorders for many years and am now in recovery and I have to say my sisters did not know how to cope or deal with me and my ""problem"".  I think it is good that you want to help your sisters but as BobJ48 said, you may need to reduce the amount of energy you are putting into your sisters, especially the one at home.  If someone isn't ready to get better and are being forced into gaining, there will be a lot of noise and fighting.  I never had to have family based treatment.  Didn't really exist when I was at my worst but even if they had this approach, I assure you, I wouldn't have cooperated.  This approach doesn't work for everyone.  It sounds as though your mother needs help understanding how to use this approach and not allow your sister, her daughter call the shots. That isn't how this approach is supposed to work.  It sounds like your sister is scared.  Most people with anorexia are terrified of gaining weight and need a lot of support while going through the process.  How is your sister who is in the hospital doing?  Do you think your sister at home needs inpatient?  Again, it is painful and so difficult watching loved ones go through this.  You also need support.   Especially if a lot of your parents attention is being put on your sisters you may feel ignored and angry and want your parents to see you as well.  It is not uncommon for siblings to feel this and rightfully so.  I hope you can find support and please, keep reaching out here for support.  I can tell you recovery is possible but it often times is a long road.  Recovery also can not be forced, it has to be something someone wants, and even then the process is difficult.  I wish you the best and will pray for you and your family.  Take care.iwanttolive and I am",orlandaws,"Sat,06/15/2019-5:08pm","first off, thank you for writing back. Just hearing from someone who understands feels amazing. I started the anti-depressants again because I knew that it would be a difficult time ahead, and I've had therapy in the past which has helped loads with my own personal issues with depression and anxiety. I go to family therapy at the hospital my sister is at, but I can't get say what I feel like I need to say with both sisters and my parents in the same room. now that I'm an adult, it's harder to get therapy quickly, but I'm on a waiting list. My dad is a lot better at managing his emotions and not giving into my sister at home. He and I work well together and he knows that I'm frustrated with mum's mishandling of the situation. Maybe together we can continue to talk to her about why certain aspects of her behaviours aren't helpful. My mum can get very defensive. ""How is your sister who is in the hospital doing? Do you think your sister at home needs inpatient?""
My sister in the hospital is making progress. She passed her restaurant family meal task today which means she's one step closer to being able to spend weekends back home again. I'm very proud of her! I think my other sister would recover quicker if she was inpatient, but that would be painful in its own way, and I want her to stay home. She's gaining weight even if she doesn't want to, sometimes it feels like theres two sides to her - the one who wants to go back to school and be her old self, and the one who's terrified of food and hates the whole family. thanks again for the kind words, I think this forum is going to be really helpful in the coming months",iwanttolive,"Sat,06/15/2019-7:50pm","""sometimes it feels like there's two side to her-the one who wants  to go back to school and be her old self, and the one who's terrified of food and hates the whole family"".  Very well stated and so very true.  The fear drives a person with an eating disorder, anorexia, to be people they never were, to say hateful things, lie, and self destruct because of the fear of gaining weight.  I used to find safety in being underweight and there are issues that cause one to turn to an eating disorder and initially it is used as a coping mechanism but then the disorder takes over and the individual no longer is in control but the disorder is.  There is a lot hiding behind the fear of gaining or food.  That is why therapy is so important.  Could you write a letter about how you are really feeling and read it at the next family session?  It is really important for you to  have a voice too.  And it may help reduce your own anxiety and depression as well.  I am glad to hear your other sister's outing went so well.   Yay!!!!  Eating disorders are so complex.  They are very difficult to treat and recover from.  But...recovery is possible.  I recommend you reading through some of the other posts on the other headings so you can see the challenges.  I am trying to help some talk more about what is underneath their fears and symptoms, to talk about their fears as this will help the recovery process.  I was afraid to get better because I was afraid to live in the real world.  Hiding out in hospitals as horrible as that was was easier than living outside of them.  Then God healed me.  I am free from all behaviors and addictions and am getting ready to start volunteering to help those who suffer with eating disorders.  My user name, iwanttolive is so true because for most of my life I wanted to die.  My life Scripture is I will not die but live and declare the works of the Lord.

It is important for the family to  be open and honest and while it may be painful in the moment it will hopefully help the family to heal and bring lasting change if all are open and talk about the difficult things in the family dynamics.

7,05/01/2019,I’mstuck-longpost,namuuu,"Hello, I’m new to this forum but I’m hoping that I could get some advice. My sister has been suffering from bulimia for about a year now. I’ve known about it for almost every day and I feel horrible. I don’t know what to do to help my sister. I should have stopped her earlier but I always thought that she’d be strong enough to stop on her own. It’s been a year now and it’s just gotten worse. I’m so worried about her health and I wish that I knew what to do to help her stop. I’ve tried talking to her but she just waves it off and says that she’s fine. My mother and I are trying to get my sister to agree to go to the hospital and talk to a therapist but she flat out refuses saying that it’s all useless. She already has cuts inside her throat, all that purging and laxatives have messed up her insides so bad that sometimes she has trouble breathing. My sister knows what bulimia does to the body but she’s become so addicted to purging she doesn’t know anything else.I know that my sister has always had a tough time with her body and after her major weight loss it just became worse. She believes that being skinny is the only way to be happy. She always tells people to love themselves but when I see her not loving herself it makes me want to cry. My sister and I have a lot of the same mental health problems and I went through a small period of purging as well, so I know how she feels to some degree but obviously I don’t know all because I have not been able to successfully talk to her about it.  I just want to be able to help her because I’m concerned about her body and her health. I feel bad sharing so many personal details about her but I really need some advice right now. I need to know how I should approach my sister about this, how I should talk to her, and how to get her to at least visit the hospital. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,05/01/2019-11:06am","Dear namuuu, welcome to the forums!

When the person feels that their behaviors are still benefiting them in various ways (even though they may know that the behaviors are toxic) it's pretty difficult to convince them that they need to take steps to change. So how do people define ""having a problem"" ?   The thought is that one needs to examine the effects that issue has on their life.   Social relationships, work and study, emotional and intellectual enguagment and flexibility - Negative  impacts on matters like that pretty much count as ""a problem"".  Not even counting the physical parts.  Perhaps your sister might agree ?Still, people can become so emotionally dependent on behaviors that they aren't really interested in changing.  of it they are beginning to have doubts, they can often feel that  ""I'm not sick enough yet"" or ""It's all that I've got"".  Thoughts which can keep people from fully confronting the issue and getting the help that they need. In any case, you might want to ask her to reflect on the different ways that her ED is effecting her life.   You're not going to be able to convince her yourself - These are conclusions she'll have to arrive at on her own.Another angle you might try is addressing the depression she is probably feeling.  She may not have mentioned depression specifically, but just to say, there aren't too many jolly bulimics.  She may not want to get therapy for her bulimia, but getting help for her depression might be an idea that she's more open to ?In any case, you're not alone in having these difficulties.

My sister does suffer from clinical depression, and she has an anxiety disorder. I do think that her anxiety disorder played a part in her developing an ED. My mom and I have tried multiple times to get her to agree to go see a therapist for her depression but she always refuses. The worst thing is is that she knows what her ED is doing to her health, she’s fully aware of it she just can’t stop. I just don’t know what to do at this point. Like you wrote, I won’t be able to convince her myself to have her stop but she’s become so emotionally dependent on her ED. She’s not trying to overcome it herself, and there’s nothing that I can do that’ll make her realize that she needs to stop. Honestly at this point I’d be more than willing to just force her to go to the hospital or therapy than have this continue for any longer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,04/17/2019,Needingsomeinsight,sistersforever,"My sister has an eating disorder going on three years. The thing is, she isn't sooo bad. That's not me in denial. She's definitely too thin, she needs to gain some weight. But she doesn't starve herself completely, nor does she throw up - she eats, and she's been doing so much better the past 6 weeks. She's been eating three meals a day (I think), and isn't as concerned with what she's been eating. But now, she has the chance to be admitted as an in or out patient (not sure which at this moment) at a facility, and I can tell she's unwilling to go through with it. She wants to enjoy her summer. I want that for her too. But I want her to get better, first and foremost. But I'm not even sure if this is the kind of treatment she needs. The menu they provide seems to be less than what she's eating now. She's gained some weight in the last 4 months. Progress is progress, but I can see how hard it is for her to gain weight, on a physical level. How long does it usually take for someone with an ED to fulfill proper weight restoration? I imagine its different for everyone. Do you think she should go in for treatment? Because maybe if she remains diligent, she can recover on her own, with the support of myself and my parents.I also think going to a therapist is extremely important for her, so she can confront the body image and dysmorphia she's been struggling with for a long, long time. However, she's seen two, both of which seem to not really help. I think its about finding the right person. Would you recommend she talks to someone who has recovered? Like a sponsor of sorts? Where could she find help like that? She's been to a group session, but they have restrictions on what they can talk about as to not trigger anything. I get it, but I think she needs someone she can really be open and honest with, and someone removed from her friend group and family.I'm just so unsure of everything. I don't know how to be there for her when she complains about the way she looks. I try not to engage with that kind of conversation, but I just never know what to say or what the right thing to say is. Often, she gets mad and upset no matter what I do. She says that I insinuate that she looks ""different"" aka fat, if I refuse to engage about how she looks, or if I tell her to remember that she doesn't see herself accurately. I try not to take it personally, but I've been having bad anxiety and panic attacks afterwards. I've been very supportive, and she knows that I'm always going to be there for her. I tell her how proud I am of her, and how this is just another battle that she will conquer. But it's taken a big f'ing toll on me. I just feel so bad. I am constantly thinking about it, and I'm so worried about her.Any insight would be really appreciated.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,04/18/2019-4:28pm","Dear sistersforever, we would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove specific numbers.

There's the eating and the weight of course, but the fact that she seems to have been able to persist with gaining for this long seems like the important thing.  One thing to remember though, often it doesn't take much for the person to fall back into their old habit.  Issues involving the theme of control can put a person back into a spin again. It's hard to say if she needs a program or not.  If she feels that it's not needed, and someone would have to force her to go, then that's something to take into consideration.  The control issue, you know ?  if it were her choice rather than someone else's, things would probably be better from the control angle. You are right about the therapist situation.  Finding someone who seems to ""get it"" is going to be important.  Talking with someone who's recovered themselves could help too. NEDA may offer something like that, and check their ""Help and Support"" tab above, as there seems to be some peer-to-peer forums she could access. "" if I refuse to engage about how she looks, ""  Good Idea !  You don't want to let her bait you into questions about appearance, because it's likely that nothing you say is going to be interpreted correctly.   ""You look fine"" actually means ""You look fat"".   If you say she looks thin, then you are only saying that to try and make her feel better, when what you really mean is that you think she looks fat.  There's no way you can win in conversations like this, so you're right about not allowing yourself to get involved in it !""But it's taken a big f'ing toll on me. I just feel so bad. I am constantly thinking about it, and I'm so worried about her.""   To be honest, this os how a LOT of people find themselves feeling, so don't get down on yourself if you find yourself feeling worried all the time. It comes with the territory it seems.  Frankly, people in your position often get therapy of their own, to help them to deal with the feelings they have, so if you find that these feelings are starting to get in the way of things, and are draining your energy in ways feel like they are taking a toll, it's reasonable to think about getting your own therapy to help deal with that.   Again, a lot of people do, so it's not something that's weak or silly to think about. You can keep writing here too, if it seems to help.Whatever the case, your sister is fortunate to have a caring person like yourself in her life.  Not everyone is always interested in understanding or being supportive, so you really are ahead of a lot of people in that regard.  xxBob J.",sistersforever,"Mon,04/22/2019-10:57am",I really appreciate you taking the time to respond in a such an engaged way.

9,04/10/2019,Afraidofothersgettingeatingdisorders,slowlyhealing,"About eight years ago my sister began suffering from anorexia. I was the first one to notice that she had a problem with food. Her disorder was a horrible strain on our family, as I'm sure is normal for families of eating disorder sufferers, and I think it had a big impact on my development as a teenager. Today though, thank God, she seems to be securely in recovery, and is at a healthy weight. However, despite the fact that my sister and the rest of my family seem to have moved on, I have struggled with this. I live in a different state from my sister and family now, and every time I visit them I find myself having to fight to not monitor every food my sister eats and every time she exercises. Even worse, I struggle to not monitor the food habits of basically all of my friends. Every time I see someone exhibiting an unhealthy attitude toward food, dieting, or exercising, I panic and want to lecture them on creating a healthy relationship with food. And unfortunately, most women in their early twenties don't have a perfect relationship with food, which means I am panicking a lot. Has anyone else experienced this, or does anyone have advice for how to cope with this?",BobJ48,"Fri,04/12/2019-2:36pm","Dear SH,Oh boy, it really does seem like you were traumatized by your sister's situation.   No doubt about it, home situations, when someone in the family has an ED, can really eat into everyone's life !  Some people manage to get through these situations OK, but some of us are naturally sensitive, and things can make a bigger impression on us than they seem to make on others.   Our sensitivity is not a bad quality, and can serve us in good ways in the future, but yeah, we can pay a price for it sometimes too. Because when we have a family member with an ED, it's like what can we do ?  Our sense of control over our environment goes right out the window, which as I'm sure you know, can be a truly unsettling feeling, and in itself can leave us with some real sensitivities.   Sensitivities that can be triggered again, later in life.    To an extent where if we see other people who we think might be heading in a bad direction, it can bring up those panicky feelings again.  At the risk of getting all Sigmund Freud about things, these panicky feelings may somehow relate to the  feelings of loss of control that you had  surrounding your sister. I suspect your remember how unsettling those feelings must have been. Also, we all deserve to get proper attention when we are young, but when someone in the family has a problem, often they are the ones who get all the attention, while  other children are neglected.  Stuff like that can really leave an impression on us too, particularly if we are of an intrinsically sensitive nature.  Almost like a PTSD sort of thing, you know ?And really, we can't just tell ourselves ""Oh don't be so sensitive"".   We are who we are, and it doesn't pay to beat ourselves up about that.At the same time, no one wants to find themselves in a situation where they are being triggered all the time, so I don't think  your concerns are silly at all. Everyone is going to say ""Oh you should get therapy"", but they may have a point.  This sort of stuff is disruptive alright, and it wouldn't hurt to try and figure out what's really at the root of it, and then go from there.   Therapists who advertise themselves as working with trauma and PTSD issues might be the ones to check out.   Not that you were physically abused or anything, but more the part about how disturbing events can really stick with us, you know ?   In ways that really can cause us some legitimate emotional disruption. BobJ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,04/03/2019,FindingtherighthelpforARFID,brilla,"My older sister (34) is suffering from an eating disorder and I am extremely worried about her.  She seems to be experiencing something closer to ARFID (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder), as she believes that she cannot swallow.  Her intake of solid food is non-existent and even swallowing liquids is difficult for her and takes a very long time.  This has been going on for 2 months and has resulted in her weight dropping extremely low.  I can go into all the long stories of ER visits and whatnot - but I am really just hoping that someone here might have experience with ARFID and found help.  I have been trying to find a place for her to go, like a residential program (we're in California).  Aside from the challenges of payment (she has medi-cal and I have yet to find a place that accepts it), many places focus on anorexia or bulimia.  I don't want to take her to a place where they can't help her, because I've already done that by taking her to two different ER's, and each time I feel like she loses trust in her family for taking her there.Does anyone have any advice for this sort of situation?

11,09/17/2018,Understandingmysister/howtohelpher,BotanicalCo23,"My sister has suffered with an ED and depression for many years and she hid it from myself and my family until a few years ago. She was admitted to in patient program for 3 months after she almost dropped out of school due to her ED and it initially helped. It has been a few years since she went to the facility or saw a therapist/psychologist regularly and since then, she has dealt with her ED and depression on her own and I would see her struggle but thought she was doing ok or knew how to handle her emotional upheaval from the therapy she received at the inpatient facility. I did not realize how much she was actually struggling until my girlfriend told me about the obvious signs, i.e. not eating consistently and being obsessive about what she ate, never communicating or being honest about how she was feeling, she would cry when we would go out to eat because she was not in control of her environment or what she could eat, and how skewed our sibling relationship was to an outside perspective. I did not recognize it but she often used me to deal with her emotional turmoil and I was always there to help her out and tell her everything was going to be ok. We never discussed anything serious nor did I ever confront her about her difficulties and not seeking help for them and I thought I was doing the right thing by being there for her. It is incredible difficult to tell her anything because I know how sensitive and emotional she becomes when we do talk about what she is struggling with and therefore I never confronted it. We also come from a family that doesn't talk about emotional issues and instead brushes them off and tries not to think about them and I am the only one in the family that she trusts talking to about her struggles. It has made both of us scared of confrontation and avoid difficult emotional discussions. I thought this was an adequate way to deal with her struggles, help her out when she was struggling, make her laugh and let her call/text me whenever she wanted, until it started causing problems in my relationship with my girlfriend. She would get angry and frustrated because I lacked the perspective to understand that my ""help"" was in turn letting my sister off the hook and leaving me emotionally drained and constantly worried about her well being. My girlfriend told me that I had to change something about my relationship with my sister because it was such a drain on our relationship and it wasn't a healthy way to deal with my sisters ED and depression. I decided, through my girlfriend's suggestions, to only talk to my sister once a week and let her know that she had to seek therapeutic or medical help because I couldn't always be there for her anymore. It was a drastic change to how we talked before but I felt that if I didn't do something drastic, I didn't think she would comprehend the magnitude of her issues and how important it is for her to seek help. It has been several months since I made this change and there seems to be little change on her part; I make sure to tell her she has to seek therapy or talk to someone else about her emotional struggles, even if it is a friend. I also make sure to tell her each week that she has to be more honest with me about what she is going through and if she has sought help. She is in school now and tells me that she is too busy or forgets to call counselors and I know it is her way of avoiding the issue. Each time we talk I confront her and she starts crying and shuts down and doesn't tell me much. I am just wondering what I should do? Do I not talk to her at all to let her know how serious I am that she seeks help? I am being too demanding when I ask her to seek help and not change much on my end? I told her that I will go to therapy too to help understand how to help her and change my way of dealing with confrontation and emotions. I want to keep talking to her but I don't know what to do and I am looking for help on how to talk to my sister and where to go forward from here.",iwanttolive,"Wed,09/19/2018-5:12pm","Hi.  I think it is great that you are trying to help your sister.sibling.  I think what you are doing is good but I would try to not always be telling her your sister that  needs to see a counselor, as you have already told her many times.  I think if you make yourself available on the day of the week you speak she may be more open to sharing if she isn't shutting down the conversation because of the mentioning of the need for therapy.  She knows what she needs.  No one can force an adult to get help.  Even a minor will not open up unless they want the help being offered.  So, you are doing a great job.  Thank you for caring for your sister.

You’re situation is very similar to mine.  My sister has been struggling and ED for at least 10 years but she hid it well from the family because she has other health concerns that mask when her ED is taking over.
How has the advice you received on this website and forum helped you?  I’m not sure how to speak to my sister without starting an argument every time we speak. She’s trying to control the way we communicate and my responses to her. She’s openly telling me I want you to speak to me this way not that way, but I don’t think it will help her. I feel like I need to be tough and somewhat motherly but she is telling me she wants me to keep it very light and not discuss her eating disorder.

If she seems to be making progress, then ""normal"" conversations that help her  remain in the world (rather than her withdrawing from normal day-to-day interactions ) can be of help, I think.  But if it seems like she's not getting better, and simply want's others to avoid pointing that out to her, so she can proceed with her ED unchallenged, then thats' probably another thing altogether. How does her attitude towards recovery seem to be ?   People can be mindfully aware of all the ""steps"", but if they are not making a good-faith effort to take them, and accept professional help when it's offered to them, then it's pretty easy for things to just stay the same.",Sissy,"Sat,02/23/2019-9:00pm","Hello BobJ48,
I’m getting mixed signals about her attitude toward recovery. Which is why trusting her is difficult for me.

Which when you think about how EDs are supposed to be about being in control…maybe you can see the conundrum they are up against .  Going to see a doctor or counsellor….they can feel that doctors or counsellors aren't going to tell them anything they don't already know, or devise other sorts of mental rationals for not going. So yeah - They can come up with a lot of reasons to avoid confronting their situation, kind of like we all can sometimes.    Because there's a part of them that can believe that there really is no hope for them.  So why bother going ? Which is not really true.  People can get better, but I think they need to admit that things really are out of their control, which can be a very hard thing to do.   For any of us, really. So yeah, at some point she's going to have to be willing to take some risks, if she's going to get better.  Seeing a doctor or ED specialist - Those are just the sorts of risks that she may need to take for herself, if she continues to find herself out-thinking her situation.",Feelsohelpless,"Wed,03/13/2019-8:25am","I am very new to this which is surprising because my sister is 65 years old. She has always been extremely thin since she was in her 20s but it wasn’t until a few days ago that I received a diagnosis from a team of doctors that she was suffering from both anorexia and bulimia and has been for about the past 30 years.My sister and I have been extremely close our entire lives and I feel like she is my soulmate and we can talk about anything. But her eating disorder is something that never even occurred to me. She would always tell me that she has a very high metabolism and she eats lots of food but she just couldn’t keep on any weight. I have to say that she is so painfully thin you can see her spine and bones protruding from her body.Our year ago she had major back surgery and had a 10 inch rod put in her back for what we all thought was stenosis of the spine. The surgery failed  and ever since then she went on a downward spiral mentally. She suffers from bipolar 1  and OCD. Over the years her mental illness has been managed quite well but the past year she has been in such extreme pain physically which led to her downward emotional spiral into deep depression.I always assumed that we could talk about anything because we always have. I come from a family of six siblings and she and I are the only two that are close. The other siblings are not close to her at all,  because my family has a hard time tolerating her personality based on her constant complaining about her physical pain and depression and also the fact that she alienated most of my siblings many years ago because of things she has said that were hurtful to them. But my relationship with her has always been unique in that we just get along so well and accept each other no matter what.  I must add that I am very close to my siblings and my mother so I feel fortunate in that way but I cannot talk to them about her because they have animosity toward her and so I feel helpless and without support even though I do see my counselor regularly.  I have bipolar and depression also and so we can always relate to each other and have always supported each other throughout the decades. We spent much time together and laughed and always had a deep connection to each other unlike any other I’ve ever experienced. We even know what the other is thinking without even saying anything.After her failed back surgery a year ago, she has been depending on me more and more  in times of crisis, which at times could be multiple times a day. At first I would try to help her by listening to her and hugging her and telling her everything would be OK but it got to the point where I started suffering emotionally because I couldn’t handle it anymore. I am a highly emotional person and I also have borderline personality disorder so I started struggling to the point where I was having breakdowns over her problems and realized that I needed to set boundaries for myself. So at the suggestion of my counselor I implemented some boundaries as far as when I was available to talk, consistently reminding her I was not equipped to deal with both her major problems as well as my own, gave her multiple contacts to call, reminded her to see her mental health doctors, etc. but she would keep crossing those boundaries or not doing any of the things I suggested. I also should add that she has been noncompliant with psychotropic medications over the years also because she claims that the side effects are too severe. So as a consequence to that she has lost many psychiatrists  because of their frustration with her.  So therefore she depended solely on me for crisis intervention on a daily basis and after six  months of that I literally couldn’t take it anymore so I set a boundary that we can have a relationship but I can’t talk about her issues anymore. Her issues being her depression, her financial  difficulties, her severe pain, etc. Nothing I ever said to her helped in anyway.  She saw multiple medical doctors and none of them had any answers.  Fast forward to about two months ago and it finally reached a point where  I had to reach out to professionals to learn how to cope with both loving her and being angry and resentful that she was putting me into the position of being her sole emotional support, which I am not equipped to do. I have my own issues and I also I am under the care of a psychiatrist and a counselor and do very well but I cannot handle someone else’s major issues as well as my own. Because my sister lived alone and was begging me to help her and telling me that she couldn’t eat because her throat was so irritated and acid was coming out and her pain was unbearable and none of her doctors were helping her and she didn’t know what to do anymore I finally had to reach out to the police department and the officer told me that whenever she had a crisis I needed to call for them to do a welfare check. So the first time that happened, a couple months ago, I did that and she was sent to a mental health facility but she quickly got out after 24 hours saying it was a horrible place and they didn’t understand her at all and it made things worse. Then she would go back home alone and the next day be in crisis again and reach out to me again and I would try to talk to her and give her suggestions and advice which she would not take.   So what ultimately happened is that in the last two months I have called to have a welfare check for her about four times and each time they would put her in a mental health facility and she would get out after a couple days and be just as bad or worse. It finally got to the point where the county had to intervene and she was placed  under their care through the court system and was required to go to doctor appointments and if she did not then she would be placed in a psychiatric facility against her will. She failed the first appointment but they did not check on her until four days after her missed appointment and when they went into her house they found her emaciated,  disoriented, with heart palpitations and found out she had not eaten in a week. So they placed her in the hospital to get her hydrated. After that she was placed in a locked facility for the past 10 days and I was not allowed any contact with her at all and it was breaking my heart in pieces because I just wanted to comfort her but I knew it was for the best.   The facility told me that this is their protocol because when someone is in such physical and mental distress it is imperative that they get acute care without the intervention of family members at the beginning so I understand that completely. I got a call finally yesterday from her team of doctors and they determined that they did a full evaluation and diagnosed her with  both anorexia and bulimia and it is extremely advanced. I almost fell on the floor in shock.  I didn’t know!!  How could I have not made the connection? On Friday they are putting her in a assisted living facility to get her stabilized physically and then after that they are putting her in a special facility in another part of the state that specializes in mental illness and eating disorders.  This was such a shock to me. I never ever considered over the last 30 years that she was anorexic. She always told me that she wished she would gain weight but said she was eating a lot of food (which I never saw her eat because she eats at home alone) and she felt terrible that she was so thin but that’s just the way it works and I took her word for it because my four brothers and my dad are thin also And over the course of the years I have seen them eat a lot and still remain thin because we do tend to have a high metabolism in our family.   To make a long story short, my sister is now going to finally get the help she deserves for her anorexia and bulimia in a place that specializes in those areas. I am holding out hope that she will improve enough so that she can get back home again eventually but I realize  it might take a long time or it may never happen. What I want people to take out of my comment is that even someone you were extremely close to for many years, you can be completely in the dark about the fact that they have an eating disorder.  This is the first time I have ever known someone with an eating disorder so it is all new to me  even though I have seen documentaries on the subject. So if anyone who has a loved one who is suffering from anorexia or bulimia or both, please know that it was nothing you did or didn’t do that may have prevented them from getting proper treatment  and there was nothing you could have done to fix them on your own. I realize now that what I did for her by continually calling for welfare check was the best thing I could’ve ever done for her even though at the time I thought I was being a monster.  No she is in a safe environment where they are starting the  process of treating her eating disorder. It will start with her admitting that she has an eating disorder and then it will go from there to actually treating the disorder itself.I am trying to stay very  hopeful that she will gain some weight and get better. I also know that the statistics show that someone her age who is been anorexic for three decades are not very good but I will never give up on my sister. My heart goes out to all of you who are  struggling to help your loved one. I have found that only professionals can help a person with an eating disorder and I am sharing my story because even though I had to take drastic steps to finally get her the help she deserves it was the only solution.  Trying to convince a loved one that they have an eating disorder and need help for it is futile. Getting professional help for them is key. Good luck to all of you and you are all in my thoughts and prayers.",iwanttolive,"Sun,03/31/2019-11:38pm","Hi.

You did an excellent job at explaining what you have been through with your sister.  You are correct in saying you are not to blame.  I understand you may feel ""how did I not know?""  But your sister was clever in lying and deceiving all.  You did the right thing in getting her help.  It is up to HER to decide if she is going to keep up with what she will learn in treatment. You are doing what is good for you in setting boundaries.  Boundaries are a sign of love believe it or not.  It forces the one who is ill to utilize the help that is there for her and will help keep your relationship healthy.  You are correct in saying you are not able to carry her and you.  As difficult as it has been for you to get her the help she needs, you did the loving thing, even if she is angry with you for it. I am really proud of you for loving your sister enough to do the difficult things you have done for her, and for yourself.  Please know we are here for you.  I am glad you posted.  You have been through a lot and as you said you are both older and it makes recovery a bit more challenging. I am 51 and after thirty plus years of suffering am now in recovery.  So it is possible.

I know it must have been difficult to call the police on your sister, and to know that they were taking actions that were likely traumatic for her.  That can't have been a comfortable time, I know. But as you've seen, she had reached a point where she was unable to take care of herself, and where others needed to take over.Hopefully things will go a bit better for her now.  If they can bring her nutrition up, people's thinking and mood often improves.  You may find that's the case with your sister. And really, BPD is no picnic, so it's really admirable that you've been able to look out for yourself in the manner you have. While it may not seem like it at the moment, I hope you'll be able to give yourself a pat on the back at some point for dealing with this situation in a manner that's finally brought your sister the help that she needs.   xx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,12/09/2018,Shouldworryaboutmy16yobrother?,worriedsister,"Hi everybody, My name is CC. I'm 20 and I live at college about half an hour away from my family. I'm worried about my 16yo brother. He's grown very tall and skinny in a very short amount of time. He was a chubby child, and my mom and his soccer coaches used to bother him about it and encourage him to work out more often and eat more healthy. He counted calories for a bit, lost weight, gained muscle and became a very accomplished athlete. They were kind of mean about it though, and I worry the criticism may have negatively affected him and made him obsessive. He doesn't often join us for meals, although I'm not home super often. He eats sort of secretly in the middle of the night, and if I ask my parents if he eats enough, they say he just eats in the middle of the night. This again, might just be what a teenage boy does. However he also is very sensitive about eating food. He will snap at me if I ask, even jokingly, if he eats enough. Over the last year, he has grown very thin and he exercises very often. He plays tennis very seriously and goes to the gym several times a week. This definitely could just be that he's growing very fast and wants to be fit. I know our mom feeds him a big breakfast (I haven't personally been up early enough to see if he eats it. I assume he does or my mom would be worried.) He completely skips lunch at school but usually (according to my mom) eats a big snack when he gets back. A few weeks ago, he actually passed out when he didn't eat an after school snack and fell down the stairs, which scared my dad. My brother, like my mom, passed out a lot as a kid from talking about blood or getting a shot, and I believe his blood pressure is low. Everybody has a different story. My brother claims he didn't pass out from hunger, but instead tripped and hit his head and passed out. My dad claims he had a seizure (which nobody has any history of, and my dad hasn't seen my brother pass out often enough to know what it looks like). My mom believes it was from hunger because he didn't eat all day and plays sports after school. Everybody was freaked out, but it hasn't happened again, and it just got kind of dropped. He doesn't seem to avoid certain kinds of food too much. He certainly doesn't like sweets as much as he used to, and he won't usually indulge in dessert. He obsesses a little over not eating too much junk although he definitely could afford to. Again, this could just be a health-conscious teen. On their own, none of these are entirely concerning (except maybe passing out, but he has always passed out very easily, and the reason is debated). However, this morning I found a bottle under the sink of knock-off weight loss pills that look too sketchy for my parents to have purchased them. When I asked my mom, she said that nobody had claimed them. Since my dad has no reason to hide them, they belong to my brother. I don't have any experience with eating disorders, and the evidence doesn't seem solid enough to bring up to my mom. On top of that, my parents are weird and uncomfortable about mental health problems (I hid my own seasonal depression and anxiety from them through high school and only found a therapist in college). If I bring it up to my brother incorrectly, he will become defensive. He and I have a pretty good relationship, but he sometimes shuts down about certain topics if he isn't in a great mood. I don't think he would confide in me if he were having self image problems. I will be home for winter break for about 5 weeks where I will see him every day, so I will be able to see whats going on. Should I be concerned or am I worrying too much? What should I do? Thanks for your help, CC",iwanttolive,"Tue,12/11/2018-10:16pm","Hi.  Thank you for posting and for caring so much about your brother.  There does seem to be some reason for concern.  I am not a professional, but I think he should at least be seen by a medical doctor, just to make sure everything is okay, especially since your dad thinks he had a seizure and the fact that he passed out.  Then the doctor can further investigate to see if there are any other possible medical problems, and will know if his weight is not in a healthy range.  I am sorry you had to go through struggles with depression alone.  That must have been difficult.  It is odd that he is eating at night.  He may be embarrassed to be seen eating.  There is a parent tool kit on the forum, and it may help you if you look through it.  Please keep us posted.  Anytime someone is concerned about a loved one, even if nothing is wrong, it is never wrong to seek help or ask questions and make sure that loved one is okay.  Denial is a huge part of an eating disorder.  So he may not answer truthfully.  That is part of the illness.  So it is okay to be asking questions and for being concerned.  I wish you the best.iwanttolive",Erin_Patricia1,"Wed,12/12/2018-1:18pm","Hi worriedsister,First off, I wanted to say welcome to the NEDA online community forums.

14,08/10/2018,11yearoldsisterisstartingtoshowsignsofaneatingdisorder,dlopez20522,"<p>hi, my name is diana and im 14 years old at the moment. my little sister told me just last night that she was depressed and had been eating less and less for a while. i didn't know to what extent, so i told her that the first thing she needed to do was tell me what she had eaten that day. she told me what she ate, i thought that was fine so i asked her if that's what her usual meals consisted of, and she told me no. she said that she usually eats only a little bit before going to sleep. to put some context into what i'm about to say, my little sister uses my mom's phone to text &amp; call her friends. today, i asked her how long she had had this problem with her weight. she told me that she had been bullied since 4th grade about multiple things, but mostly her physical appearance. eventually, she got to the point of staring at herself in the mirror and pointing out her flaws. the first thing she saw was her stomach. that's where it started. so, she let me read some of the texts she sent her friends, and the date that she told them about it was July 28th, 2018. her message read, ""for a few months now i've been dealing with something and i think i should tell you."" i'm worried that this has been going on for a long time and i don't know what to do. if anyone has any answers or suggestions, please please feel free to comment or reply. i need to do something, but i don't know what approach i should take.</p>",iwanttolive,"Mon,08/13/2018-9:08pm","Hi.  Is sounds like you have an amazing relationship with your younger sister.  It does sound as if she may be in the beginning stages of developing an eating disorder and if she is concerned enough to reach out to her friends and you I would want to suggest you tell her you are concerned and you need to talk to a parent of both if you can. Eating disorders are serious and life threatening and if caught early the early intervention can prevent a life time of suffering and serious consequences.  I would let her know you plan on telling a parent or someone you trust so she doesn't feel betrayed but I think she is asking for help and is scared herself.  The best thing you can do for her is to let someone know who can bring her in for an assessment and  get her help.  The best approach is letting an adult preferably a parent know and if nothing is done or it isn't taken seriously then let someone else know.  This isn't something that is easy to deal with and you are in a position that you may not want to be in.  But now that you know, you are right, you need to do something.  You sound like you love your sister. I am sorry she is suffering.  You too are young and to be in this position is difficult.  I wish you the best and hope that you let us know how things go.  Take care, I hope this helped you some.iwanttolive",BobJ48,"Tue,08/14/2018-5:06pm","Like iwanttolive said, it's great that you and her are able to talk in the ways that you do.  People can really feel alone with these sorts of feelings, so the more you are able to communicate with her, the better things will be.I was sondering : Are you talking with her fact to face, or are you guys texting each other?Sometimes it's easier for people to talk in a text.One other positive thing is that she seems to understand that this might be a developing problem.  Maybe not the eating part,right now, but the self-critical stuff with the mirror, and the bullying parts at least. This sort of insight can be important as well.As was said above, getting on top of this stuff *soon* will be important, as EDs can begin to imprint themselves on a person's brain pretty quickly, so the sooner these concerns start getting addressed, the less likely it is that things will begin to get worse down the line. And yeah, you'll need to tell your parents what's going on.  Even better would be if your sister could tell them herself.   Having said that, parent's don't always take these things seriously though, so that could be an issue as well, so it will be important that they take some initiative and educate themselves about the seriousness of the matter. If they just see it as some kind of silly kid thing, that won't be helpful either. Bob J",Lissylou,"Wed,11/07/2018-4:51pm","Hi diana, I hope you have been able to get your sister some help.

15,08/20/2018,Howtotalktomysister,rea_rea,"Hi! I hope you don't mind me coming to this forum as I'm actually the sibling with the ED. I need to talk to my family, but need some advice so I was hoping y'all could help give me some perspective. My ED started about 7 years ago, but I've been in recovery for almost two years with a few rough patches here and there. It started towards the end of high school and I did everything I could to hide it from my parents-I think they suspected something, but we just don't communicate in our family so nothing was said to me. My sister was away at school so I definitely don't think she knew anything was going on. I left for college and that's where my friends took over. When I had breakdowns or had to go to the hospital or anything they were the ones I let be there for me. I hate that I lied to my family about so much and hid everything, but I didn't want them to know because I was ashamed. Now that I truly feel I'm doing better I have to get this burden off my chest and tell them, but I'm still scared. Do you, as siblings, have any advice for me? I'm going to try to talk to my older sister first because she's actually a therapist so maybe she can give me some advice on how to handle my family as well, especially knowing their personalities. (Though I'm kind of scared she'll go all 'therapist' on me which has driven a wedge between us before just in normal situations so I really don't want her to do it now. So if there's someone that can relate and has any advice, I'm listening.) One other thing is she and I live a few hours away so I don't know how to meet with her because I really want to do it somewhere private, not at a restaurant or anything. Any suggestions there? Any advice really and I would be appreciative!! Thank you!!",BobJ48,"Tue,08/28/2018-3:30am","Rea-rea,Sorry your post sat here for a while.  I hope that you get to see this.You mentioned shame as the reason that you didn't want them to know when things were bad, and shame is' a pretty powerful emotion.  The idea that you could tell them now…that's really something I think.  This may sound like a dumb question, but do you know why you want to tell them ?   You mentioned that you guys don't communicate very well in your family, so might that have something to do with it ?  That you want to see some changes in that area ?Talking with your sister sounds like a good idea.  She probably has a pretty good idea of what you'd be up against with them.  With lot's of families ""no one wants there to be a problem"" so it still might be hard to get through to them. Also, parents are often defensive, and worry that they are somehow to blame for whatever issues their children might have, so that's something you might find yourself up against too. But yes, it would be reassuring if they could actually hear you.  That's something we always long for from our parents I think.When it comes to meeting your sister, perhaps you could ask her where she thinks would be good ?Even if none of them end up understanding what you've been through, or if they never fully appreciate the effort and progress you've made, you'll always be the one who knows it, and in the end that will always be the most important thing.   xx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,08/13/2018,Food/Control,Quietrock,"I've been dating and living with a girl for about a year with a severe ED. We knew each other online before so I was aware of her issues going in and have tried to be as understanding and helpful as possible along the way. As anyone with a partner who struggles with an ED will well know, it can feel sometimes like you are doing everything wrong or saying the wrong thing in the wrong way a million different times. It can be a slow process figuring out what triggers and what is helpful as sometimes these things can even appear to be dynamic in nature in some cases.A major issue in the house of course is food. Initially I would eat out a lot.. or not eat myself hardly at all and never around her as this seemed to trigger horrible binge / purge cycles. I don't want this for her of course so I reacted by making changes. But as finances struggled I found myself eating cheaper things like bread at home more. But anything food related I bought into the house was gone before I could eat it myself so I went along barely eating or eating out in cheaper ways. I then decided I would only purchase healthy items.. fruits, veg, eggs etc. in the home, so that if she takes them the night at least she's getting whatever nutrients she can from them before purging. So I did that lately, she didn't take everything but most of it. The food in the house not being enough of course, (despite her being in pain from fullness)she'd go out and eat more taking my money or money from our dual account and spend insane amounts over time. She was always very specific about what food she binges on and none of it is cheap. She doesn't work herself and I'm helping her get through school but we can barely pay rent because of this issue. Recently I resorted to making my own account and explaining that I understand she can't seem to help these urges but I can't have her spending our money for rent on this. Doing this has caused huge arguments.. accusations of mistrust etc. She thinks I'm being controlling etc. I decided recently to give her a certain amount of money for food a week she can spend how she chooses but she spent it all straight away and then had nothing to eat and started acting like I was starving her and being abusive. So I've just bought her food myself in reasonable amounts but she's been taking that and also borrowing off friends and family for the extra binges and hiding them. I really don't know if the way I'm approached things is the right thing to do, she is making me feel like a controlling monster and our relationship is really suffering for it. I guess I was just wondering how others with partners with a similar binge/purge ED handle food in the house and if anyone has better ways of dealing with this. I feel like everything I do or try is wrong and makes everything worse. :(Don",BobJ48,"Tue,08/14/2018-6:36pm","Don,Yep, the ""binge haul"" thing, as the girls often call it.  You can go on ED forums and see where people actually post pictures of all the things that they've bought to binge on.  They often have a pretty good idea of what they are up to, I mean. And really, many of them feel terrific amounts of *shame* about the amounts of money they are wasting.  I'm not sure if your GF has reached that stage yet, but it's reasonable to think that this might be behind much of the edginess and irritation you've noticed when you try and bring the matter up with her.As far as what to do is concerned, perhaps she might have some suggestions herself ?   Rather than you trying to come up with them, I mean ?Perhaps she's not reached the point where she would have some suggestions, but you never know. When it becomes a practical matter like this, it becomes hard for them to ignore the financial end of things, and even more unsettling for them  when they feel that they have no control over it. So you might want to see what she might suggest ?   Granted, such a question  might just upset her more ( in the moment at least) if you asked her in person, so you might send her an e-mail or something, and see what she says once she has some private time to think about it ?In any case, just some thoughts.

17,08/05/2018,Iamclosetoabreakingpoint,vital,"This will be quite long and lengthy just to note in advance. So my younger 15 year old sister has been dealing with an eating disorder for about two years now. It all started in the fall of 2016 when she tried taking her life and everything has been downhill since then. She suffered with the eating disorder right after that and for a while life was bad for her, that was until she became apart of a teen program which made her find a hobby and what me and my whole family thought was going to help her on a road to recovery. At the time she was 14 and became friends with a 19 year old boy there and he'd come to the house and it was just all really good for, but me and my mom and dad (i was 17 at the time 18 now just incase anyone wonders) would tell her you know its wrong to ever do anything right? And her response was always very reassuring and she told she would never and that doing anything with him would be gross and wrong, but unfortunately we found out they were a couple and she never would have told us if it weren't for my mom finding out :( so we were back to going downhill again. Unfortunately there was more stuff with him and multiple times of her running away and another attempt at killing herself and she was off to residential. During that time when she was gone I felt very guilty for loving the time she was away because we'd all be at peace. A few months later she told me how she had relationships with a bunch of guys in that teen program and they were boys who knew me and who were older then me and I just couldn't believe it. I had become a tattle tale and a snitch because when she would tell me things I would just have to tell my family because she puts herself in danger. She has become a huge liar and a very convincing one as well. She takes a lot of my things without asking me and thats created a huge strain on our relationship. I'll express to her how much I don't like that she takes my things and it got to the point my parents put a lock on my door. But everytime she takes my things she is so convincing and makes me believe it won't happen again so I don't lock my door and then she does it again and it messes with my head. A few examples would be her taking a very expensive make up product of mine and genuinely driving me insane because I can't find it anywhere and I thought i lost it for months and a week ago she gave it to me and apologized because she said it happened when she wasn;t eating a lot and couldn't remember hiding it, but she lies so much I don't know what to believe. And before I explain the next part I need to explain that I do smoke to help cope with anxiety and panic attacks sometimes and so one night I went to go get my smokes and it was gone and I was so shocked because I never ever forget to put it back in my bag so I got to her and I ask her if she took it and she tells me no and then I ask her if she'll check outside with me and she got very very defensive and told me no. Then she also told me and god I can't believe what a good actor she was but she said ""well you misplaced your makeup so you probably just misplaced your smokes."" And i went to my room so confused and then it just hit me and I went into her room and demanded she give me it back over and over and then she finally did. She's been smoking a lot and my parents keep catching her doing it and flushing it she has down the toilet and telling her no more! You are going to hurt yourself mentally if you keep using it to cope. Right now I just don't know what to do. My parents are on the verge of divorcing because this is becoming something they can't cope with together and I am so angry at my sister and I know my feelings are valid and I'm not alone but it's so hard to try and be there for her when she lies so so much and puts herself in danger with older men. I feel like it is all her fault and I feel like she loves having so much control over all of us. It is hurting so much. What has happened has made us cancel a huge family trip, is ruining my parents relationship, has made my anxiety and depression so much worse and it just sucks so much. I miss my old sister shes changed so so much and i miss the old me too. I just miss the happy family dynamic we once had and I can't even remember the good times anymore just the bad. My house just has a dark cloud around it and it is so sad here we are all so sad. And right now I have become a punching bag for everyone. When my mom has to deal with my sisters eating disorder and then my anxiety she can freak out on me a lot because her tolerance is wearing thin or if she gets into fights with my sister or my dad she'll freak out on me. This past weel has been the worst of me getting the short end of the stick. If anyone could help me or tell me I'm not alone or literally anything it would be appreciated.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,08/06/2018-4:20pm","Hi vital, welcome to the NEDA forums.

It is iwanttolive.  I am wondering how you are doing tonight?  I just had an opportunity to post.  Your sister sure has been through a lot and as I said, eating disorders affect entire families.  What are your interests?  What do you like to do?  I know the family situation is bad.  I feel for you.  The lying and stealing and all the behaviors that accompany an eating disorder are serious issues.  Have you considered counselling to help you cope with all that is going on and for your pain?   Are you in school?  What do you want to study?  I am in recovery from an eating disorder.  I suffered from anorexia and bulimia and binge eating.  Self harm, depression and anxiety.  Plus more. It was difficult on my sisters.  Some do not believe there is such a thing as eating disorders.  My roommate has no clue.  She can not understand how someone could deprive themselves of food to the point of death.  Your sister has mental illness.  It doesn't make it any easier to deal with her behaviors but may help you to understand that her mind isn't working right.  Some of these things she is doing she right now may not be in total control over.  Initially the malnourished brain can not think clearly.  Once it begins to have nourishment on a regular basis, we become more able to make choices.  Those choices are not always the healthiest.  Then comes the wanting to get better.  It is a very scary decision and requires a lot of work.  There are many reasons people are afraid to get better, to let go of the eating disorder.  For me I was so afraid to grow up. Afraid of being assaulted.  I still have some of these fears but realized that I have to face them.  It took a long time.  I am facing them now and consider myself recovered.  God did some miraculous things in my life two months ago and has been working in me for several years.  Slowly I let go of the behaviors until now I don't even think about using any of them anymore.  But for you, you need to take care of yourself.  You may need some distance for a while from your sister, but try not to let it ruin your relationship.  My sister's never really understood and stayed away from me.   I have never really been close to most of them.  It hurt my friendships, the few that I had.  The eating disorder stole my life from me until recently.  I have taken it back with Jesus help and my parent's and my therapists help.  I just want you to know you are not alone and for you to keep posting as much as you need to do.  There is no need for guilt for how you are feeling.  Your feelings are yours and are valid.  Take care, iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,08/01/2018,littlesistercomingtovisit,jessib,"Hi everybody,
I have just been informed by my mom that my younger sister (she's 18) is suffering from an eating disorder, she severely limits her food intake and has been isolating herself from her friends and what not. i do not live at home with my family so I have not actually experienced this first hand, however my sister is coming to visit me for 10 days starting next week and I am really worried about how to help her. I want my living environment to be as comfortable for her as possible and I don't want her to feel any pressure from me during meal times, however I will likely be doing most of the cooking. I also live in a very unique food-hub so prior to my knowledge of her ED I had booked a few reservations at neat little places for us.
Basically I am just wondering what I can do to best support her and if I should keep these restaurant reservations, etc etc. I am totally out of my league in dealing with this so any advice would be greatly appreciated!!
Thank you so much",iwanttolive,"Sun,08/05/2018-5:26pm","Hi.   It is kind of you to be wondering how to best help your sister.  I am sorry she is suffering.  Maybe if you read on NEDA web site on the information pages about how to help loved ones, and just familiarize yourself a little on eating disorders in general before she comes that will help you some.  Also, don't be afraid to ask your sister what she is comfortable with.  Ask her if she wants to eat out or not.   I wouldn't cater to her every desire if she isn't eating much.  I would try to be as normal around food as you usually are and then ask her if she wants anything in addition to what you have already planned.  She may be anxious about the whole food deal with three meals a day.  But I would still plan for the three meals.  If she chooses not to eat and wants to excuse herself I wouldn't try to convince her beyond an Are you sure? and then leave it at that.  That is just my suggestion.  Someone else may think differently.  I wouldn't mention anything about how she looks.  Like you look good or something along those lines.  Say something about what she is wearing or her hair or something neutral.  Ask questions that don't revolve around the eating disorder unless she brings it up.  Ask how school is going, what she is doing with her summer, work, those kinds of things.  If she wants to discuss the eating disorder and she feels you are open to talking with her, she very well may.  Ask her if you can ask her questions.  Let her be in control of the whole eating disorder stuff.  I would make yourself available to her but wouldn't try to pry or push her to talk if she isn't ready.  Meal times may be awkward, but try to be calm and as easy going as you can.  Since you don't know much about where she is at it makes it a little more challenging.  I hope this helps you some.  Just be her sister.  Treat her as you always did.  Ten days is a long time.  Post here as you need and let us know how things are going.  I didn't see your post before today, Sunday.  So sorry for the delay.  I wish you the best.  It is good to see how you care about your sister and want her to be comfortable.  Take care,iwanttolive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,07/18/2018,"Goingtoa4yearcollege,but..",maddieebobaddiee ,"Hi everyone!! My name is Maddie, and I’m 23 years old. My sister has been dealing with an eating disorder for a while now (she’s 23 like me) and her problem really started when she attended a university. I currently go to a community college, but I’m going to attend a 4 year university as a visiting student this fall semester. I know this might sound crazy, but I am really worried that something bad might happen to me, just like it happened to my sister with her eating disorder. I really wanna go to experience something new and make some new friends, but I’m very afraid. Thanks for listening :)",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/18/2018-7:55pm","Welcome to the forums, and thank you for posting.

I am glad you posted.  I am really sorry your sister developed her eating disorder while at college.  Or at all for that matter.  Seeing her suffer has to be difficult.   I know you know this but you are not your sister and her experience does not have to by yours.  I don't know what happened to cause her to develop the eating disorder.  Maybe she wasn't ready to go away.  But you are and you want to go and explore the freedoms of being at a four year university, making new friends and taking on new challenges.  Try to focus on all that awaits you. All the new and exciting experiences you will have.  I hear the concern and the fear.  Try talking about it with a friend if you feel comfortable.  Write about your fears and then go out to the university and live.  Try not to allow the worry to grow and become greater than it is.  Fear has a way of doing that.  Your experience does not have to be what your sisters was.  You are in two different places.  Two different people.  I know you know this.  But I don't want to minimize your feelings.   They are real.  If you work through them before you attend, hopefully the fear will be smaller than it is now and it will be something in the back of your mind instead of in the front.  I hope this helped some.  I want you to enjoy your life and know that because your sister got sick it doesn't have to happen to you and you do not need to feel guilty for enjoying your life.  It is okay to be well.  It is healthy for you to move on with your life.  You can still be there for your sister if you want to be, but go ahead and live your life.  It is your time to fly.  iwanttolive",livroseclarke,"Wed,07/25/2018-11:55pm","I've been there, just in an opposite situation. I would probably be closest to the situation of your sister in this case. Since my sister and I are genetically related, that developing an eating disorder is a risk for the both of us. I suffered first, and, unfortunately, my sister is currently suffering as well. My best suggestion, seeing that you seem to understand how drastically your sister's life has been affected by her ED, is to take note of these disadvantages each time you might feel certain triggering thoughts (which might be helpful to do some research on to recognize). It's more difficult to notice your own symptoms and match them to that of an ED than to see them in another. If it's helpful, begin to log your food intake along with how you feel during each time you eat so you can notice these changes in your mood as you eat.
What I try to remember when I slip into my old habits is of how much I am enjoying in my more balanced life without such stress over food versus what my fatigue and anxiety prevented me from doing while I had my eating disorder. It's a difficult concept to grasp without having experienced it, but as I mentioned previously, comparing your sister's post-ED and pre-ED life might be helpful in this way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
