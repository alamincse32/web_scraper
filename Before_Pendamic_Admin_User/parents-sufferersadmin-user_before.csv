0,bracal,08/17/2019,Mother grieving child lost to ED,"I am the mother of a 20 year old young woman, who was at one time vibrant and alive, unafraid of anything! A year ago she made a serious suicide attempt that brought to light the depth of her eating disorder, substance abuse and other mental health issues, depression, anxiety etc. She was hospitalized then we used the only leverage we had (her dance training program funding) to force her into a 30 day residential treatment. She hated it but complied with treatment recommendations because she wanted to dance. She got out of treatment and went into a step down program and continued an intensively outpatient regime for another 6 months. She resisted and hated it the entire time. Long story short, it kept her alive and now fast forward, she has graduated her preprofessional program and has come home while planning for her next adventure. We moved in the middle of all of this and she is isolated here. She just started a job and is saving up money to relocate to a big city where she can pursue her career.  Living with her has been exhausting. My mental health is a mess, I'm crying all the time, feel lonely, lost, powerless and hopeless, am depressed, anxious waiting for the next episode or suicide attempt (she has days where she cant function and just wants it to be over- I talk her off the ""ledge""). A very big part of me feels horrible because I just want her to leave, to move out and get on with her miserable life somewhere that I don't have to bare witness in this push/pull dysfunctional relationship. She does not want help. The less she eats, the less I recognize her. This is not the child I raised. I barely even like this person. It is the hardest thing in the world to feel this way about your own child. We almost lost her and here I am wanting her gone, I never imagined I'd feel this desperate.I don't know how to help and I no longer know how to take care of myself in this situation. My husband is equally struggling but the way he deals with it pushes us away. Our marriage has been impacted as has our relationship with our other adult son. I truly feel like I am grieving for the child (or maybe my ideal of that child) I lost a year ago. I'm not really sure what I am looking for other than an opportunity to share these words out loud.Thank you for reading,",_admin_moderator,"Mon,08/19/2019-4:36pm","Dear bracal, we are very","Dear bracal, we are very sorry to hear that your daughter has been struggling.

1,dontknowwheretoturn,01/02/2019,Orthorexia,"I'm in a place I never thought I would be.  My daughter has a disease which I just don't understand. I'll give you the basics and see what advice you can give me.  I'm 100% in her corner, I just don't know whether to press issues or stand back.My daughter is a Div 1 athlete.  She has been diagnosed with orthorexia.  (only eats clean foods).  This started in HS. She is now a Junior in college.   It started with only wanting to eat healthy foods.  The sport was an easy coverup (as she explained to us recently).  We truly had no idea.  She's maintained a fairly good weight throughout all of this.  Things took a bad turn this past summer and we finally strongly encouraged her to see the athletic department's nutritionist who in turn referred her to the psychologist.  She's been going to therapy for about 5 months.  She's open with us and is really trying.  She has gained some weight and does look better (her eyes and face aren't so drawn and tired looking).  Her athletic performance shockingly hasn't been affected by this disease.  I don't know how it couldn't have been but she had a great season this past fall.  My husband and I were looking for signs of lack of fitness and strength but she was the most fit of any athlete on the field and one of the strongest.  So, she's been home for the first time for an extended amount of time for the first time in a couple of years.  She's eating a fair amount of food but no foods which are outside of what she considers healthy. Should I be pushing this or letting it go?I know that she had a really rough time with her ED when she first came home but seems to have settled in a bit better as the break has gone on.  But still not eating anything outside of her ""clean diet""  Anyone have any experience with this?  This is how the whole ED started.  It got bad with restrictions and excessive exercise this past summer but while I wouldn't say she's eating to excess, she's still not eating a lot.  Excessive exercise is difficult to moniter as she has a program that she needs to follow from her coach over break which is pretty intensive.  She is open with us and is on medication.  It's difficult to know if she's making progress or if she's just holding steady .",_admin_moderator,"Thu,01/03/2019-12:43pm",Hello dontknowwheretoturn and,Hello dontknowwheretoturn and welcome to the forums!

2,Ladysen02,09/22/2019,Mistake to admit?,"I am having a lot of trouble wrapping my head around my daughter being admitted to residential. She came to us one night amd said she needed help and showed us that she had started cutting. We noticed this summer that she seemed to be thinner but weren't too alarmed since she was so active this summer. End of August,  she passed out on the toilet and admitted to her therapist that she had been restricting for a while. We contacted the recommended facility who had her doctor order tests. They determined she needed residential treatment.  She dropped a significant amount of weight in a short time. Her problems up to this point had seemed centered around anxiety and stress from issues in her life. Now she's been in the facility for 3 weeks, it seems she is worse. I am so worried that i made the wrong choice and that she is learning more bad things than healing. My academic head says she needs to be there but my emotional brain wants to take her home. Has anyone had these worries? Did we admit her too soon? Am I making her worse by being admitting her?",_admin_moderator,"Sun,09/22/2019-10:33pm",Edited post,"Hi Ladysen02, your post has been edited to comply with NEDA’s community guidelines https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/forums/community-guidelines.

3,rawlih,02/01/2020,Refeeding programme - cannot get my daughter to do it,"My daughter attended an assessment at Eating disorders unit on Thursday. They said that her physical health is a cause for concern and that she needs to do a refeeding programme. They then gave us a sheet showing how she should increase her intake. Basically said "" make her eat it"". clearly this is not happening as she has an eating disorder!!!!!All that has happened is that she is even more conscious of what she is eating and so consequently decreased her intake. I am not at all convinced that this is the right strategy. They have also said that she cannot do any exercise or go to school. This is having an extreme effect on her mental health and I now feel that things are so much worse than when we asked for help.Does anyone else have any experience of how they were helped at the start of this process? They have basically said to me - make her eat it  as it's her medicine or we will take her into hospital. If I could make her eat I would not be in this position.She does not believe that she is that ill.Please help us to know what to do. Should we just allow her to carry on as she is now for a few days until she can be seen again on Tuesday or continue to force the issue knowing that it is making her eat less.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,02/03/2020-2:10am",Edited your post,"Dear rawlih, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove mentions of numbers, which are not allowed on the forums.

She will only eat dinner and will not eat anymore than X calories for the dinner. She purges after she has binged. I immediately took her to the doctor who confirmed she lost X pounds in 2 months.  She is naturally a thin girl.  The doctor referred us to a psychologist but the waiting time is crazy.  She is always very tired.  On a daily basis I speak with her about healthy eating habits and we make healthy meals together.

8,Andrea84,01/19/2020,13yr old daughter refusing to eat,"My 13yr old daughter has been having issues at school, with an ex friend targeting her about her weight, making comments, calling her names. Last september she stopped eating as she said she wasnt feeling well. Her blood sugars dropped and she was admitted to hospital. The drs put it down to viral as they couldnt find anything physically wrong (all her symptoms were things they couldnt really check-headaches, dizziness, blurred vision). She refused the syrup to get her blood sugars higher, and the nurses had to be quite firm with her. She eventually started to drink it.
All seemed to calm down at school for a while. Then before christmas quite a bit of food was vanishing and she denied it was her. I have found all the wrappers under her bed.
The girl has started making comments again now and my daughter is now refusing to eat. In the last week she has been eating very little. Another incident on friday happened and she is now refusing to eat anything at all. She is barely drinking. I took her to hospital last night. She was refusing but we managed to get her there. Her blood sugars are low, hands and feet are cold, headaches and tiredness. They were going to admit her but decided to let her home and said to monitor her, if she faints or goes dizzy to take her straight back, and to make sure she drinks as she isnt drinking enough. Shes now refusing water too. She is so emotional then switches to really angry. Its like theres just a shell of her at the moment. I just dont know what to do. The more i try and push even just drinking she refuses even more. She says it makes her feel better when she doesn't eat.

9,SLundbergRoth,01/19/2020,Toddler with an eating disorder and insurance road blocks,"Hello!
I am new to this forum, new to parenting, and very new to learning how to support my child through his struggles.
My son is 3.5yro and we've been fighting with him over meals for about 3 years now.
He recently was seen by the CHOP feeding and swallowing department and it was recommended that he be enrolled in their intensive feeding therapy program.
He often shows extream behavioral issues at meal times, including vomiting the moment non perffered foods get past his lips and forcing himself to vomit if pushed to take a bite of something he doesn't want.
He currently only eats about 12-15 foods in total.
Everyday feels like a struggle for him, and as bad as it sounds, I was very relieved that someone verified that he needed help.
However, it turns out our insurance company wont cover the therapy and there is no way we can afford it.
I feel defeated.
We are still fighting for them to cover it, but I dont have my Hope's up.
I feel ill equipped to handle this on my own and am looking for any advice on resources to help my little one.
I might also mention that he has Ketoctic Hypoglycemia, so his aversions to food and his unwillingness to eat do effect his overall health as well.
And it was recommended to us, that we should enroll him in play therapy to help him with some general everday anxiety.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,01/20/2020-2:51pm",NEDA Helpline,"Hi SLundbergRoth, we want to make sure you know the NEDA Helpline is an option to talk about finding resources.

10,welostdaughter,01/09/2020,Our daughter lost the battle,"Hello,
I am new to this site and only found out about it through the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC). I never really cared about what to donate to until now. We lost our daughter just a few weeks ago from complications with her bulimia. She had been fighting valley fever for about a year and a half and due to being malnourished, her body could not fight it anymore. A healthy person can usually fight it off in about 2-3 months.
She was a beautiful 27 year old girl who was very talented at writing and drawing. She lived with us several times over the years and we had just moved her in to her own apartment in November. She has been fighting this disease for about 9 years. We have had her in many treatment programs over the years, none of which she liked but she knew it was necessary. She did have dreams of success and had dreams of becoming a mother. We had those same dreams for her.
My main reason for leaving this message is to help people become aware about how serious this disease can be. I am still mourning her loss and still in disbelief that I will never see her beautiful face, hear her witty jokes or her laughter, enjoy her big hugs, or get her birthday cards (which she always told me that I was the best dad in the world and I was her hero).
My wife and I are going to start an awareness group and start fundraising campaigns to shed light on the whole issue, in the name of NEDA. We were always just focused on her and if we had started something like this sooner, my daughter would not have liked that kind of attention.
For all the parents out there that is dealing with a child with a eating disorder, I want to encourage you, plead with you, not to give up and always try to get your children the help they need.

13,dtraynor34,08/19/2019,"""Goal weight"" during AN recovery","My 21 yr old daughter was in residential treatment for 10 weeks for anorexia.  She was moved down to PHP and after 4 weeks moved back up to Residential as they did not see the weight restoration they wanted in PHP.  First, this was a very emotional ""hit"" in the process - she was really progressing in all aspects of PHP except weight.  The therapy team praised her for her participation and dedication to recovering. She is now back to how she was when we first started treatment - depressed, defeated, and miserable with the return to the restrictive/controlled environment in Residential.  And, there is no set plan for moving her back out of Residential - when they think ""it's appropriate"" for her.  The main driver for moving her back to residential is her weight compared to the ""goal weight"" they set for her.  I have asked how they determine goal weight with no good answer (I think it's age, height, gender charts) and how goal weight plays into the recommendations around level of treatment.  We understand that weight restoration is so important.  She has gained X lbs so far in this process.  The goal weight they have given me seems high -- and it would require her to gain another X lbs.Has anyone had to question goal weight? Did your child have to reach full goal weight in order to be moved up in treatment levels?  Do they set goal weights high because they know there will be some weight loss upon returning to PHP, IOP, etc.?We really don't want to discuss weight (the number), it should not be the focus.  But, in our case, this is the only reason they can give us for the return to residential with no real understanding of how/when her weight will be at the right number to move back to PHP and eventually IOP.Any insights are appreciated.  This is so hard -- and I am so extremely proud of my daughter for the progress she has made.

14,[email protected],09/13/2019,Daughter 5th admission ,"Hi
I feel I need some more support so I’m here. My 29 year old daughter has been suffering with restrictive anerexia, PTSD, anxiertu and major depressive disorder for 9 years. She lives in Baltimore 90 minutes away. She is being admitted Monday back to a treatment facility for the 5 th time. I’m so depressed and upset. Twice she had to be forced to treatment by her therapist via the ER. This to she has been out of PHP for 4 months. She got a job part time as a contract therapist. She got her masters in social work while this has been going on. It was contractual so she was able to keep her Medicaid and disability. Just to back up she developed the ED sophomore year of college. Spent time inpatient twice but did manage to get her batchlers degree. Came home after graduation and had another stay. She is also suicidal. She went to Baltimore for a job and died pretty well. So well she was goof to study abroad a semester when she enrolled for her masters. Since June of 2016 it’s been awful. She has lost her friends. Her sister has nothing to do with her. Added to that her sister who is 4 years younger is living a charmed life. Bought a house, engaged etc. so we keep the same cycle for almost 3 years. Get sick stay in the treatment facility for months go home and then after a few months back in. This time she is telling me her out patients team knows she is only staying a week and will let her see her clients. I’m calling BS on that one. Probably saying whatever they need to to get her back in treatment. She won’t go anywhere else I’ve tried and she is limited with Medicaid.  She won’t listen to me anyway. I have no control at all. She isolates herself so I won’t know how bad she is. She is very concerned about my anxiety around her hospital stays. When she has been admitted it’s a shit show. She has 12 reptiles and a cat. We have gone in and taken care of everything.  I’ve learned from my support group not to take over and let her call the shots. I’m doing a good job this time but inside I’m falling apart. She is going to lose her job. It took a lot of convincing to get her to find a job because she didn’t want to abandon her clients. I can’t imagine they will keep her if she missed more then a week it two. I know all these details I should not be worrying about but I can’t help it. What’s goof to happen whensje loops her job, who will take cate of these pets etc etc. I know I should be happy sjebis seeking a higher level of treatment but is this ever going to end. I have health problems now. I’m trying to help my other daughter plan a wedding. We have financial issues from helping her.  Our friend and family are not any support anymore. They been there done that. We are alone  my husband tries but .... she won’t move back here and o no options. The ball is in her court and I have no confidence in her treatment. I’m worried she will kill her self over the weekend with the admission coming up Monday and I can’t do a thing. I feel like I’m falling apart.

15,bennys,08/23/2019,Daughter with depression and now ED,"Reading thru other posts I felt I was looking at a mirror and reciting their words to myself.  We have a 19yr. daughter that we just recently found out has anorexia.  We had to face and battle depression, 2 attempts of suicide and social anxiety and now we get to add to it an eating disorder.  So we have a support system somewhat in place which is helpful, but unfortunately our daughter doesn't take ownership of things enough to keep the support going.  We can keep her in her counseling sessions (which is a positive) but when it comes to staying with the needed meds she won't stay on them regularly and take them unless we push her, and as of recently she has neglected staying active with her Psychiatrist visits and therefore fallen out of ""the system"" and has to be reestablished as a new patient.  So now she is out of meds and we have to wait for an appointment to get into a psychiatrist to get her new prescriptions.  This of course all happens at the same time we've found out about the issues with eating. The first few days of things were scary and positive at the same time.  It was great having her actually come to us with this (which her therapist had convinced her to do).  We felt like she was finally taking ownership of things in her life.  We felt we could help her along the way and monitor here a bit more and get her on track for eating.  Unfortunately what we've found as many of you know, is it just isn't that easy.  Since the initial discovery of it till now, things have gotten no better and we are learning that she has absolutely no interest in changing.  Between the depression and the ED she just doesn't care.  We've talked with her about getting into a nutritionist and been met with the comment of ""whatever, it doesn't matter what they tell me I won't listen and want to keep losing weight"".  We daily force her to eat whatever we can, and get met with resistance every step of the way.  We, as parents, have become just plain tired.  We've battled the depression and suicide (and cutting to make things a bit more complicated) for the last 6 years and felt that up till about 6 months ago we had some success keep her in a good place. Now this creeps up on us.  In the past I've been able to look out and see through it all and know ""we will get through it"".  This is the first time I have to say I can't see the end here.  I've become frustrated!  Between her actions in the past and now this I feel like we have our family life revolves around her.  We have two boys whom we've unfortunately had to push aside at times and ignore.  So I get frustrated, then feel guilty that I'm frustrated with her and the fact our lives can't be ""normal"" (whatever that is anymore) which then leads to me be mad at her and myself.Not even sure what I hope to get with posting this (first time posting on any forum for this).  May be just a great place to vent.  It's hard because there may be support out there but when crap hits the fan, it'sjust you (and your spouse) to wad thru these waters.

17,brutus94,05/09/2019,Parent struggling to stay positive,"I am the father of a 19 year old with an ED for ~3 years.  We have been through ups and downs, many counselors, treatment options, a 10-day hospital stay, etc.  We have been through all the ""you have to try this"" and ""go to this counselor she is great"" and whatever other advice that friends and family have to offer.  We have been through the barriers where people (friends and family) have overcome their fear of confronting my daughter with their concern for her health and just come right out to tell her ""I know what you are struggling with, and I think you need help"".  We have had talks about short and long term health concerns (bone density, heart health, hair loss, inability to have kids, and death).  There have been so many times where I have thought ""this may finally be the thing that wakes her up and makes a permanent change"", only to have another setback or have her push away and insist on doing things her way.She is an amazingly smart kid.  And she is motivated (and stubborn) like nobody I know.  She has dreams of being a traveling nurse and helping people.  She has excelled academically in her first year of college.  She has knowledge, resources and support.  But in this particular area of her life, it is just not working.  The best way I can describe it is she is 100% committed to a course of action that is resulting in compromised physical health.  Logic and reason do not work.  She is, however, willing to admit there is a problem that requires attention.  But making progress is just so incredibly slow, and sometimes no-existent.  And she is determined to do it her way.  She agrees to go to counseling, but claims it does not help and as a result she fakes her way through it so at least she can say ""I'm trying"".  The phrase ""I'm trying"" is very frustrating for me to hear, because I can instantly think of 5-10 things that she will refuse to try.I cycle through emotional stages of hope, acceptance, frustration, sadness, depression, and anger.  My wife and I are tired.  I often feel like the best thing I can do is to keep my mouth shut and avoid lashing out in anger and frustration (I have learned my lesson that this does not help, and any temporary feeling of relief in blowing off steam is soon overshadowed by feelings of guilt and shame).  Most recently, we have told her that our financial assistance for college will end if her health does not improve.  It makes me sad to think she may miss out on an amazing, successful, and happy life.  She hates the idea of spending all her money on college, and she absolutely won't quit, so I am HOPEFUL once again that we have created a situation where she has to decide what option she wants to choose.  I have come to realize that nobody can help her unless she decides she wants the help.  I wish this was wrong, and correct me if I am.

18,cwb124,06/03/2019,10 year old developing eating disorder,"HI folks, new here.  Wife and I have a 10 year old son who starting around age 4-5 became VERY picky.  He used to eat the pureed vegetables we fed him as a baby and most everything else and then the wheels fell off.  He has cut his food down to a very few things.However over the last couple years he's developed what I must consider a serious eating disorder.  When nobody is awake yet or when he doesn't think anyone is around, he'll raid the cabinets for any food to be found. While this probably isn't entirely abnormal, some of the things he finds to eat perhaps is. We have recently discovered that he has pillaged out baking cabinet. Stuff that is barely edible on its own, he has cleaned out.  Whenever we go to the store, he sneaks money in his pocket and tries to buy snacks from the checkout isle.  When he discovers that we are allowing him to have a treat he gets almost anxious that he will miss out when obviously there's enough for everyone to have one.  I just see very odd eating behavior from him, and he's extremely difficult to feed.  Won't try ANYTHING new.  He's not overweight now but the way he's going if he keeps this up, he'll have serious health problems.  I am not sure what to do.

20,staypositive,05/25/2019,How Can I Learn to Communicate Better with my Daughter after sending her to Treatment?,"We finally pulled our 16 year old from school and put her into a day program. She is mad. I betrayed her. I promised I would not put her in to a place she did not belong. She needs to be there. She doesn't see that. Somekids are severe there. She's not. She eats, now. She needs to learn how to eat enough to gain and maintain and how to have a healthy relationship with food..not the one that she believes is healthy. When people say ""eating disorder"" it's upsetting to her. I try to explain that ED encompasses a lot , not just not-eating. There are psychological components, behavioral..etc...and what she shows her parents is her distain for what we have ""to"" her...she can't see what we have done ""for"" her. She believes that she can just eat more. Exercise less. She is with drawing from friends because she doesn't want to explain where she is and why she's not at school. We love her so much and want to support her, we hope that she will understand, but she can't now.

21,molly123,05/23/2019,New to this ,"Hi, my 15 year old daughter has been struggling with bulemia for about 7 months now. She came to me about two months ago asking for help. Admitted that it was getting out of control and she was scared. After going to numerous psychologists, we finally found one that specializes in eating disorders and she has started therapy (once a week). We've only been twice so far so I haven't seen any changes this soon.  I think she uses behaviors at least 4 times a week if not more. She uses behaviors right in front of me,  she doesn't hide her disordered eating. It is so heartbreaking when I see her doing it,  especially when I know what she will do next after the eating is done. I get so frustrated, sometimes I just want to tell her to please stop eating, but I know I shouldn't do that. Another problem is that her best friend has an eating disorder(sometimes I wonder if she has a lot to do with what my daughter is going through now) the friend was self harming back during the summer and I found out my daughter had started to self harm around Thanksgiving. She did that for about two months.  That's when the eating disorder started. Her friend also convinced her that smokimg would help with her anxiety and food cravings. I found out that my daughter had bought one from a kid at school and has been using it for about a month now. Is it wrong of me to wish that this friend would move to the other side of the world??

22,MurphysLaw,04/23/2019,Anyone else in a holding pattern or plateau,"My daughter is 17 and struggled with an ED for almost 2 years now.  She was never hospitalized but lost significant weight over a 3 month span and ended up passing out at her lowest weight.  She has been seeing a therapist who has been instrumental in her recovery.  That being said - it seems she is in a holding pattern - physically out of danger and for that I am so thankful and grateful, but emotionally stuck.  Not sure that really makes sense??  She just had a physical and was back up in the 30% for girls her age so that is amazing progress but it's more of what goes through her mind that concerns me.  I realize recovery is not linear and that you can't flip a switch but I guess I was naive in hoping there would be a time when it would be behind us or that I could selfishly put it down.  I try very hard NOT to powerstruggle about food choices but then I find myself thinking ""Really???  You are going to try to have this for snack - like are you kidding me???""  But then I realize well her friends all ate the same thing so that is pretty normal that she would ask for them.
 And I know it's not about a rice cake - it's about control, shame, independence. progress, setbacks and so much more.
In talking with her therapist I know that any judgement or frustration is so counter productive yet sometimes I fall into a mode where I want her to realize how hard I am working - BUT then I think wow if this is hard for me and she doesn't want to hurt me it must be so hard for her.  I am just wondering how other parents continue to support their teens - or how they find ways to separate what is a ""normal"" teen attitude and what is food restriction or active resistance?  I try to support her but I know she perceives my frustration which makes me feel guilty b/c I know that is detrimental to her progress.  Should I take a step back and be patient and thankful or keep nudging her forward.????

24,JustWantMyDBack,04/09/2019,Making the decision to go residential,"Hi everyone,I'm looking for advice on making the decision to enroll my daughter in a residential program for Anorexia.She is 14yr old and was diagnosed in January 2018 (15 months ago).  She did an 11 day hospital stay and we've been managing her illness with the support of an FBT therapist.  Actually multiple:  we originally spent the first 8 months with one via an FBT research study, then we stayed on our own for a while, and now we have a new therapist and a dietician that we really like.We've been able to keep her weight stable and close to her targets, but her anorexic behaviors and willingness to see this as an illness that she wants to fight have not budged.  In some ways, things are worse now than when she first got out of the hospital.  Then, she was eager to do what it took to get her freedoms back, but now she's depressed and has resigned herself to us ""controlling her life"" (her perception) and there's no light at the end of the tunnel for her.On the other side, my wife and I are so incredibly burnt out... plating her food, having lunches with her at school, taking tons of time off work for therapist/dietician/medical appointments, having the predictable arguments and dealing with the tantrums (including the rage-filled moments where she'll get violent and start hitting (anger mgmt issues as well)) is taking a major toll on us and the family as a whole since this process has gone on for so long.  We keep hearing that if she gets to and can stay at some magic weight that eventually she'll start to shift her mindset and we just don't see that happening and are losing hope.  :-(My question for the community is at what point, and how did you come to the decision for your child that home care wasn't going to work, and that you needed to enroll your daughter in a residential program?  And if you did, how did it turn out and would you do it again?I know that we can't talk about particular programs here, but I'd also be interested to know based on your experiences what kinds of questions I should be asking to ensure we get a good fit should we decide to go this route.Thanks in advance,David",_admin_moderator,"Thu,04/18/2019-9:25am","Hello, We would like to let","Hello, We would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove your email address.

25,scaredmom1322,11/19/2018,"The at HOME help that no Doctor, Psychologist, or Psychiatrist can give me","HI! My name is Amy, and I am the mother of a 12 year old girl that is suffering from anorexia. My daughter's struggle begin last spring when she started losing weight because a boy started teasing her about being a FAT COW!!! She begin this journey weighing in the triple digits last spring, to a low double digit as of recent. I took her to the Doctor in May 2018 with concerns and the Pediatrician told me she was in the normal weight range and her BMI was in normal range, and I got told she was an active girl, and was doing just fine!!! That was when things slowly begin to slip. I told the Pediatrician it wasn't the fact that she was in ""normal range"" it was that she had lost a certain number of pounds which is a HUGE weight loss for a child in the 6th grade. He assured me, that there was NOTHING wrong with her, of course in my heart I knew differently.The summer went on, and the weight continued to poor off of her. They told me that I would need to bring her back to the Doctor for a three month check up and lab work and I decided to try taking her to a Family Medicine Professional instead of the Pediatrician.In August 2018 she was down again, and the Family Medicine Doctor thought it was time to have her see a Clinical Psychologist. She begin seeing a Clinical Psychologist August 6, 2018. During the first 6 weeks of the visits with the Clinical Psychologist were spent with my daughter, the Psychologist, my husband, and myself. WE would go to sessions and I would do 95% of the talking and I wasn't sure why she wasn't spending any individual time with our daughter.She started seeing her alone, and some sessions were good, and some were not productive at all.....She felt it was appropriate to move her visits to bi-weekly with her progression. My daughter seems to relate o.k. to the Psychologist but, I am not convinced she is 100% the best fit. I would like her to spend more time with her, and less time visiting with us (mom and dad)Approx, 2 weeks ago she had a re-check up and it didn't go so well this time. She was directly admitted from the Clinic to the hospital for dehydration and low BP. She was back down to her double digit low. Her lab work came back perfect, EKG's came back normal, and she HATED being in the hospital.She stayed two nights, and she was very sad while there. It was very scary for all of us.
She is now seeing a Psychiatrist, Psychologist, and and doing weekly weigh-ins. She says she wants to get better, says she is too skinny, but her behaviors show otherwise. She does the sneaky things at meal time. (Dropping food, throws it away when not looking)
But, desperately says she wants to get better. I am looking for at HOME advice.....
-We are currently doing a meal plan of 6 meals per day.
(Small meals)
-What do other parents do to encourage their child to eat?
-How do you find a fine line between Screaming and yelling to not saying much of anything at all?
-Do any parents use reward systems for their child?
-We are currently using POSITIVE reinforcement every time she does something good, but it just doesn't seem to be enough
-How do parents Cope with the moods and depression
-Have parents tried an anti-depressant and has it been successful for them and their family.
-What tips can you give me to make the home life more comfortable for my family and II know this is a lot of information but I am looking for support. Any information and help is much appreciated.

26,mauricio.malago...,03/23/2019,Orthorexia/anorexia,"Hello everyone and thanks for being on this site. First time I ever joined a forum. Let’s get right to the point. My 12 year old daughter was diagnosed with orthopedic/anorexia nervous while in the ICU. She did 2 weeks in hospital, 2 weeks inpatient, 3 months outpatient. She is finally back at home. I am a father and divorced 50/50% custody.   Meals are difficult as you can imagine and with orthorwxia even more as I don’t necessarily disagree with eating healthy and my daughter has no issue with her weight, actually is happy when she maintains or even gains, to get out of the programs.  Still she is anorexic as she needed hospitalization.  My ex and I are amicable and on the same page usually. My issue is this and all help is appreciated. My ex has issues with all programs my daughter has entered. She has shown disdain for all medical professionals in front of our daughter and feels she is not getting the correct treatment.  This in turns emboldens my daughter to feel she is right in thinking these programs are useless and Shenzhen knows what she is doing.  I have had my issues with her treatment teams throughout but the difference is, I have absorbed much information about the disease and the treatment and understand their plan. My ex wife and daughter feels she needs emotional therapy and that the concentration thus far has only been on her relationship with food.  I’ve explained the whole “anxiety wont kill her/ but an ED will”
Now we were accepted into a research program but now the ex is finds no issues with this as well and in front of my daughter again so she will feel like she can quit with her mother’s blessing.  Her mom now says that the only good treatment are the ones that I simply can’t afford. I do not believe that money is the answer and the more you spend the better therapy you will receive.   How do I get an ex wife to read and understand why solving the disordered eating is the first and most important issue to confront instead of just saying it is not enough.  We are finally going to receive some FBT and learn how to help feed our daughter.  It seems they argue a lot when she is feeding her and she is giving up. My daughter entered the hospital in November 2018 after a very rapid amount of weight loss in less than a certain amount of time.

27,WorriedMom13,02/16/2019,Any help appreciated,"My son is 13. He has been a picky eater since he started eating solid food pretty much. Over time, it has gotten much worse. He will say he is hungry, but nothing sounds good. No matter what I suggest, I usually hear, ""That doesn't sound good."" He will eat only about a dozen things. And food items keep dropping off the list. He used to like a certain food, but won't eat it anymore-no good reason-he says he doesn't like it. He is NOT intentionally anorexic. He WANTS to eat, but can't force himself to if something doesn't 'sound good' to him. Feeding him is my number one worry and stress. He ends up eating alot of fast food because that is what I can get him to eat at times and he doesn't like more than a couple of things I make. He is now starting to say he doesn't like fast food-so the list is dwindling even smaller. He is in a certain percentile in weight for his age/height. He also hates this. He is a very anxious child and exhibits some OCD tendencies.
I have never heard of this type of eating disorder issue before. His doctor doesn't seem to be much help. I have had him to counseling for anxiety and that didn't help at all.

28,caringdaddy0325,07/29/2018,My DD is ill and I feel helpless and hopeless,"Hi
I have a 17 year old daughter that has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and anorexia. For the past couple of years i thought something was wrong but could not figure it out and my dd had not been forthcoming to her therapist.  Last month i found out my dd had been harming herself over a 6 month period, drinking, smoking, sneaking out of the house, lying, manipulating, dieting and exercising ( she is thin ) being promiscuous and she has a 4.0 GPA taking all honors and ap classes and plays to high school sports.
She has been in a PHP day program for about 4 weeks, last week stopped eating over the weekend because she had ex-boyfriend trouble and ended up in the hospital for dehydration.
I am so lost.  I don't know how to handle meal times on the weekends and evenings when she is not at program.  I have her meal plan, list of food and exchanges but she is picky, does not want to eat and I want to make food she will eat and likes.  It's a vicious circle.  She will eat when we go to a restaurant but that's not sustainable.  I don't understand.
She sits on her phone and the couch, barely talks and has told my wife that she has done a lot of ""bad things"" and has shame, but she is not willing to share this.  I believe it will help her get out of shame by getting it off her chest.  I honestly don't care what she's done or has happened.  i believe she can develop better morals, values and charater traits going forward.
She asked the Dr. to discharge her tomorrow.  She has been there for 4 weeks and barely seems like anything is different about her.  It seems like she thinks her way to wellness almost delusional but her behaviour and actions don't really seem like that.
I really don't know where to begin or what to do. Seems like i just want to help her eat and stay alive.  Seems like such a low bar.  Please help me with suggestions, insight and direction.  I am struggling.  I need some reality from a person in this forum that has similar experience or situation.

30,nadanana,01/16/2019,Diarrhea in recovery?,"Hi, I’m currently helping my sister recover at home. She has been on a meal plan since January 1st and has been eating beyond it on most days. The problem is, she has severe diarrhea ever since she started eating- she goes to the bathroom probably around X times a day, if not more. I’ve considered laxative abuse but i don’t think that’s the case. What should I do? Is this normal? Is it advisable to prevent her from earing what she wants, as not to upset her stomach? How do I belp stop it? How do I know when she is in danger? I feel like if we go to a doctor they will put her on a very strict diet like if she hd the stomach flu, and I think that would pull her back into restricting. This is a lot of questions but I hope someone has some advice! Thank you in advance!",_admin_moderator,"Wed,01/16/2019-6:15pm","Hi, nadanana, we're sorry to","Hi, nadanana, we're sorry to hear about the concerns you're having in regards to your sister.

31,Getwell2019,12/14/2018,My 12-year-old daughter is on a journey of recovery,"It will take a lot of baby steps, I truly get it. Especially in the beginning, it will be slow. I tell myself, be patient, beginning is always hard. The breakthrough will come eventually.At least she has opened up herself to me and expressed that she wants to seek professional help. We got a friend and pastor’s wife involved and she is a beautiful and kind fitness instructor. I am taking my girl to do workout sessions with her, and one premise is that she must eat, or “no eating, no workout”. She used to push herself do excessive workouts and skip meals. My friend and fitness instructor told her to do limited workouts and eat a certain amount and has kindly created her a simple menu framework to follow. She is not following it for sure, I am fully aware, as she intentionally hides herself in washroom at breakfast or dinner times. At least she has stopped doing excessive workout now!!! All those baby steps count...I took her out intentionally tonight and our family watched “Green Book” movie. Eating disorder also makes young girls depressed easily. Being pregnant for 7 months and working full-time, I desperately want my girl recover 100% from anorexia, though feeling tired from carrying a heavy belly around. My hubby totally did not get it, and saw eating disorder as a result of my spoiling our daughter. I yelled and screamed at him, “ stop trying to be one if you cannot make it a good doctor; just be a helper on the side if you do not know how to be a good parent, stopping making the problem worse. Enough on my body already!” Later on I showed him a YouTube video on eating disorder story, he started getting it! I also approached our family doctor and we have to wait until early Jan. There is an eating disorder program run by a local hospital, doing family-based treatments for my daughter’s age. And it does need referral from our family doctor. I am constantly tired and still on medications for morning sickness and heartburn. Plan to work until end of Jan to get top-up allowance during maternity leave. We have to consider the financial reality. I wish I could be off work now to focus on helping my daughter with her eating disorder issue. At the same time, I am sometimes unhappy with her, thinking that she is so self-Centered on her body issue and forgets that her not-so-young mother has to go through pregnancy discomfort all the time! Hope my baby will not pop out too early because of the stress!

32,greg9840,11/30/2018,My daughter disagrees about BMI,"Hello everyone,
My 13 year old daughter was recently diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.  She grew over 4 inches fairly recently (she is now 5' 4 1/2"") and simultaneously slimmed down, so my wife and I though she had slimmed down due to rapid growth, so we didn't realize there was a problem with anorexia for several months.  She later admitted she was going days at a time without eating or restricting to only X calories per day at times.  She has been unable to complete her school work due to lack of focus, which has never happened before, so we had her placed on medical school leave.  When we took her to the doctor, he checked her urine and she was dehydrated. I guess we caught this relatively early - her BMI was borderline of healthy weight when at the doctor. We took our daughter to a doctor who specializes in eating disorders, and she said our daughter needs to gain more weight to repair her brain and organs.  My daughter disagrees, saying that a BMI of X is a ""healthy"" weight, so as long as she is at least at X, she is fine.  We have a meeting with a nutritionist next week to discuss BMI in detail, but I was wondering if there is anything we should be telling our daughter in the mean time.  She insists she only has to eat X calories per day with moderate exercise (based on online calorie calculators) to maintain her X BMI.  What is normally recommended for calories at this point, and what are parents supposed to tell recovering children who argue that X BMI is healthy?

33,[email protected],11/19/2018,Thoughts?,"Hello everyone, I have been lurking around here for a month or so and feel blessed to have so much information in one place.  My daughter is currently in an in-patient treatment facility and is recovering.  What I have learned about ED's has left me trying to obtain more information, I feel bad that I didn't know anything about them in the first place.  How could ED's be what they are and I just had no clue?  I actually feel ashamed to some degree.When I started this journey as a parent I was terrified, and to be quite frank I still am.  I started a journal before she was admitted and I have found it to be a good way for me to vent, or to cope with what is happening.  Writing things out seems to help me.  I was thinking about starting a blog, my intent is to bring awareness to the disease and also share my story as a dad.  I couldn't find the specific answers I was looking for in the beginning of this journey.  I couldn't find any on the facility or anything in general about what the first day would be, or what the 21st day would be.  Maybe by sharing my journal I could help another dad like me that felt like he couldn't breathe when this all started.  I spoke to my daughter about this and she says she is ok with it.  I will not be using her name, but she says everyone knows anyway.  She seems to like what I am trying to do, or at least she says she does.  Before the Monster came we were very close, we still are, but I found out some things that had been happening with her ED that makes me wonder if she is being truthful all the time like she use to be.I guess my reason for the post is what do you think?  I feel something pulling me towards doing it but I don't want to be harmful either.   I look forward to your thoughts.

34,jeune,10/27/2018,Only the Stepmom. Step-daughter in her 30s Grievously Ill,"Hi, Friends,
I've only been my step-daughter's step-mom for a few years. She's become VERY ill over the last year.  Her teeth are so gray that when we saw her last week after not being with her for maybe 6 months from a distance I thought she'd gotten braces.Her diagnosis is cirrhosis due to alcoholism but her dear mom, for some reason, will not consider that she also is bulimic.  What can I as a step-mom to do?  I've been 12 Stepping for a lot of years and have seen so many lives miraculously changed that, though I think her mom and sister have lost hope, I refuse to.  There's no money for treatment, however.  I'm doing all I can to gather info for her sister to present to their mom but am VERY concerned that her disease has progressed this far.  I understand that Adult Protective Services can force someone into evaluation. Does anybody have any advice?Thanks so much!",_admin_moderator,"Sun,10/28/2018-2:30pm",Post edited,"Hi Jeune, Welcome to the forums, and thank you for your contribution!

35,Sealfearn,08/01/2018,My 11yr old DD constantly body checking and self loathing,"Our DD was diagnosed with Anorexia in April having very quickly lost a lot of weight and becoming obsessed with exercise.
We were referred to local child mental health support service and thankfully she has restored her weight but what she is now suffering mentally by her still being completely tormented by the anorexic voice in her head that is telling her she is fat and she is obsessed with body checking in any mirror or reflective surface (shop windows, cars etc)
We have talked about this in therapy and hid the mirrors in our house.
We are now on our summer holiday and I think we have made a stupid mistake as we have chosen a poolside and beach holiday which means she is having to wear a swim suit and sienna the first few hours of the day crippling herself and burying herself because she knows she wants to jump in the pool with her sibling but the anorexia and anxiety won’t let her.
I am trying my best to say encouraging and supportive things and sit patiently with her.  Sometimes just holding her until she finds she can do it.
I am wanting to hear from any other parents who can offer words or phrases that have helped their children. It is so sad to see our girl trapped and locked in her head and we are desperate to help her.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,08/01/2018-12:41pm","Hi Sealfearn, welcome to the","Hi Sealfearn, welcome to the NEDA forums.

She is reclusive and refuses to talk about any of her issues. She spends her time shut in her room refusing to let anyone come in. Attempts at engaging in therapy have failed because she says she doesnt wznt to get well nor speak to anyone (except me).
