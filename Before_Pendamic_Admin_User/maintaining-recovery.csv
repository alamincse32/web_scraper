0,Miggi,02/12/2020,Vitamins and Threats,"So today I went to the doctor for a check up. My brother and grandpa accompanied me. It hadn't come up in a while, but I knew it would. My grandpa mentioned my weight, and the doctor whipped out the BMI chart. It was a bit confusing but he basically said, ""You can eat more."" And I was like, Okey. And he suggested multivitamins. But my family is in debate whether he said ""Multivitamins with Iron."" Or ""Something with Iron."" Basically I need Iron. And we went to the store to try to find some, but I got upset because I couldn't find any without gelatin. (I am vegetarian and gelatin is made from animal fat/bones.)
And we found something with ONLY iron, but no other vitamins. My family was like, ""Its just gelatin, and if you can't handle just a little animal if it helps your help we will make you stop being a vegetarian!""
It made me upset that they tried to control what I eat, and the mention of my weight came up again. Its just a little frustrating when your weight/diet is always under a microscope.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,07/12/2021-12:19am",Edited comment,"Hi leonardfluddatw72, we edited your comment slightly to remove an outside link, which is not allowed on the forums – you can review our community guidelines here.

1,meerkat123,12/04/2019,Hair regrowth curly,"I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this.
I have recently gone to treatment, and have been weight restored for around 5 months. Before treatment, my hair was falling out. I probably lost about 1/3 of my hair. But now, since I have been eating properly, my hair is growing back. The weird thing is, it is growing back curly. My hair has been straight my entire life. But since I lost a bunch, it is coming in curly. The hair that did not fall out is still stick straight, its just the regrowth that is curly. At first I thought it was just because it was short. But it is now about 2.5ish inches long and is still quite curly. I am not upset by this, just quite amused. I have no idea why it is doing this, or if it will even stay like this. I was just wondering if anyone has experienced something similar.

4,tryingtobebrave,07/13/2019,Travel stress ,So my grandpa is getting released from the hospital this evening. And my mom told me we’re going out of town tomorrow and coming back Tuesday. I’m overwhelmed and stressed because this was so sudden and have strong urges to exercise again. I’m gonna watch tv to distract myself instead. I just struggle with traveling in general and traveling with my parents during a stressful time is overwhelming. Then my grandpa has to go back to the burn center Friday for more procedures because his burns were so deep on his face. I’m afraid to see him like that. I know it’s a selfish and horrible thing to think. I don’t want to watch him suffer. But I will do anything for him and if it makes him happy to see me I will do it with a smile on my face.

5,nyatama,06/19/2019,Will I ever go back to my pre-ED weight?,"Hi all; I'll try to keep this concise.I used to weigh a pretty normal weight, 18 years old, but i was a little flabby, so I wanted to lose weight.Last January, about 1 1/2 years ago, I developed an eating disorder. Lost my period really damn quickly. I restricted to no more than a low amount of calories a day, and that went on for about five months; I got to my lowest weight this way. After that I was sick of eating so little, so I reverse-dieted to eating around my maintenance calories a day. However, I still gained weight (some of it muscle, but definitely a lot of fat too) and from both higher calories and weeky/monthly binges, I found my way back to my original weight without really even recovering.I'm restored to my original weight, but I still have no period, and I was restricting, exercising, but gaining weight on low calories. Thats called Quasi-recovery, I guess.Anyways, three days ago I finally decided to put my foot down and recover for REAL this time. I've been eating what I want when I want, and I think I've been eating around X calories per day, by my estimation (I stopped counting).However, my question is this: since I started to really recover when I was ALREADY at my original weight, will I ever get back to my pre-ED weight? Or after I have fully recovered, will I always be at my new higher weight? I've never been above my original weight in my life, but now I will be. I've heard about set-point theory and a lot of internet sources say that recovered anorexics ""will eventually go back to their pre-ED weight,"" but I don't know if that applies to me, since I've gained all the weight back but still need to actually recover. I've only read about recovery for people starting real recovery when underweight.If anyone has a story like mine, or knows how my particular case might play out, I'd love to hear. Please.(I want to disclaim that regardless of how much I will weigh at the end of my recovery, I'm going to accept it.  I don't ever want to try weight loss again.  I'm just curious to know if I will stay at my higher weight.)",_admin_moderator,"Thu,06/20/2019-11:28am","Dear nyatama,We would like to","Dear nyatama, we would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove mentions of number of calories, which is not allowed on the forums.

9,Sunnyella,02/08/2020,I need support,"This is my first time writing something like this, so please excuse me if i make any mistake (side not; english is not my native language). Everything started when my classmates (2nd grade, high school) praised me about how skinny i am and how good it is. So i naturally started to think my qualify is being skinny and nothing else. I was around X weight these times and my height was X. I never dieted in my life before until the summer after 2nd grade. I thought i should look skinnier because i will gain weight once school starts again. And my weight dropped. After school started, everything was fine until winter arrived. I saw 46 kg on the scale and couldnt believe my eyes. So i started dieting again and at the same time i was trying to exercise at home. (I couldnt exercise in the gym because my family would never allow me to do, saying you are already skinny enough.) I fasted for a month in summer and i was back to X weight again. But there was a problem. My university exam year was coming and i had to focus my lessons only. I tried to not think about what i eat or how much i eat. (my goal was medical university -thankfully i am in medical university rn- so i had to study so much, and since brain needs glucose to work i had to eat normally) I weighed X on 4th grade. But i was telling myself, once this year is over you will be X weight again. But i could only reach X kg that summer. I went to another city for university. I am staying at the dorm, we dont have a scale here (tbh i wouldnt scale myself even if there was a scale cause im too scared). I came to my hometown for winter break. Scaled myself with lots of anxiety and fear. I weighed X kg which is totally shocking. Because i thought i would gain weight there. I thought i ate more food compared to summer. And now im leaving my hometown again because my break is over. My weight is X kg. I never weighed that much in my life before. I feel bloated. It feels like im carrying fat barrels on my thighs. My thigh gap looks smaller when i look in the mirror. This situation is freaking me out because i didnt even eat too much food. I even lost my period, i have anemia, im freezing all the time so i dont wanna go any further. But at the same time i wanna restrict. Because it looks like the only way for me to loose weight. I hate throwing up and i never throw up i have strong stomach. Im thinking about binging and purging. Im also scared of doctors, dietitians... But you know why? Im hella anxious about showing my body to someone else. I was having such a bad moment atm and burst in tears when i looked in the mirror. But writing these sentences relieved me a little bit. I know this is too long and i feel like people are gonna judge me saying ""you dont even have an eating disorder you are just craving for attention"" but i swear to god this is not the case. I have an unhealthy relationship with food and i wanna fix that so bad. (I tried to talk about my disorder with my family or friends but they are only forcing me to eat more food.

10,Poppymellor,02/05/2020,I don’t know what to eat,"Hi, I’ve been relapsing and recovering from an eating disorder for about a year now. Although I’m a healthy weight and even towards the right hand side of the ideal BMI, I have continued to restrict for the past year to about X calories. Although to everyone else I look like I’ve recovered I have still been religiously monitoring and restricting calories. My body is now used to maintaining its weight at X calories. Now I have taken action and decided to properly recover I am ALWAYS hungry and never satiated no matter how much I eat. However I know if I binge I’ll gain too fast and relapse properly so I am maintaining my daily recommended intake but I am putting on loads of weight from doing so. I feel like I have ruined my metabolism forever. No matter how much I want to recover it seems my body won’t let me. is there any way I can fix my metabolism? I also no longer know what is normal. I don’t know what time people eat or how much or whether they feel full? Should I still be tracking calories? Any advice would be welcomed.

12,msatomicbomb,01/27/2020,My eating disorder is self care?,"I have graduated out of my treatment center for almost a year now and it has been a constant struggle between recover and my eating disorder ever since. My eating disorder can sound so sneaky and logical sometimes. I have intense anxiety all the time and especially with school having started back up, my stomach is in constant knots. In treatment, I have heard that I need to trust my body, listen to what it is trying to tell me. And at the same time, don't listen to it because it is wrong and even when I feel sick to my stomach, I must eat. It is a very hard balance. And The acid reflux just compounds the struggle to eat.
So my eating disorder tells me not to eat because I'm just listening to my body and to eat would be a betrayal against my body. To eat would be a violation. I guess I also have connected my trauma to the act of eating as well. So in my disordered brain, I think I am taking care of myself by not eating. Even though I know to eat is to nurture. To eat is to care for myself, to fight against the trauma. It's all so confusing.
So I guess I'm wondering, does anyone know how to balance these two sides? How to eat despite the fact that my body seems to be screaming ""NO""? Is it about forcing? I feel myself slipping backwards quickly now and it scares me. Eating disorders can be so lonely so if anyone can relate, to hear from you would be appreciated.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,01/27/2020-3:50pm","Dear msatomicbomb, we would","Dear msatomicbomb, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove some language about trauma that could be triggering to other users.

13,rungirlyogi,02/04/2020,Elite Runner No More,"Sharing my story in the hopes someone else out there has gone through a similar journey and can give me some hope.Also lots of these posts I see are from girls in high school or university. I am in my mid-twenties and dealing with this. In some ways I wish this happened to me when I was younger.. I would be living a better life already, at least that's what I think.I'll tell you my story: When I finished uni, I got into running. At first it was just a fun hobby to feel good.. but then I became very very good. I reached an elite level. As a result, I started taking pride in my nutrition. I became an extremely healthy eater.. which then led to me deciding to become a plant-based athlete, and I cut out all animal products, meat, etc. As my times continued to drop, so did my weight. I was getting so many compliments from people noticing how fit and fast I was. Then I got a bone injury.. my first ever. During this time I was even more rigid about my eating.. 8 weeks of pool running later, I was back running and no setbacks. Funny how history can repeat itself.. a year later.. I got my second bone injury (Feb 2019).This time I did not cope well. I spent 3 months relentlessly pool running, waiting for the bone to heal.. and when it finally did, my mental health was not in a good place. I suddenly became so insecure I thought I had put on so much weight ( I didn't but in my mind I thought I did)... started hiding from friends, training partners, etc. as I didn't want anyone to see me.. this is when the binging episodes started. I felt lost and alone in this struggle to put myself back out there, but by isolating myself and ""waiting to lose weight.. I just ended up gaining MORE weight.I didn't want to tell anyone what was going on.. so after 3 months of dealing with binging.. which at the time was very small episodes.. I called my parents and told them everything. Immediately they told me to come home and they'd help me. BIG MISTAKE. I gave up my life and then had to swallow my pride and live with my parents. I became even more depressed and for 2 months with them, I became even more out of control with my eating. Some days I felt suicidal.Finally I got out of their house, moved cities and have since reached out to sports psychiatrist, sport doctor, ED dietician, counsellor etc. 6 months later, the binges are less, but I have had the hardest time getting back to my  passion: running. I have had injury after injury. I think when i was in a state of energy deficiency for so long, my muscles, bones, soft tissue were weakened.Now: I am bigger than I ever have been! I mean I look like a strong athlete, but not like the lean, toned, slim runner I used to be. It's shocking!!! Each day I am trying to be kinder to self, and accept the new person I am. Its incredibly difficult and I wonder if I'll ever get back to my old self, the girl I used to be before the ED took hold of me. I  also must mention my body went through hell. When I first started gaining weight from binging it all went straight to my stomach.. over time it has distributed.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,02/04/2020-4:09pm","Dear rungirlyogi, we would","Dear rungirlyogi, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove language that could be triggering to other users.

I've been trying to self-recover but I don't think I'm getting enough calories. Yesterday I thought I ate enough but I couldn't even sleep last night because I was hungry. I got up at 2am to try to eat something but everything was so unappetizing to me so I was basically forcing food down.

18,kalicomes,01/26/2020,Spouse support,"Hi, I struggle with swings from anorexia to compulsive overeating, or just generally abusing my body with food. For the last five years, I have been eating only fast food and non-nutritional food. At the beginning of January, I decided I wanted to get healthier. I eliminated some types of foods. I did decide to have one day a week that I can maybe eat a dessert or restaurant food, so that I can maintain balance and not start practicing my anorexia again. My husband was on training for three weeks and just got home Friday night. Last night, he said that he wanted to order delivery. I suggested delivery from a healthier option he only wanted X food. I wanted it to be enjoyable and not have to order from two different places, which wouldn’t come at the same time, so I caved and order two very unhealthy options. I immediately felt pain in my stomach and had indigestion. I brought it up to him, explaining that I am not strong enough to say no, and he shouldn’t have brought up ordering out, then also forcing me to order from that place. He said he should be allowed to have X food whenever he wants, and what is the compromise, I said that I was out 5 hours during the day, he could have eaten the X food when I wasn’t home. He said, “but I wanted it for supper”. It turned into a huge argument and he still says that his opinion is he can eat X food whenever he wants. He doesn’t get it and I don’t know what to do. I have an addictive personality and one mistake can turn back into 5 years of abuse to myself. This was his first day back from training and I feel like he could have been more supportive, he disagrees. We are now at a standstill and I don’t know how to resolve it. I am so hurt and disappointed with his reaction. I feel like he is being really selfish and putting a desire for X food above my health. I agree he should be allowed to eat X food whenever, but a) perhaps he could have waited until I was further along in my progress not his first day back b) I think he should eat it, but not suggest ordering it to me. While he was gone, I did a really good job at working on cravings and making good choices. I did express my fear of him returning and me sliding back into unhealthy choices, so I have expressed my needs prior to this happening.

19,thetimetoliveisnow,01/16/2020,Embaressment at home,"Hi all!I'm really struggling with the refeeding process while living at home. My hunger is insatiable; I can never get full, and it's mortifying. I'm so hungry, but I'm so embarrassed by how much I'm eating/want to eat around my family, who all work from home. They know I had anorexia, but I don't think they realize that I'm STILL recovering and that I need more food/nutrition (I didn't realize this until about two weeks ago, myself, when I finally acknowledged how hungry I was and that I was still restricting even though I thought I had finally achieved my ideal body weight. Since, I have let go of that feeling of an ""ideal body weight"" and am just trying to get better so I can live my life). So regarding my embarrassment at home and around my family--what can I do? How can I make them believe me now when in the past I've been so wrong about food? Xoxo, thetimetoliveisnowP.S.

21,RetroactiveGuardian7,01/15/2020,Flare ups,"I was first diagnosed with an eating disorder 20 years ago when I was 12, then I was hospitalized for several months when I was 18 and spent several years in therapy with an eating disorder specialist. I learned a lot and gained a whole toolbox full of coping mechanisms and for over a decade I've been dealing with it on my own. That little voice is always, always there, but I've gotten really good at telling it to shut up. Sometimes though, I still have like these flare ups, like suddenly falling back into it and giving in to the voice telling me ""don't"". But i was always able to get back to a healthy lifestyle again, even though the voice never goes away. But I've always been ob my own so it never affected anyone except me. I've been stuck in one of these flare ups for about a month, but now i have a family and what I'm going through affects way more than just me. I know there's no quick fix or easy solution,  trust me I know this, but if anyone has any advice about how to get myself back on track this time?

22,alisonmarie,01/16/2020,Nutritious food in recovery,"Hi everyone!I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience or if this is uncommon. I've been doing research but haven't found much info. Prior to going into intensive treatment for anorexia after struggling for 10 years, I used to love ""highly nutritious foods"" - usually plain - I loved it. Since coming out of recovery and doing very well, I find I actually get turned off of foods like this. My mom gets so frustrated now every time she makes a nice meal for me that is on the more nutritious side because I legitimately struggle to get it down. Not because I'm afraid of it just because it actually grosses me out! I genuinely would find it easier now to throw back some fast food than a more nutritious cooked meal (which is totally against how my ED voice would have been before).Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this? I'm trying hard because obviously I know I need to have a well rounded diet but lately it has been a struggle!Thanks in advance :)",_admin_moderator,"Fri,01/17/2020-10:06am","Dear alisonmarie, we would","Dear alisonmarie, we would like to inform you that we edited portions of your post to remove language that could be triggering to other users.

I'm really active and enjoy sports and eating healthy but I can't seem to stop the binge and purge cycle.  I have a great job, circle or friends and life at the moment so it seems to be getting in the way.  About a year ago, my periods stopped and I'm now worrying that it will affect my chances to have children.  The doctors said I have a low heart beat and I am sometimes out of breath easily and experiencing heart burn.  I can go weeks with out a binge and purging but then as if out of nowhere (normally when I'm home alone) I do it again and can be doing it every day.  I told my boyfriend but he doesn't really understand and sometimes, my mood swings are crazy and I don't know if this is related. Sometimes, I just wish I had someone to talk to who understands what I'm going through.  Anyway, I just wanted to know if anyone had any tips how to stop the binge?

28,jasmyn,01/04/2020,"""Don't worry about junk food eating in recovery""... for how long? When does it stop?","My disordered eating started age 7, full blown anorexia at age 15, and i started recovering age 19-20. I'm now 26.
For me, I kind of recovered backwards... my psychological recovery happened first and I rarely if ever struggle with it anymore. However my physical and behavioral recovery I am struggling with.
Ive searched the internet and the only things I can find regarding sugar in recovery are people saying not to worry about it or encouraging it. Saying to eat whatever you crave. And that's what I started off doing but it's been years now and it only seems to be getting worse.
My intuitive eating tells me to eat any hour of the day and it ends up being all over the place. And it tells me to eat pretty much pure sugar.  And because of that I never have the chance to think about fruits and vegetables. It makes my body feel so unhealthy and my family is getting concerned but I've been telling them ""no, in recovery you have to eat whatever and whenever your body wants you to because you need to take advantage of that appetite and learn to follow your cravings!"" But it's been years now and they're starting to say that's wrong. I'm starting to doubt it too but now I'm so addicted to sugar.Also, I thought eating sugar and junk food would help me put on weight fast?? But Im still very severely underweight! I don't understand. My dad is a fitness instructor and he says I need to eat healthy food to gain weight but this goes against everything I've ever known... don't people always call sugary stuff ""fattening""? And they eat healthy to lose weight? So I don't understand?I'm really tired of eating so unhealthy and it's honestly sapping my energy and ruining my teeth by now.

29,iwanttolive,01/02/2020,meeting with my therapist today,"So as some of you know, I have been having some trials with my therapist.  Today went very well.  She said the term ""feeling sorry for myself"" was and is not a judgement.  She said she was feeling sorry for herself because she hurt her back last night.  We reworded it to make it more palatable to me.  That things were very difficult.  I have this picture of my one sister who was incredibly able to attend Christmas dinner even thought she can't eat, and when pictures were taken my one sister/friend and my sister were standing very close, my sister leaning into my friend with me standing alone.  Tonight I went out to eat with my sister visiting from North Carolina and her son along with my parents.  As we got seated, two of us, my sister and myself, were sitting next to each other on one bench, and her son on another between us and my parents.  But then she moved and left me sitting alone on the bench and it really hurt.   I frequently get dismissed in conversation and mid sentence.  I showed my therapist the picture taken of us at Christmas and she clearly sees the rejection and alienation from my sisters.  My parents are unable to see it.  Even tonight.  I like to clear the table and move the plates to the edges of the table to make it easier for the server.  My father hates this but I said I want to do it.  He allowed me to for the first time.  But my sister who was farthest from the end of the table refused to allow me to put her dishes with the rest at the end of the table.  Such ridiculous things but hurtful and sends me the message of ""I matter, you don't"" to me and that I am not important and stupid.  She has always been superior and taken away my baby sitting jobs and got close to the people I was close to including her current husband.  We were friends and were trying to start up a group at church for those in their 20""s and 30'.  She somehow caught wind of it and before you know it she left school in North Carolina and they were married not too long after.My Mom's friend really understands me and believes me about the pain I experience with this rejection.As for my therapist, she believes I do suffer from a serious level of PTSD and not so much Borderline.  I know I don't have Borderline, but know my symptoms correlate with PTSD.  She agreed but does not feel this is the time to work in force with the PTSD until I am more stable and we know how my sister will do.  She is not doing well.  Had a fever of 104.5 today and she never gets fevers because of her dysautonomia.  She has a blood infection and the port where she is fed is infected and needs to come out.  TPN feeding, done through a port, is dangerous and life threatening and not meant for long term use as it can cause death.  The doctor believes she isn't tolerating the TPN and will give her  nutrition through a vein but she has none so we don't know how this is going to work.  Then they will put her port on the other side of her neck once the infection is cleared.My therapist still does not want me going to my house until we figure out what is happening with my sister.  She is still very aggressive with me as sick as she is.  But I am not listened to and ignored and unimportant.  There comes the overeating and thoughts of self harm because I just don't know how to deal with all of this.My therapist if finally going to try to work on seeing me twice a week.  I tried the support group she recommended and pulled out some DBT skills so she knows I am trying and listening to herp advice.  I have been with her for about two and a half years and really don't want to start new with someone who doesn't know me at all or my parents.  I will start going to a support group that is Christ centered.  This coming Monday.  It meets weekly so that is positive.There is so much going on it is difficult to keep this short.  I apologize.  I am going to bed early tonight.  I am so tired and worked four days this week.  I usually work three.  Four is a lot plus going to the hospital and visiting with my sister and all that.  I wish you all well.  You are all terrific even as we battle life's complications.  We support each other and do our best.  And when we can't do our best, we wait until we can again and then start from there.

I also don't know what I should do to fight the urges, but they've been very strong and have also affected my eating.

32,bunnyteaparty,12/23/2019,Struggling,"It’s becoming increasingly difficult for me to maintain recovery. I had graduated from a recovery center in September, and for a little while I was doing pretty well. But now my intrusive thoughts are getting a lot worse. I can’t stop thinking about how I look and what I’m eating. I feel like the ugliest person in the world, I’m terrified to leave my house because people will see me and judge me. I obsessively look in the mirror and take pictures of myself hoping one of them will look good enough. Dressing up has always been one of my biggest passions, but now I’m scared to wear certain things because I get scared people will judge me and my body for how I look in them. I’m still eating regularly for the most part, but I’m going back to disordered habits. The negative thoughts and emotions are so overwhelming. I was determined to recover before, I’ve always wanted to be an activist for eating disorder awareness and body positivity and I wanted to recover so I can achieve my career goals, but I also want people to love me and think that I’m attractive. Now, I don’t know if I want to recover, and it’s hard to tell if it’s the right thing when everywhere I look I see new diets and people praising others for being conventionally attractive while putting others down for not looking a certain way. I think one thing that caused things to go wrong was that after graduating I was supposed to have a therapist and a dietitian to see regularly. I do have a therapist I see every 2 weeks, but I never got a dietitian since my family and I got distracted by other things. I want to bring it up, but my parents always say how expensive I am already, so I feel too guilty. It’s also hard not having a support system like I did at the center, where I could talk to other people struggling with eating disorders and people trained specifically for eating disorders. I’m starting college in a couple weeks and I’m terrified I’ll fail because my mind is so preoccupied with food and how I look, and that other people will judge me for how I look.

I was grinding my teeth in my sleep last night and partially bit one of my brackets from my braces off. I called and go in next Tuesday to have it fixed as I already had an appointment that day anyway.
This tiny thing that didn’t turn into a big problem caused me to spiral. Like I feel like I’m not equipped to handle life when I get so stressed and overwhelmed that I shut down over something so small. I feel defective.
I have to be careful about what I eat until the bracket is fixed, yet that’s still not enough to deter me from planning a binge when my mom goes out later and I’ll be home alone. I want to binge so badly I can’t stand it. What is wrong with me???? Why am I like this??? You hear all these things about how going through traumatic things and having a traumatic childhood makes you strong and resilient but it doesn’t feel that way for me at all, it feels like the opposite.

First of all I am not binging but overeating.  I eat in my room in her house.  She is telling me I am not to have food in my  room anymore.  I am trying to see my therapist twice a week but she is so busy she doesn't have and hasn't had any openings.  My mom asked me if I had anyone I could talk with outside of therapy and I said no.  She said no one?  It makes me sad to feel so alone.  To want a hug not a lecture from my parents.  I know they love me.  I just want it expressed in different ways.  Hugs.   A back rub if I ask for one.  To have them listen to a five minute testimony I did at church a few weeks ago but after I asked three times and the timing was never right, I stopped asking.  It won't ever be listened to.My dad can spend five hours with someone form church helping them get ready for court where he will be with them tomorrow.  But to have him help me finish the complaint from when I was in the hospital, it is asking too much and they don't have the time.AND I really offended someone from church and she sent a rather scathing text some places in bold saying to NEVER drop by their home, EVER and to respect her BOUNDARIES.  I dropped off two pictures I colored since they weren't in church Sunday, parking my car several houses down and left the pictures on their porch, and left without knocking or calling.

41,amayasky,12/09/2019,Feeling triggered after years in recovery,"Hi everyone,
I'm reaching out because I had a bad experience recently which has triggered unhealthy thoughts and I'm a bit lost as to what to do, especially as I considered myself pretty much fully recovered and am quite shaken by how much this has gotten to me.
Brief background: I had anorexia from the age of 11 and was particularly bad and hospitalised ages 15-17. I'm 22 now and have been doing really well for about 3 years, so much so that I wouldn't consider myself to have an ED anymore and rarely think about it.
It sounds really stupid what's triggered this but here goes. Essentially, I'm going to a festival next year and bought some new clothes for it, lots of which are quite skimpy, cropped tops etc. I tried them on last night and, although I wasn't in a particularly bad place in my head, suddenly got really paranoid that I looked stupid. It's incredibly frustrating because first of all I'm always preaching to my friends about body positivity - I think people should wear whatever they're comfortable in and rock it their own way. Sadly, though, I don't apply the same standards to myself. Secondly, I know, factually, I have a healthy BMI and have been fairly comfortable with my weight for a while now. I do however, obviously, weigh more than I did when I was really ill, and although I *know* that's a good thing, my thoughts are conveying that it’s unattractive.
I haven't had thoughts like this, at least not this compulsively and self-critically, for a long time and I feel awful. After I took the clothes off I cried and cried then felt the need to revert to my ED behaviors. For example, I skipped dinner, which I told myself was because I felt sick but I kind of know I didn't want to eat because I'd feel guilty about it.
I know everybody gets self-conscious but I'm worried because of how much it's hurting me and the thoughts I'm having around it. It's really taken me by surprise as I've had a relatively healthy relationship with my weight, food and exercise for a few years now and it's so out of the blue and really intense really suddenly.
I don't know what to do or who to turn to - I don't see a therapist or any mental health professionals anymore and I don't want to mention it to my friends in case they worry I'm getting ill again. I feel like it might just be a blip and maybe in a couple of days I'll get over it/feel better about it, but considering my experience and how rapidly I know things can spiral out of control I don't know what I can do to keep myself healthy and on track. I might be overreacting, I don't know, it's just really painful to be having these thoughts and compulsions again when I thought I was doing so good.
Sorry for such a long post and thanks a million if you read it all, any advice or supportive words would be appreciated, I just needed to vent about it somewhere I felt I wouldn't be judged",_admin_moderator,"Mon,12/09/2019-8:21pm",Edited your post!,Hi amayasky - welcome to the forums!

I know I mentioned in another thread that I was having issues with my cycle. Well it was because I didn’t ovulate, so when I did get my period it was drug out and heavy. I started feeling really weak and dizzy. I worked out two days during and it did me in. I honestly thought it would be ok- sometimes it is still hard for to take a rest day, but thankfully I have my husband to tell me what is rational. He made me realize that my body was going through so much, and I didn’t need to add the extra stress of a workout on top of it. My body feels much better for it.

Back to the story, I have actually been trying to gain weight so I kept this in mind when we went out to eat. I ordered some food. The sandwich was large, but it wasn't gargantuan. I ate the whole thing and when I finished she said, ""Wow, I didn't expect you to eat that whole thing. I thought you would take half of it home.""
I replied, ""Was it really that big?"" I felt very self-conscious at this point.
And then she said, ""Kinda, I mean it was A LOT of food.""
I said, ""Well... I don't know, it was a large meal...""
And right after that I feel like restricting. Why would she say that when she knows? I feel like a fat mess. I want to skip meals but I know the responsible thing to do is to not skip...

49,ceerecovery,11/25/2019,Feeling painfully full on meal plan,"so I have just begun recovery (diagnosed by a specialist literally 4 days ago) and my parents have jumped right in with a full meal plan, they choose everything and i have to finish everything. however recently after a big lunch i feel ok, but then the snack is usually just as big and halfway through I feel full. then uncomfortably, then painfully full and although my body (or maybe the ED) is feeling sick and sore and bloated my parents say i have to suck it up (in a nicer way) and get through it. it sucks because i end up hating the food i just had that made me feel so sick. i struggle after the meals seeing myself so bloated and knowing it's going to happen all over again, and begin to dread the next meal knowing even if i feel full or sick i won't be able to take a break. i hate myself after this and sometimes it ruins a meal i was proud of eating-and turns into disgust and fear and panic.is this normal? is it all in my head? thats what my parents keep telling me and serving the same or larger meals each time and shut me down mostly when i talk to them about what i feel like or eating or when i feel uncomfortable and sick. i feel bad for being 'picky' and yet terrified the only way to get through this ED is to eat until i feel sick and unhappy with myself, over and over-so every meal feels like a binge and yet one i can't avoid because it is being chosen for me.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,11/25/2019-8:13pm",Edited Your Post!,"Hi CeeRecovery - welcome to the forums.

50,tryingtobebrave,11/29/2019,Shame ,"Lately I have been feeling a lot of shame about eating and having as much on my meal plan as I do, because I’m in bed a lot and don’t have a lot of movement. Rationally my dietitian said I need this much to just survive, and I understand that, but emotionally it causes a lot of shame. I think I have been tying shame to food to avoid dealing with the underlying issues.
The tension between my parents right now is really affecting me. Having to comfort my mom as she sobbed the morning after my dad was hateful to her while she sat at his bedside in the ER, brought back a lot of bad memories. I got hurt standing up for her when I was young, still comforted her after, then was shamed by both of them for it. What a mind game. I’m really concerned my mom has a dissociative issue due to drastic changes in her personality, crying and scared to childlike and playful, to narcissistic almost. But she will never get counseling and it’s just sad to see. Luckily I personally have a dissociative disorder as well so it doesn’t freak me out, I’m just concerned. I know she’s endured a lot of trauma starting from when she was a small child to an adult and never has dealt with any of it.Today my depression was so heavy I felt like life was pointless and for the first time in a while, it was so difficult to eat. I didn’t meet my meal plan. I just didn’t care about anything, I especially don’t care about myself because I feel worthless so I think, why bother? I’m worth nothing to anyone. And I’ve been a horrible person because I ignore the people reaching out to me. I don’t know why I do this. Isolating is one thing but I never completely ignore everyone like this. Yet I can’t stop myself and it just makes me hate myself more because I’m a bad friend.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,12/01/2019-11:49pm",Resources,"Hi tryingtobebrave.

55,chrysanthemym,11/18/2019,"Is recovery from an eating disorder supposed to feel this ""bad""?","Hey everyone!I've been dealing with anorexia on and off for most of my adult life (I'm 23 years old). My first relapse was when I was around 19 years old. I quickly lost a lot over the course of four months. It wasn't until around Christmastime that year that I ended up paying for it and landed in the hospital after having a big holiday meal which triggered a Pancreatitis episode due to a severe amount of gallstones in my gallbladder thanks to my relapse. After having emergency surgery to remove my gallbladder, I healed over the course of a month and returned back to eating and gained everything back.Fast forward to now, I’ve once again been quickly losing weight over the course of several months, and I've finally hit rock bottom. I've lost my period, I'm cold all the time, and I'm absolutely done. After reaching this breaking point with my anorexia, I decided to finally choose recovery (currently self recovering at home while working with a therapist).That was three days ago.And now I’m just feeling really confused, lost, and a bit reluctant and would really love to hear from other people who recovered from eating disorders on what their experience was like when they first started, because for me? It’s been weird.The first day I decided to eat, I was ravenously hungry all day and I decided to follow through and honor it. Then, later that night, I woke up feeling severely dehydrated (my eyes and lips were literally dry as the sahara and I was so thirsty). On top of feeling really dehydrated, I had a really rapid heart rate and felt like I was going to pass out. I had to go pee and so I did and my urine was really really cloudy. Eventually, after drinking enough water and a sports electrolyte drink and taking a potassium and magnesium supplement with some food, I felt better and went to sleep.The second day, I woke up with absolutely no appetite. None whatsoever. Nada. Siltch. I was feeling really bloated and really full from the day before that I had no appetite at all. Despite having no appetite, I forced myself to eat and snack all day because despite feeling full, I was thinking about food constantly but know that my body is probably just really damaged from these past eight months of disordered eating. Throughout the second day, I felt so inexplicably tired, bloated, mentally foggy and drained. I had no mental energy, I couldn't think straight, and honestly just wanted to do absolutely nothing all day. I felt depressed and anxious.The third day (today), I feel exactly the same as the second day. I had absolutely no appetite, my body is now sore in weird places (like my back and my arms)?, my stomach is still bloated, I'm not hungry at all, my brain feels super foggy and tired and I feel absolutely useless. I've done legitimately nothing these past few days and I don't have the mental energy to do anything but lay around, eat, and sleep. I've eaten past fullness nearly every day (despite not feeling hungry or even craving anything) thinking it'd give me more energy, but now I just feel even more tired and more mentally foggy and just exhausted all the time.I don't have an appetite at all and feel extremely bloated and tired. I have headaches frequently and sometimes my heart beats faster than usual. I feel really sluggish and mentally foggy and overall depressed. Honestly, I have to force myself to eat sometimes because I legitimately have no appetite.Is this normal and will this get better? It's just a little disheartening when I finally want to get better and eat and my body's just fighting back.When will things go back to normal and I'll get my personality, my energy, and my life back?Does anyone have any advice from their eating disorder recovery?

57,seeyaed,11/15/2019,SEVERE pain and fatigue during recovery,"Hi Everyone,I am 55 y.o. and I have a 45+ year history of anorexia and over-exercise. I started my recovery approximately 3 1/2 months ago. I have stopped exercising completely and have been following my meal plan as best as I can. (There are days that I don't meet the requirements of my meal plan). When I embarked on my recovery, I continued to exercise but, scaled it WAY back. After a month or so, I had to be honest with myself and admit that I had increased the amount of time I was exercising and had doubled and tripled the amount of weight I was lifting. I took the leap and stopped completely. At the beginning of recovery, I dealt with severe insomnia (averaging 2-3 hours/night). After I stopped exercising, this severe fatigue and all over body pain set in with muscle cramping and extreme headaches. I also have poor memory, brain fog, tingling in my extremities and dizziness. It continues to get worse to the point that just going to the grocery store leaves me in so much pain with so much fatigue, I can barely move. I am feeling depressed and so ashamed of what I have done to my body. I wondered if any of you have dealt with this extreme pain and debilitating fatigue?

Both waived the fees because they are aware of my change in insurance and my decision to stop medicine and therapy because of cost. However I have been suicidal lately. My psychiatrist gave me samples of my medicine. They were both very nice to help me when I’ve been feeling so badly.

I now need to do a glucose monitor test in the next few weeks. This seems odd as i even went for a run before this blood test so bit worries about my high result. And now its getting in my head in terms of recovery, like limiting certain food types (not that i eat much of that anyway). My BMI is ok, but i still restrict and alot of the time my meals are hit and miss, and i seem to eat most of my cals late in the evening. Just wondering if anyone can relate to these results (high blood glucose) is it just my pancreas thats out of sync and needs retuning, or is it my random meals times that are making it worse?

69,tryingtobebrave,11/01/2019,Old feelings ,"Today has been pretty much the same with the depression. As pathetic as it sounds, I’m starting to adapt to the hopeless, apathetic feelings and little motivation. Just have to get through the next few months focusing on one day at a time, one hour a time, one minute at a time. Same as every year. (Which is also kinda bleak).
This whole week has been a mess with people renovating the other bathroom in our house. Most of it’s done, but my dad has lost his temper a lot because he’s so manic. I really hate being around him when he’s like this because it’s so triggering, even if not aimed at me. The issues I talked to my therapist about, with my mom becoming narcissistic and emotionally abusive at times, when he treats her like that it’s really obvious why because she just pretends like it didn’t happen. But it’s affecting her and her behavior and I feel so alone because i was fine with having minimal emotional ties to him, because I at least had my mom. Both of us with our own issues but I know she loves me. And maybe it’s unfair, but I resent him for her becoming someone who’s colder and narcissistic (especially when he’s around). He took the one close family tie from me. And at dinner tonight, somehow the topic of my high school principal came up, and he was ranting about how he dislikes the guy and something in me snapped. I never show him how the trauma he caused affects me because he apologized in the past. But I couldn’t take it tonight. I told him he sure didn’t act like he disliked him when in a conference about my depression, they shamed me together in front of all my teachers and counselor and I was humiliated and felt worthless. They all pitied me after that. I remember that conference so clearly, two grown men saying cruel things about my mental illness in a room full of people. It brought up feelings of worthlessness at dinner, then shame for eating at that moment, and then my dad guilted me for voicing my feelings by saying “you know I die a thousands deaths every day” like he’s the victim and I’m the monster for voicing my pain.
Nothing has changed, I still feel alone and hopeless but now my stupid ptsd is amped up on top of it. I can’t wait for him to go back to work next week. I rarely see him Monday through Friday even though we share a house, and my mom is a kinder person when he’s not around.
I just needed to vent this.

72,tryingtobebrave,10/29/2019,Alone,"I know this is probably a cognitive distortion from my depression, but I feel like the few people I’m really close to in my life don’t actually want anything to do with me, like I’m an annoyance to them and they’re just being nice. I also feel a lot of discord with my mom, and that’s not actually a cognitive distortion, our relationship is really complicated. She can be emotionally abusing, not intentionally and I know she’s had so much trauma in her life that she’s never dealt with and refuses to acknowledge. I have a much older friend whose son was suicidal and went inpatient, and she is so traumatized from it but getting help. In my case, my mom saved my life. I know it messed her up and though I attempted to make amends I know it still affects her so much because she never dealt with it and so I allow her to treat me poorly because I feel like I’m to blame.
But my depression is so bad now, that her rejections really hurt. She asked me why I was going to bed so early, and I told her a migraine from my jaw issue and she pushed me away and sighed in annoyance like she tends to do half the time, though the other half she does act like she cares. She doesn’t understand my depression either. She complains about the things she “has to do” every day, that I don’t contribute enough, but those things are her OCD behaviors to cope and I’m not enabling that. But she puts me down, is so negative but putting the blame on everyone else. Which it kinda is my fault so I take it.
But feeling like the other few people I’m close to hate me, is a cognitive distortion I know. But it makes me feel so alone and hopeless and makes the apathy worse. I don’t have thoughts of hurting myself, but I’m so low and struggling to take care of myself that I’m scared my psychiatrist is gonna admit me to the acute psych ward when I see her next month.

73,fightingbee,10/29/2019,confused about eating disorder,"Hi
So lately I've been really confused about my eating disorder. Do I even have one?
What would you consider an eating disorder?
I feel like, because I eat what is considered a normal amount, and I don't leave out certain food groups, don't have ""fear foods"" etc, I don't have a real eating disorder, let alone anorexia. I am currently underweight and hate that I'm gaining weight but I feel like that is the only thing keeping me in the disorder. It's like I ""want"" the disorder and actively choose not to eat certain things (because it's ""too easy"" for me to eat them, someone who is really sick couldn't do that) or to restrict my intake instead of the other way around (wanting to get better but not being strong enough to) and now I'm really confused... is that really me wanting a disorder and choosing it everyday... or is that really my disorder trying to deceive me into believing it's me who has these thoughts???
ugh i'm so confused and I don't know if anyone understands what I'm trying to say... I hope someone does.

74,kathleen.obrien...,10/28/2019,Suddenly Struggling Once Again,"So here's some background information:I've struggled with an ED ever since I suffered a severe concussion in 2014 when I was 15 years old.  Ever since then, I've been in and out of treatment countless times.  I have never had a period longer than a year of stable and full recovery without returning to treatment.  all of high school I was in and out of treatment, but still graduated somehow and got into college.  In 2017, my freshman year of college in San Diego (I live in New York) I had to go on medical leave because I relapsed.  I came back to college Spring 2018 and did well, but was still using behaviors occasionally.  Coming home to NY in the summer 2018 was great until I relapsed really badly but then came out of it fairly quickly and had a great rest of the summer.  Went back to San Diego for the first semester of my sophomore year, and I relapsed about 4 weeks into the semester.  Things got worse, and I considered going to an IOP program but didn't end up following through because I was so busy with school.  By the time I get home, I was stable but struggling a lot.  That winter things started going downhill.  I wanted to go back to SD for Spring 2019 semester, but I knew I needed support, so I planned on doing IOP out in SD.  Come the spring semester, I'm falling hard and don't even qualify for IOP.  They would only put me in PHP or residential.  I refused because I needed to keep up with my academics, so went without treatment for 1-2 months until I ended up in the hospital and had to leave school and went to residential treatment back home (this is in April 2019).  I got out of residential, come home, and the summer ended up being great at first, and then I got increasingly depressed and suicidal.  Against the advice of my doctor and therapist, I came back out to San Diego for the start of my Junior year (now currently- this fall semester 2019).  Surprisingly, I have been doing so well since I've been here. Little to no behavior use, my thoughts and urges to use behaviors and self-harm significantly decreased.  I was happy and thriving, and doing great socially and academically. My problem right now:Out of no where and suddenly I feel a tremendous amount of anxiety, depression, and desire to start losing weight again.  My thoughts have been getting significantly worse over the past 4 days.  And I used a specific behavior for the first time since August and I was so proud of myself for not using it or even having urges to.  And now, everything feels like it is collapsing around me.  All within one week.  I don't know why this is happening so fast, especially because I was doing the best I had been doing in my life.  My symptoms haven't been active for long (only 1 week) but from knowing all my past experiences, relapses happen fast and they are ugly and it seems like there is little to nothing I can do from stopping them.  I'm extremely distraught because I thought this was finally going to be the one semester I could actually enjoy and get through without actively using my eating disorder.  I feel hopeless.  At this point in my life, I feel as if relapse is always inevitable and I'm just going to have to go back to treatment eventually, get better, have a sustained period of stability, then fall again, return to treatment, stop using behaviors, live life and be stable, then relapse. Over and Over and Over again.  This has been my life.Anyways, I'm just looking for support because I don't know what I should do in this moment.  I haven't been in a hole for long BUT my gut tells me, and I have this weird feeling that everything once again is going to come crashing down around me.

75,ellyyang0315,10/29/2019,Batting overweight after recovery,"I battled bulimia for about two years, and I've been on the road to recovery since 2013. I no longer purge or self-harm in any form, and I'm slightly less likely to obsess over body image. My main concern is that my relationship with food is still not very healthy, and about three years into my recovery I began feeling almost invincible. I think part of me felt like I conquered bulimia and I'm invincible, and now I can eat ""bad foods"" however much I want without wanting to purge! I was under a lot of school/professional pressure around that time, and I ate a lot and wasn't very active. This has led to me putting on a ton of weight (don't want to mention numbers because I know that numbers can be triggers), and my body fat percentage is now in the medical range of ""obese."" I've had trouble getting back to a normal BF% for about three years now, and recently I'm really starting to loathe myself. I doubt I'll go back to purging, but I hate that I still loathe myself and that my ED hasn't truly gone away (because I still have a bad relationship with food). To make things worse, I'm a western girl born and raised in a part of Asia where most people are thin anyway.

80,weouthere,10/06/2019,Struggling with relapse,"It's been a while since I've posted on here, but I'm back. I've been in recovery since February and I saw a therapist through my university for free for most of the Spring semester. Unfortunately, the school doesn't have the money to provide counseling longer than 1 semester per person so I would have to pay for a therapist myself if I try again. The thing is I didn't think I was even going to need this otherwise I would have sorted it out in the summer, but now with classes and work going on I don't have time to drive out to see a therapist in the middle of the week. I was doing really well at the end of last semester, I wasn't having any ED thoughts and I thought I would be fine this semester without any help. I started working out this summer because I work at a gym at the front desk so the membership is free and I needed something to keep me busy and out of summer depression. It started off innocent and wanting to have some muscle on my body since I lost it all from my ED. It got more unhealthy and I was going X times a week, I got some muscle definition but now that I'm in classes and can only go X times a week. I've gone back to restricting and skipping meals all the time. I know this doesn't help grow muscles which is frustrating but I am so stressed with school that I don't have time to plan out meals or grocery shop or cook for myself or think about recovery right now. I wish someone would notice and say something but my best friend is too occupied with her ""boy troubles"" to notice that I'm falling apart.

81,tryingtobebrave,10/21/2019,Defeated ,"I’m doing fairly well in recovery but I’m losing the will to keep fighting for it. Tomorrow I get my braces adjusted and will use liquid meals for the day, that my dietician gave me recipes for so I get enough nutrition but then Wednesday I have the opportunity to lie and use behaviors all day. For some reason, have liquid meals even though I physically need them half the time because not being able to chew much has messed up my digestion, makes the ED part of my brain go nuts. I want the comfort of behaviors so badly.
I’m tired of being in pain and fighting for recovery and trying to be positive. I don’t feel positive. I feel exhausted from all of it and it feels like recovery is too much work and not worth it anymore. The woman who adjusts my braces and my orthodontist always ask how I’m doing and try to help, but I feel like if I’m honest about how much pain I’m in, I will start crying because I feel like this has defeated me. I can’t take it much longer and yet I have months to go.
Fairly stressed about people being in the house to rmodel one of the bathrooms for the next couple days. My dad is home from work while it’s happening and the stress has caused him to start arguing with my mom and he yells so loudly sometimes at her that I hear it from across the house, it’s so triggering.

I thought that once I started eating again I wouldn't think about my next meal all the time, but I still do. Everyday, all day, I think about what my next meal will be, when it will be, and how much it will be. It keeps me up at night, and if I go out to eat I rarely focus on the person i'm with but rather on what i'll order. And if I decide to treat myself to a dessert i'll think about how I didn't need it, and feel the urge to restrict. But I can't, because if anyone saw me skip a meal, they'd be upset with me.

92,alwaysthinking,09/22/2019,That old anxiety,"I've been trying to fight it the past 2 days and today has just been awful. Every time I go to eat, that old anxiety just resurfaces and makes me absolutely petrified. I've been able to power through it and eat anyway but I am so frustrated that this feeling has returned so quickly. I'm not really sure why it has returned so quickly. Maybe it's because I don't have proper follow-up care. It's not like I didn't try to get that follow-up care. It's just not available in my area. I'm doing my own PHP again and I'm doing everything I can to prevent relapse and I'm just dealing with a lot of physical exhaustion which could have a lot to do with it as well. I'm not really sure why I'm having this physical exhaustion and if it continues, when I have my wellness check with my physician in a week I'm going to let him know and see what he says about it. Because it's really getting exasperating. I'm still determined and still very motivated not to let my eating disorder ruin my life anymore. I'm also very determined not to let any of my other disorders through in my life anymore. There are just some days and moments when they seem to have the upper hand. Today seems to be one of those days. I know logically that I need to be eating and I need to be eating a certain amount in order to be healthy and in order to do my Ministry. I want to be healthy. I want to be able to do my Ministry. And if I'm being completely honest, there is still a part of me that is hanging on to the other disorders and yes, the eating disorder because then if I am not healthy, if I get sick, it means I have someone to take care of me when I go into the hospital. Something I never had growing up. I've always been the caretaker. Granted, it's not the way I truly want it to be because it's not the real relationship I want to have with people. But in my distorted mind, my brain is saying I have no idea what it's like to have someone take care of me so I might as well keep getting sick to have some idea of what it's like to have somebody take care of me. I know I don't really want this. I enjoy taking care of other people. I enjoy being there for others. I feel so messed up right now. I'm tired of feeling defective.

I am weight recovered for now about 1.5 years,but only weight restored.
I am thinking everyday about my weight and what i'll eat or not eat. Everytime i'm eating something, i'm guilty.
I am overweight since then, i have about X pounds to be where i feel the best and i am trying to loose weight healthily, with doing exercise and eating healthy and sometimes of course indulging some treats. But it leads to nothing. I am exercising and eating healthy since june of 2018 and nothing is changing, i'm still overweight and even gaining weight (that isnt muscles!). yes during summer i stopped my routine and indulged more treats but like any other girls my age, but i'm always the one to gain weight. and i feel it in my clothes and everything.
i'm afraid cause i feel that i will never be a normal young woman, that i will always have to be careful with what i eat, that i will always be the chubby one. I'm afraid cause the only answer i see in my head is going back to my dirty old habits. but in one hand i know its not the answer .

Caffeine strongly influences my mood for the better, but I worry about dependency so I try to only have it every few days. So not only is my mood dropping now because of food, but without caffeine tomorrow I likely won't have nearly as much of a chance at a good mood.

Instead of thinking about how hard is gonna be the next two weeks or the next month I will just think about one day at a time. At least tricks my mind to think is easier. No recovery is easy I know. But if I want to keep going I need to give myself a little help, because In the end I only have myslef. :)",_admin_moderator,"Wed,09/11/2019-8:56pm",Welcome! ,"Hi! Thank you for posting.

99,kmcsherry,09/08/2019,I feel like my ED will be a never-ending struggle and I don't know if I can take it ,"One of the hardest things for me is imagining what people would think of me having an ED. I feel like i look average in weight, and i'm not saying this because I have an ED. I look at girls all the time and they are so much skinnier than me. And then I think to myself, if i was to stand next to a bunch of thin girls, I would be the last guess for ""who's anorexic?."" I feel like some of my friends don't even think my ED is that serious, like i don't have MAJOR mental issues. At school I do my best not to show it and out in public. But at home, it's a whole different story. I scream at my parents and siblings, cursing, crying, and screaming. I just feel like this will be a never ending struggle. I feel like I'll never feel confident and I'll always resent myself. I'm so exhausted. It's been 2 years, and I've ben on a meal plan for a year and a half of it with an Eating Disorder program.I feel like I have no control and my life is not my life. I just can't imagine how I can keep doing this, and waking up everyday to a battle. Is anyone else feeling this way, and or they felt this way in the past. I never really thought about blogging about my feelings, but I need help.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,09/11/2019-6:01pm",Resources ,"Hello.

I really want to avoid this as it would be detrimental to my grades. I haven’t exactly been eating more but I have stopped going for my run once a day. I doubt that run was even substantial but I still feel disgusted and angry with myself for putting a halt to this part of my exercise routine. I’m still doing high-intensity workouts X times a day but I still feel extreme guilt. How can I deal with this feeling? Should I go back to running? I feel lost and scared.

106,Adrii16,08/26/2019,Confused about intake and weight gain,"Hello everyone
I've recently started true recovery from anorexia. By this I mean I don't exercise try not to restrict and try to eat a minimum amount a day without using a meal plan. Now I'm about two weeks into eating like this consistently, and totally freaking out. I don't have a problem eating this amount at all, in fact I often eat more. But my main concern is my weight gain. I'm just confused if I should eat like this. Also sometimes I feel like I eat unnecessarily. I sometimes am unable to decide if I want to eat or not, I mostly do eat but these situations just leave me confused and often feeling guilty. Also, if I do continue to eat this amount will I ever stop gaining weight without eating less? Or will I just want less food?

I’ve had a few backslides and relapses since but nothing that lasted longer than a couple of months. Today I found out my mother is putting down my childhood pet in two days and she wants me to be there. I’m having a bit of difficulty coping. I haven’t eaten much in the last few days as I’ve been sick, then I got this news this morning and haven’t eaten anything. It was like 6 pm when while watching TV and crying a little I got the urge to exercise so I immediately popped up and did a bunch of exercises until I was coughing so badly I catch my breath and I felt so lightheaded I was about to pass out. I instantly knew I needed help of some kind because why would I spontaneously start exercising when I haven’t eaten properly in days and am in bed with a cold. But I know it was in response to the stress and that’s just concerning because I’m going away to a different country for college in a week.

113,BitterMeringue,08/13/2019,Feels wrong,"Hello,I'm still trying to gain weight to keep myself out of recovery however in the past week or two it's become increasingly hard due to some troubling thoughts.It's hard enough trying to get my weight up and to be okay with seeing the number increase, even harder still is how guilty my ED voice makes me feel for eating or trying to cut back on the excessive exercising.I feel piggish and gluttonous whenever I eat and It's gotten almost impossible to cope with these feelings as I find myself shutting down when the thought's get loud.I feel like I just need to hear it from others: Is it okay to focus solely on eating and restoring my weight right now?A part of me (I like to think that this part is my more rational side) says that it is okay to be focused on this right now. But another side (the ED voice) says that it's not, and because i'm so focused on it I will gain too much weight and spiral out of control in the other direction.I really can't go back to treatment right now as school starts next week and missing more than two days will result in failed classes regardless of weather I do the work or not.I don't know what I should be focused on right now.

115,tryingtobebrave,08/14/2019,Does it ever end?,"I just had a really disheartening visit with my psychiatrist. She said if my PTSD isn’t any better by my next visit, she wants me to an IOP program for trauma.
I’ve had so much treatment for my mental health, I feel defective and a failure, more than before. It makes me feel like some hopeless case because five years ago I was in a residential program for trauma. It helped so much and I’m nowhere near where I used to be, but my symptoms keep persisting. My life is nowhere near where others my age are, I haven’t made very many of the normal “life” goals or achievements. I had finally gotten to a point where I stopped letting that bring me down, but now it’s nagging at me again because of this visit.
I feel like perhaps all the messed up things I was conditioned to believe about myself growing up were true after all. It’s really messing with my head. I feel really disappointed in myself. I want so badly to turn to drugs or eating disorder behaviors. But I’m trying to feel my way through it instead and tolerate the feelings.
Savedbygrace, I’m taking to heart what you told me last night, and accepting my feelings for what they are and meeting myself where I am instead of avoiding them/ numbing out or pretending to be fine.

I see her tomorrow and I am not nervous because I know I am doing what I am supposed to be so my therapist will be happy and so will my nutritionist. I am just trying so hard. feel I am eating so much.

I also realize I am in a different situation and it is healthy for me to gain as it is for my health. I also have a coworker who admits she has an eating disorder but posts it all over facebook and my coworkers the other day at work were talking about how she gets so stressed and stuff and they were like oh well she has an eating disorder and I wanted to be like well I have one so how do you feel about that. I am just private at work a couple people know but beyond that no one they comment on my size sometimes. this person also claims to be in recovery when her posts to me clearly state otherwise and she admitted to me privately how much she eats... also maybe her behavior in her classroom is because of it my therapist tells me I cannot do my best when I am in my eating disorder so maybe that is some I feel kind of bad my coworkers talked about it but I also felt it was a judgement on eating disorders.,_admin_moderator,"Tue,08/13/2019-1:17pm",Resources ,"Hi, hermione3.

118,fightingbee,08/09/2019,A few questions about recovery and weight gain,"Hi!
My mind is once again full of questions and I was wondering whether some of you can tell me about their experiences with those things. I'm just going to list all my questions here:- How do you know you've reached your set point? Currently, I can't believe that there will come a point at which I will just stop gaining weight when I continue eating like this (loads and loads of ""bad"" aka high fat/calorie foods)- When is it okay to exercise so that I won't be all flabby when I am weight restored? I was never a compulsive movement - person so that is not an issue, but I know you're not supposed to exercise early in recovery.- The most important question: is it true that the more weight you gain, the better the mood will be? Will this come at a certain point or only once a healthy weight is reached? Is it just about general mood or do the feelings towards food/yourself/etc also become better or more relaxed or normal?- Is the amount of time one was underweight ""linked"" to the amount of time it takes for weight to redistribute evenly? -Does the amount of time someone restricted/was underweight ""determine"" how much food someone needs in recovery? So, does someone who restricted for a very long time need more food because there are more internal repairs to be made as opposedto someone who was only ill for a relatively short period of time?- Do things like extreme fatigue and night sweats happen to everyone? And if so, do they set in early in recovery or later?- How long until the extreme hair loss levels out? -Does one gain weight differently when eating healthy foods as opposed to ""unhealthy"" ones?- What is full recovery to you? What does it feel like?-Is/was there something that helped you to truly let go of the ill persona and all that comes with your eating disorder?

119,Pikachoo,08/11/2019,Food Anxiety Getting Worse,"Hey, everyone. Pretty new here, but I’ve been in recovery for about five years. Was just hoping to get some advice on something here. I’m still in recovery and I’ve been physically great and mostly okay emotionally, but I’ve noticed my food anxiety coming back recently. With things like alcohol or fatty foods, the anxiety is mainly because I feel like it’s everywhere and there is no consent to my part on having it be there or what is expected of me with it. It’s inescapable and I’m socially forced to interact with it in some way, for lack of a better way to explain what I feel. I’ve had my consent (in this context) breached multiple times, from parents being strict about food and refusing to believe my dietary restrictions for years to close friends insisting I’m “socially 'effed'” if I’m afraid of alcohol (their words) to an emotionally abusive friend who would constantly berate me and scrutinize everything I did. Other than forced exposure (not effective in this case, as I’m comfortable with the act of drinking and going to stuff like parties because I’m willingly going, and also it’s expensive), any other strategies to manage this anxiety and hopefully be comfortable with food and alcohol in general? Any advice or emotional support in this would be great. Thanks for listening.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,08/12/2019-8:32pm","Hi, Pikachoo! Welcome! We are","Hi, Pikachoo! Welcome!

120,jester,08/07/2019,Another update,"Things haven't changed much here. I went to therapy tonight and my therapist apologized and seemed to inderstand why her behavior upset me - assuming a mediating role without properly hearing my feelings - although I wasnt and am not able to my feelings about it more.
I didnt speak to my dad who gave me a ride there and back. Earlier today we had some conflict... I dont need to go into detail here but he was being condescending, as are both my parents, which I told him and he apologized for. I dont like the position I'm in or how I'm being treated. Oh well.
I was woozy and tingly (bad circulation) today; I must have been undereating. I am eating now. My friend, the one who is moving away, just invited me over tomorrow and immediately I wanted to stop eating. I realize leaving the house and social situations are big triggers. I always want to restrict in anticipation of unfamiliar places and situations where I don't know what or how much I will eat. Trying to continue eating now. I really hope tomorrow I am able to be brave. My friend mentioned a drink he got today and I would love to have one but it is definitely a big fear food. I cant imagine getting  it and not ""compensating"" by restricting. Actually that reminds me, earlier I compensated POSITIVELY by adding more food to my snack because I knew I'd been undereating. it was only a tiny bit but a surprising victory when normally compensation is negative and restrictive. But also thats a stark contrast to how I feel now after making social plans...
It will be hard to get back on track after undereating as I have been, because that means giving up on the physical symptoms its caused which are validating and morbidly satisfying. But hopefully tomorrow I will feel committed to eating. I may need to tell myself: I still havent made up for the entire day of eating I missed!Thank you all for your support.

I’m in such a dark place right now, I just want to crawl in a hole and stay there. It occurred to be last night the potential consequences of not getting this exam sooner after something a couple years ago. I feel like I’m crawling in my skin, I hate my being in my body and I do NOT want to nourish it. Unless I binge until it hurts to punish it. Arghhh I haven’t felt this messed up in a long while. Even with the grief over my grandmas death and papa being in horrible pain from his burns, those things hurt terribly, but it didn’t make me feel like there was something fundamentally damaged and warped inside me and that I don’t deserve anything. Anyway I scheduled an appointment with my therapist for the day after on Thursday morning. I guess it’s that one spark of survival fighting to keep on my recovery journey that got me to make the appointment. Otherwise I would just keep spiraling.

I have worked hard to stop my binge/restrict cycle, and am near a healthy weight now after years of hard work. I noticed since starting a weight lifting program i feel an urge to restrict due to the scale having natural fluctuations. My healthy mind knows that gaining is normal, but I keel feel urges to restrict. What is the best way to deal with restriction urges? I am considering journaling, self talk, and distraction like reading a fun book.I've just come so far, and I know that restricting will set me back to my previous unhealthy cycle.

123,alwaysthinking,08/06/2019,Frustration,"I don't even know how to begin. I messed up. I had gone 12 days with no eating disorder behaviors and I messed up. I was feeling frustrated and overwhelmed and very depressed and one part of me was wanting to restrict and not eat at all and instead I ended up eating with the intent of just eating a little bit and ended up overeating. And as soon as I decided that I was going to overeat , I knew that I had to take a laxative. This was not due to constipation this was a deliberate purgatory thing. Is that the right wording? Well hopefully you all know what I mean. I'm so frustrated with myself and at the same time , there's a part of me that just doesn't care. I just feel at a loss. Even though I know what the end goal is and I am a fighter and I do not want to let Satan win, I am having a really difficult time fighting him. It feels like I have the whole world on my back and I just can't do it anymore. It feels like it would be so much easier just to give in to the eating disorder and say fine take me I don't care. I was doing so well emotionally for over a month and I really thought this was the Breakthrough I've been needing and wanting forever. I don't understand this I don't know why this has happened. Today has been awful. I just want to crawl in a hole and hide their forever. I want to curl up in a ball and go nowhere and yet I already went shopping for a friend this morning and I was going to go in the ministry this afternoon but my ankle made other decisions for me. It's still giving me issues after four to five days of hurting so I finally made an appointment with my doctor to get it looked at. This evening is the day that I go to my friends' house  for dinner and the broadcasting that we'll all be watching and I'm still partly terrified about that. Everything is just snowballing around me and I really want to cave in and just say forget it I can't do it you win. And yet, I know I can't. I don't know what to do. Other than pray. Which I've been doing. And I'll continue doing. And cry. A lot. Hopefully my new therapist will have some insight on Thursday.

125,iwanttolive,08/01/2019,tryingtobebrave,"Hello friend.  How are you doing.  Being alone for the first time does bring up a number of feelings.  There were times I was with people and I was afraid that someone was in the dorm and felt scared.  So I identify with those fears.  And the fact that is has been a long time since you were left alone, it is probably natural that you will have more fear than you thought you would have.  I think it is a good thing that you are growing and learning about yourself and what you need.  There is no shame in feeling scared and realizing what a difference it makes to have someone around.  How has it been since you last posted?  Are your parent's back yet?  I am really proud of you for the way you are dealing with all that you are going through.  I am finding myself falling into a depression due to all that is going on in my life and my families life in the past months.  And more so in the past few weeks.  I did wind up overeating and feel that I lost my fourteen months of no behaviors but I know that I didn't have a full binge, I did overeat but am back on track.  Counting time for being behavior free can be a good thing but there are also some negative parts to it as we can tend to beat ourselves up if we slip a little and thing that that means we have fallen and have to start all over again.  I do not believe this but parts of me do.  In reality, what I am going through, and you as well, is meant to strengthen our faith and build character and give us more of a backbone as we firmly plant our feet on The Solid Rock.   We were never promised things would be easy.  Quite the contrary, we were promised that we would suffer various trials and sorrows, but to not lose Hope as He is with us and will help us and give us what we need as we depend on Him.I have thought of giving up lately.  But I know that is the depression talking.  I resolve to not give up and to take things one day at a time and to not start thinking, my mother just had three strokes, two minor, one not so minor, and a stint put in her main artery, due to severe blockage.  I can worry that she is going to have another stroke, or heart attack, or trust that God is in control and has my Mom, my sister, me and all our family in His hands and golly it isn't easy.  So, enough about me...how have you been doing?  You said you were struggling with thoughts of self harm.  How are those thoughts now?  Please post anytime you need support.  We are here for you.

126,tryingtobebrave,08/04/2019,Negative ,"I do not recognize myself right now. I am angry, scared, and just in a consistently negative mindset.

129,alwaysthinking,08/01/2019,One of those days,"Do you ever have one of those days when you have all sorts of things planned because you really have nothing that you need to do so you plan lots of great things to do and then something happens to completely derail you? I'm having one of those days. The last two days I had my vestibular migraines again. That's just a fancy way of saying I get vertigo whenever I get a migraine. That's why I had to see the neurologist on Monday. Anyway, because I had those migraines I had to stay in bed for the majority of the morning and got very little accomplished. I had intended to do my Ministry those mornings and couldn't. It was frustrating and I was able to stay in a good mood anyway because I knew that Jehovah God understood and I did what I had to do to take care of myself because I knew that this was not my fault and there was nothing I really could do about it except for lay down and take my medicine and wait for it to go away. So today, I had intended as long as I didn't have one of those pesky migraines again, to call on my return visits that I teach about the Bible, do some exercise, do some things for a friend, and other ways to keep myself occupied throughout the day. Instead, my ankle last night decided to change my plans for me. I twisted it or something and it has been giving me a hassle last night and today. So all I'm able to do today is rest with my ankle propped up and ice on it on and off. And while when I have my migraines I'm able to stay in a good mood, today for some reason I'm not. I'm in a crummy mood. I am bored to an extent. I know there's still activities I could be doing and it just feels like they are meaningless and I don't want to be doing them. I'm trying to stay upbeat and it's not working. Worst of all, I'm really having a lot of restriction urges. I almost didn't eat one of my meals / snacks because my stomach has been giving me fits with my on and off constipation. And then finally I was able to sorry I know gross out. And even though I just ate a sort of lunch, one part of me is wanting to eat stuff that Is not really good for me and another part is just not wanting to eat period. So this frustrates me as well and I'm going batty just staying  around the apartment all day when there's so much I could be doing and just can't because my ankle is saying no, no, no! I don't even know what I'm trying to accomplish with this post I just felt the need to vent and rant but it seems more like a ramble. Sorry. I guess my biggest reason was because of the urges to restrict and also the urges to eat stuff that I probably shouldn't.

132,hermione3,07/24/2019,facing difficult issues,Really rough therapy session...its always hard to delve into the emotional abuse of my parents and what role they play in my eating disorder like how on vacations we will eat not in a like really normal way yet my parents are aware of my eating disorder and should know I have to eat more. My therapist pointed out a lot of things that just hurt and like she said with my sexual abuse it is easier to see it is wrong. my parents are like underhanded almost like it sneaky ways that they get to me and how they act and also with my eating disorder I always wanted them to notice me and they still don't. when I was really sick my friends brought me to the hospital not them. It's a tough subject and she pointed out things I know but it made me cry it was just hard to hear it and she really thinks I need to spend less time with them because my other abusers are out of the picture. my parents even if they can seem ok and things are ok it is not real it is fake and full of lies. it was just so hard and I have weekend plans with them for my birthday and my it is against treatment advice. it was just really hard to hear those realities and she thinks I will be able to let go of my eating disorder if I don't keep letting myself get retraumatized. like other abuse I can see the emotional stuff far more difficult to like pinpoint and say it is that bad. but my therapist said it is that bad and the more we talk about it she sees it.,_admin_moderator,"Mon,07/29/2019-8:20pm",Resource ,"Hi, hermione3.

133,alwaysthinking,07/27/2019,Social awkwardness,"I've always felt very socially awkward. In school, growing up, in college, as an adult. I never really had the opportunity to learn appropriate social cues because I was never really allowed to be around people my age. Hence, because I was always expected to take care of my parents from Age 4 on, I never had the opportunity to learn what it's like to develop properly and learn normal social cues. So I've been stunted , so to speak in my social growth in so many ways and now that I've been invited to a social Gathering that is upcoming in August, I feel I've already made several faux pas, and the one that I made today is freaking me out and causing me to want to binge or at least overeat. I know that the first two probably weren't that big of a deal because it has to do with the dinner that is going to be part of the shindig. I simply told the hostess two types of food that I don't eat. I didn't get into the why. I didn't feel that was necessary. I'll mention it here just to show my reasoning on the matter. I used to eat one of these food groups until I developed my eating disorder but I was really picky on it and then once I had my eating disorder I stopped eating it completely. I had stopped eating it for so long that when I tried to eat it again, it made me sick. I thought it may have been a one-time fluke and so I tried it a second time and it made me sick again so I simply tell people I do not eat that food group. The other food group I simply have never eaten because it makes me nauseous even to smell it. At any rate, I knew enough of social cues not to need to go into this and just simply told my hostess that I do not eat these two food groups. I was half joking half apologetic when I told her this and said I hate being so picky. Which is true. Because I am an extremely picky eater which really has nothing to do with my eating disorder. I always have been an extremely picky eater. I had someone joke one time that I have another mental disorder. Picky eating disorder! I liked it! It fits. But the social cue that I wonder that I may have stumbled over today and that I keep on ruminating about and is driving me absolutely bonkers is that she had invited me over as well to watch a religious program that comes out every month for us and when I watch it at home, in order for me to be able to concentrate on it I have to do something else at the same time like crocheting or exercising or both or some active activity. I was worried that if I just went over there and sat and watched it I would get nothing out of it. I know she's pretty much the same way so I asked her today if she minded when I came in August if I brought my crochet stuff. She seems kind of hesitant which makes me wonder if I went too far by asking. She qualified it by saying she didn't care but she wondered about the kids getting into it because she has a two and a five year old. I don't see an issue with them and it just makes me wonder if I just am being too obsessive and nitpicky or what. and the thing that's bothering me the most is that I'm wanting to turn to food to get through this stressful moment.

134,iwanttolive,07/28/2019,Hope,"Hi friends,I just want to say how thankful I am for the Hope that I have.  That Hope is my faith.  That no matter what I am going through, even if I get depressed because of the trials, and need to get extra support, that I know I am going to be okay.  I am thankful that my  Mom is okay.  But what if she wasn't?  I know that even then I know I would be okay.  How some of you may ask?  Because I know that my stability doesn't come from my parent's or anyone else, but in my Lord.  I have faced many difficult and painful things.  I continue to as many of you do.  We will continue to until we die ourselves.  Just because I call myself a Christian, I am not promised as some of you may have heard the term, a rose garden.  In fact, I am promised that I will go through difficult times, tribulations, pain and suffering, loss.  But to not fear and to trust, and to know that Jesus will help me through these times.  In the past I didn't have the ability to put into action what I believed to be true.  I am learning more and am getting stronger as I heal and press into Him.   I am glad to be alive.  I am glad that I want to live.  I never did.  I always wanted to die.  I was afraid of everything.  I am thankful for the growth I have experienced this past year.  That my roots are growing deeper into trusting and believing.  I had a scare this week with the thought that I could have lost my Mom-my friend.  I don't know what tomorrow holds, except that I know I will be okay.  Not without pain and sorrow, but okay.I have enjoyed sharing my journey with you.  To see the hard work you put into the process of healing and recovery.  Growing through the slips and setbacks.  Sharing with each other your dreams and fears.   The struggles and the triumphs.   We all have a story.  Each and every one of us. We get to be involved in writing part of the story.  That is a good thing.  I am so proud of you guys/gals.

135,lovetowrite81,07/24/2019,Psalm 4:8,"""In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, Lord, make me dwell in safety."" Psalm 4:8.I have been reflecting on this a lot this week as I go through Psalms- how we try to seek safety and security in so many things that don't really provide the peace we are looking for. I know for me I have tried to create a sense of security in only eating certain foods/restricting, getting to a certain weight/my body looking a certain way, trying to seek re-assurance and certainty from my boyfriend/in my relationships, filling my schedule with more things/trying to stay busy and engage in meaningful work.But at the end of the day, clinging onto all of these things are just attempts to shield myself from painful emotions and intense fear- and it is only until I am willing to stop turning to my eating disorder or other forms of escape- and am willing to face the sadness and anxiety and pain as they come- that there can be growth and healing.It's been powerful to think about-- how ED might feel safe to us because it's all we've known for so long but it's really only an illusion. It may be temporarily numbing the pain but is really only delaying the process of feeling it. Only in the Lord do we have complete safety- there is refuge in His unchanging, unfailing love. I hope that everyone can feel courageous in taking one step away from clinging to ED and into trusting that they can surrender even in the midst of fear this week <3",_admin_moderator,"Mon,07/29/2019-8:22pm",Medical Signs and Symptoms,"For precaution we just wanted to post up some signs and symptoms to look out for.A person does not have to be underweight to have an eating disorder or to require emergency medical care for one.

136,Mmarij,07/24/2019,Is it a habbit?,"Last year I started my recovery from anorexia and orthorexia and I could tell that I was healing with everyday. I was not afraid of food I ate and do not categorised food anymore. After sometime I started to have episodes when I eat lots of food in one sitting. That food contained lots of sugars due to the reason I was restricting everything that was sweet in the past. These binging episodes repeated about 4 months almost every week. I don't remember actually how I stopped to do that but for almost 7 months I do not have those urges to sit and eat everything around me. I was eating reguraly but I was scared If i puted some extra bites in my mouth. So I also wasn't happy with my relationship with food. I use physical activities to maintain my weight and was feeling guilty everytime I  missed gym session. Almost four months ago I started to prepare for my final exams and my binges comeback. Whenever I started to learn these urges hit me and I was feeling guilty afterwards. My weight is normal, I still exercise, but now I started to do that i really like it and listen to my body more. I believe in moderation and let myself to have some treats daily, my calorie intake is quite high but I still binge every weak. At first i thought binges are caused by stress but exam session is over long ago and I still eating compulsive repeatedly.

137,tryingtobebrave,07/22/2019,Feeling down,"It’s been a rough day from when it first started. I thought it was kind of weird that the surgeons office didn’t confirm my appointment, so I called when I got up to make sure, and they said I wasn’t on the schedule. That whoever made my appointment didn’t save it or something. So now I go next Monday. My mom told me after that appointment, we’re going to see my grandpa out of town again. I told her my therapist thinks I shouldn’t go again, because I didn’t cope well last time and almost caused a mental breakdown. (I didn’t bring up the substance abuse though). She said she won’t go without me. She won’t leave me at the house by myself while they’re on the trip. I told her I won’t let her blame me for not going. I’m a grown woman, I haven’t had thoughts of harming myself in a long time, my therapists think I’m stable enough at home to stay here alone. It caused this big argument. She went on to say how can I stay here alone when I do nothing. She went on to list all the ways I’m lazy and “don’t do *curse*”. So that made me feel pretty bad about myself. I guess that solid fortress of knowing my worth isn’t as solid as I thought.  I know I shouldn’t let her get to me but it did. She made me feel like I’m just lazy and weak for not being able to function with the pain and fatigue. “Everyone gets tired” “everyone has pain”. Like yeah, I’m just going to get my jaw sawed off and put back together by a surgeon because I have a little bit of pain. But whatever, I’m just a wimp right?? I’m having terrible vertigo today from forgetting to take a medication last night. So I’m lying down trying to keep my head still. But maybe I’m just being lazy. Argh. I’m just feeling really down about things. I hate how ptsd makes little stressors seem like the end of the world. Just needed to get this off my chest.

138,tryingtobebrave,07/22/2019,"Guilt, pain, lost","Something I posted earlier about today, was my therapist and dietician suggesting I don’t go visit my grandfather again so soon because of how I was barely able to cope with it. Even with substance abuse making me out of it most of the time, and spending a lot of time at the hotel or driving around with my dad, it still took a big toll on my mental health when I came back.
So my mom has proceeded to tell me that they won’t go if I don’t, that she won’t leave me at the house alone. I don’t know if my dad will be able to get her to come around or not. But this is not the first time she’s done something like this. I’ve been the scapegoat of the family for a lot of situations, and I’m not going to play that part anymore. Rationally I know she’s afraid of losing her father, maybe it’s easier for her to use my as an excuse not to go than to have to see him in pain from his burns.
I also know he wouldn’t want me to jeopardize my mental health.
But I’m also worried my mom will tell my aunts that I’m the reason she didn’t go. They’re already upset with her for not having stayed longer last time. So then the rest of the family would end up alienating me and blaming me. See? Scapegoat. But I don’t want to lose the closeness with my extended family. I don’t want to deal with all the fallout that comes from being the scapegoat.
I know at the end of the day what matters is what I think of myself. The truth of the matter is, whether it’s my moms manipulation or not, I do feel so guilty for not going to see him again next week. Everyone says I’m strong and brave but that doesn’t feel remotely true right now. I feel like a coward. I feel weak. I feel like a worthless granddaughter who can’t be what he needs me to, after the love me showed me that I couldn’t receive from my own father. My heart is shattering into a million pieces. It could mean that the last time I saw him, will be the last time I ever get to. My mom will resent me for the rest of her life if he dies before she sees him again. But i will resent me too, if I don’t shut down entirely. I feel like a horrible person, with a weak, cowardly, stupid worthless mind. I feel like I’m drowning in my guilt and pain and trying to stay afloat. Honestly I’m embarrassed for looking for validation or support or encouragement. But if anyone after reading this believes I’m not a guilty horrible person for not being able to go, please say so.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,07/23/2019-2:50pm",Resources ,"Hi, tryingtobebrave.

139,fightingbee,07/23/2019,coping with a changing body,"Trigger warning: talking about underweight body Hi again. Sorry, I really like posting here - this place makes me feel understood and like I'm not alone. This is for everyone who's made it through the weight gain part of recovery and can or wants to give some helpful advice to someone currently undergoing the struggle. I have gained quite a lot of weight since the beginning of my recovery, but I'm not nearly there yet and still have some kilos to go. But I'm out of the ""danger zone"", so yay! I know this is good (great actually) and necessary, but it's also hard to deal with. Only 2 weeks ago I was really thin. I am always a bit startled when i touch my shoulders, for example, and suddenly there is flesh. I'm unable to look at or touch my face. And I'm terrified because I know that I'm not nearly there yet and there are going to be so many more changes and there'll come a day when my face will be even more filled out. I really don't know how to cope. I really want recovery and while I'm not enjoying it right now and am scared s**tless of the changes and not knowing at which weight I'll settle, what I'll look like, I want to push through and reach a healthy weight ( no matter what the evil voice in my head says) I hope that once I'm there, I'll be able to accept myself anyways. But getting there is not easy. How do or did you cope with the changes? With feeling utterly disgusting, like you're the ugliest person in the world, like you're huge? And how do you deal with no longer ""feeling yourself"", with parts of your body suddenly touching, there being flesh on you? Do you have any tips despite just sitting with it and waiting it out?

140,BitterMeringue,07/18/2019,Sister setting off triggers,"Sorry for posting so frequently, I just have a lot of things I need to talk about.
Lately my younger sister (11) has been talking about wanting to be a model. This in itself is extremely triggering and difficult to hear her talk about as I am aware of how in many cases models themselves struggle with their food relationships.
If I were in a better place with my recovery I feel that I would be able to handle this better but unfortunately I am not.
I've noticed a decline in her eating lately as well, which again, is extremely triggering as I have been struggling with getting all of my planned meals and snacks in as I need to get back to a healthy weight.
Even worse is the fact that my parents are aware of this and don't view it as a problem, in fact, the almost seem to be supporting it.
This is extremely damaging to my mental state as they too learned about the effect models can have on individuals with an eating disorder while I was in treatment, yet when I bring up my concerns to them they get angry with me and tell me that i'm overreacting or that i'm ""Sick"" and shouldn't even be talking to my sister.
I really don't want to go back to inpatient care but it seems like that may be the only way i'll truly get through this relapse. My home doesn't feel safe anymore and I feel like I have no where to go and nobody to talk to.
Does anyone have any tips on how I should deal with this? I'm not an adult yet so I can't leave or admit myself into a treatment facility. I'd like to stay home but if i'm going to do that i'll need some new coping strategies as the one's i've been using no longer work.
I am very afraid for not only myself but my younger sister to.

141,iwanttolive,07/14/2019,trials and an update on things happening ,"In recovery and living life, and for me, as a Christian; trials come and death comes and pain and confusion and mistreatment and being judged and ignored and told what to do...you get the point.  I have been dealing with so many emotions and anger and anxiety and depression.  Some of it is because I am not trusting God.  That He is with me, my sister and He knows all things.  Learning to trust and to feel but to not live in my feelings as I have been is a learning experience that really only happens when going through the valley of the shadow of death.  This could be a real death, or the death of a relationship, or of a dream, or of serious illness.  Of a valley of not being treated right.  Of not being heard. Of being made to look foolish, of always being challenged about a lot of things I say.  Feeling alone and lonely and the physical limitations I have because of the pain.  In all of this, and this has been especially pronounced this month, but a lot of it has been on going for years, I am still learning how to process my emotions, pain and seeing what happens when I don't bring things to God and hold onto resentment and anger.  Anger I believe a lot of times has roots stemming from fear.  And I know what to do with this fear.  But I have been allowing all these intense emotions dictate my mood.  I know better.  I know that I with God's help, am in control of my mood.  That the thoughts I think and the things I dwell on affect my mood.  God says whatever is lovely, of a good report, right, worthy of praise, think on these things-Philippians 4:8.  This is not easy to do when the emotions of negativity are swirling all around me.  But if and when I allow myself to dwell on the problems, allow the fear to grow, focus all day on what if my sister dies, how I am always being challenged, this does something.  It makes me more depressed and hopeless.  Then I started feeling like I really wanted to die.  But then I said that would really not be good for anybody.  What I need to do is stand on The Rock, stand firm in my faith, and trust.  Talk about how I am feeling instead of isolating.  Do the things that I know work and don't do the things that will cause me to fall deeper into the pit.  It has been an extremely difficult time and even though I have been feeling so desperate and like I want to give up, I have let go of the anger.  I am trying to trust God more.  I have felt a physical sense of relief from the anger after a good talk with my Mom.  I have not used behaviors.  I have not gone backwards in terms of my eating. But I did return to feelings of extreme anger and anxiety.  I did allow myself to isolate.  I did not do what I know will help.  But this learning process WILL make me stronger and will be al learning experience and will be used for good.  I will NOT give in to the voice that says, oh why not...go ahead and just do this a little, it will make you feel better.  NO it won't and it won't take away the circumstances and the emotional pain.  Standing firm, talking, opening up, reading my Bible, doing what it says to do.  This is the answer for me.  It doesn't mean I am not going to feel angry, or sad, or depressed or anxious, but it does mean it will not take me.  I don't have to be swallowed up in the hurricane.  I can make it through the storm.  I don't know if any or you read through all of this.  It was for me, but also for any of you who were able to read through all of this to know that life happens.  Life hurts.  But it doesn't have to dictate to us how we will respond, or act.  We get to choose that.  I get to choose that.  So, I choose life and iwanttolive and I will.  I am loved by One Who holds me close in the storm.

142,BitterMeringue,07/08/2019,Recovery Stressors,"I've recently decided to come here to get some help and feedback from people who have recovered/are recovering and have maybe gone through some of what I am currently experiencing.
I've had anorexia for almost 3 years now, I received serious treatment last year and was holding steady up until a few months ago. I've fallen back into my ways and am now down to hospitalization weight. I think i'll make my weigh in tomorrow and I truly do want to eat more to gain some of the weight back but I find that this time around i'm struggling badly with body image mainly concerning my stomach.
I'm aware that bloating happens and I can usually tell when that is the case, however i've also looked into weight redistribution and haven't found a solid answer. I'm very afraid that my stomach will begin to protrude and I will get a large tummy once I begin to eat enough to really gain weight. I'd be okay with this if I knew that it would redistribute evenly eventually.
I do work out (or at least usually do, I've decided to wean off for now) so I think that will help with the toning but I'm just not sure.
I want to love my body for how it's supposed to look.
I'm 14 years old.
Can anyone give me any tips or advice for dealing with this part of weight restoration?
Does anyone have any facts that could help to ease my mind?
I really fear a re-lapse as the city in which I live is terrible when it comes to health care and I nearly died the last time they threw me in the Psychiatric unit. If I don't get back to a healthy weight they will send me back to the unit and I genuinely fear what the outcome will be.
I no longer have the support of my parents, they assured me that they will no longer support or help me with my recovery anymore.
Some facts and tips on recovery and how to deal with it would be extremely helpful right now.

144,tryingtobebrave,07/15/2019,In a dark place mentally ,"Today was been horrible. There’s a few things that just escalated my feelings until I had a melt down. First, my grandpas house is so hot that it even bothers him, it’s almost not safe despite the numerous fans. I hope they take him to my aunts house or get a portable air conditioner which they were working on doing.
My mom has been acting weird too which stresses me out badly despite it being a normal reaction, her being sick over upsettting situations or stress or whatever is a huge trigger to my ptsd. One of the worst, that has me hiding in a fetal ball of closet. It’s not her reaction or even her. It’s just a background thing that happened during a trauma, and it’s the insignificant detail my brain picked up on.
And the worst part of all is I went to Colorado since it was only 30 minutes away with my dad and we got high together. It’s not part of my opioid addiction, but it still feels wrong especially with everything else. It was legal but it still felt wrong because someone in recovery. I will say that it had a huge impact on my pain, that was literally the first time in years that I wasn’t in pain.
But I lies to my mom about it, they were all in that hot house during that time my dad and I were away, I feel like I should have been helping my grandpa more but there wasn’t the type of things I could do that I didn’t already yesterday. He just needs a lot of rest more than anything to heal his body. And yeah, it’s hard for me to be around him in pain and so weak like that. He’s he person I love most, and beyond praying, there’s nothing I can do to take it away. It’s excrucating. And being around my mom ina bad mood and possibly sick made it worse.
So now, we just shared a meal all together then my dad took my back to my hotel room for the rest of the day, to get out of heat, and away from my mom being a trigger even though the fear has nothing to actually do with her. I hate ptsd.
And I hate myself. I know I was going to try to be easy on myself but I feel like I’ve been worthless and shameful this entire trip. My mental weaknesses have kept me from being a better granddaughter or even a better human being in general. I just want to go home tomorrow like we’re going to in the afternoon and hide in my bed. I feel so dark. I do have my last appointment with eating disorder therapist and dietician Thursday so at least I’ll be leaving the house to get out once.

145,tryingtobebrave,07/14/2019,Not coping well with trip so far ,"Today was day one of two, then Wednesday we come back. My mom was frantic and stressed and worried, which compounded my own anxiety and I wasn’t able to get space from it for a while, so I took too much of my anxiety medication. I didn’t have eating disorder behaviors or give into urges to exercise, but I did abuse my anxiety medication by taking too much to numb my panic thoroughly. Then I slept for several hours and my grandpas house until he came home. I’m glad I was sedated honestly and I feel ashamed for this but I almost crumpled at the sight of him. He looks so fragile and broken. Not to mention, that I’m sure it was traumatizing for him. So now I’m back at the hotel, resting. They only had separate rooms without the connecting door this time which is a relief because I feel like I can breathe and not be stressed by my moms stress. Being around her when she’s worried or upset while we’re traveling is a huge ptsd trigger. And another thing I’m ashamed of, is I snuck an extra anxiety pill for tomorrow so I can one extra than my prescription allows to get through the day and sleep. I feel like a horrible worthless piece of garbage right now. I have so many negative things swirling through my mind.
The two positives are i can tell my aunts really love me and care about me because they ask me questions about my struggles, and knowing how hard this is for me right now. I wanted to cry at their kindness. I know they love me. And seeing my Papa, despite the state he is in, calmed the storm inside of me for a while. And my mom does try to help me get through this the best she can, like she told me it’s okay for me to go back to the hotel earlier so I can relax. So I feel even worse for lying to her about taking extra anxiety medication behind her back when she’s kind to me about this. I’m just in a dark spot and feel really lost.

146,amattox,07/02/2019,Struggling ,So I feel like I’m going backwards. I just finished school so I have a lot more time on my hands. I have a lot of stress and my second family is in another state for two weeks. They are like my mom and dad. Most supportive. I think everything is crashing down. I have a physical for a new job so freaking out about stepping on the scale. At the doctor they weigh me backwards. This is a different clinic and I can’t go into my health issues or it could affect my job potential. I’m struggling and pushing myself to eat but nothing sounds good and my focus is switching to weight and calories. I’m so angry with myself because I don’t want to go backwards again.

150,tryingtobebrave,07/09/2019,Growth inspite of struggling ,"Lately, I have been struggling a lot with my PTSD and chronic pain. Both of these things cause feelings of hopelessness in me at times. I’ve been having to be more vigilant in order to not dive back into substance abuse in order to cope with these things. I’ve had a few urges to use behaviors at times. When these things occur, it makes me question if things will ever “really get better”. I bet I’m not alone on the forum in having that thought.
But here’s the thing: that’s a cognitive distortion. When I go back and examine the evidence, I can see so much progress from where I was this time last year in treatment. I would never be able to deal with a triggering event that I’ll be handling next month without using eating disorder behaviors or substance use. I would never have been able to identify my distorted thoughts and come up with a counter thought. And though it doesn’t take away the feeling and symptoms of my PTSD, I learned in trauma therapy what is physically going on in my brain. I can say it aloud to myself as it’s occurring and though it doesn’t change what’s happening, it helps me realize my brain will calm back down in time (sometimes). Yes, I still go through depression and dark moods but I use healthy coping mechanisms rather than addictions and harmful behaviors. I used to have a habit of constantly justifying every thought or action I made, because a core belief I used to have was that I had to justify my existence. I had to prove to others that I wasn’t a waste of space. But that was never true. And I no longer justify myself to others. I still have the urge to at times but I recognize it and use healthy thinking instead. The end result of it being that I don’t hate myself most of the time. I’m actually starting to like parts of who I am. I’m becoming more confident in who I am and I never thought that was possible. I never thought I could recover but I am. Sometimes in the midst of our struggles, we lose perspective on how far we have come. And I will keep telling myself that just because I’m going through a very difficult thing, it does not erase all the growth I’ve made.
Just today, I resisted the urge to justify to my mom that my pain reached a point where I had to go back to bed. I let her say her judgement, and didn’t take it personally. I do what I have to, to cope with where I’m at. It’s enough. It has to be, because I am doing my best.
I just wanted to give an update and hopefully share some hope I experienced today.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/10/2019-6:17pm",Resources ,"Hi, tryingtobebrave.

151,KHaungs22,07/03/2019,Obsessed with Food,"11 years...it's been 11 years since I would consider myself ""recovered"" from my anorexia...but I'm starting to realize that there are sticking points to my experience with that that have held on since. I feel like I've been on an on and off diet since I was in 8th grade, always trying to be in control of my weight since I was a little heaver. Went through my ED, came out on top (by the grace of God! and I'm so grateful), but have been fluctuating with my weight ever since. I'm in this constant state of thinking about food...""when will I eat next?"" ""What will I eat next"" ""I need to eat healthy"" ""I need to eat less"" ""I need to exercise so I can eat what I want"" ""Am I even hungry?"" ""I'm not hungry, but that sounds delicious, I'll have some""I get anxious when I think about my routine gets messed up and I don't know when I will be able to eat next, I get anxious thinking about WHAT I will eat because I don't feel great that day about how I look, my days revolve around food. Not specifically unhealthy food, not specifically anything, but food in general. I could be counting down the minutes until I could eat an apple. Why...after 11 years can I eat the things that I couldn't during my ED, but still be obsessed with when I will eat next?

152,jester,06/27/2019,Hi again!,"I just realized I haven't been on here for two weeks... I thought it had only been 1. I got my wisdom teeth out a week ago, and apparently had already been inactive before that. Well hi again everybody. I skimmed through posts but didn't read them all sorry - Hope everyone is doing ok <3I was concerned my wisdom teeth surgery would be very triggering due to the inability to eat as well as to potential for swelling (right before surgery I started getting insecure about how round my face is and was sure that swelling would worsen that insecurity). But I'm actually doing ok, at least in terms of the eating disorder.I definitely wasn't eating a lot right after surgery, and there was orthorexia problems I am now remembering. But it wasn't That Bad. I did get very depressed for a couple days. I don't know how I'm allowed to talk about this, but in a text to my therapist I said ""I was the highest on the 'danger-to-self' scale I can remember being."" I think I was reacting to the medicine I was given. I was miserable... But not in an eating disorder way so that's good? It's possible the reason food has seemed so easy is because I was undereating but not yet in starvation, so my eating disorder instinct was happy and I wasn't yet suffering the negative consequences... We'll see if things continue to be easy as I return to normal eating. I have been rather hungry so I'll try my best to eat as much as I want. Yesterday I was craving a [treat]. I wasn't able to get it, but I got it today!! The eating disorder thoughts are shockingly manageable. More like what I'm expecting to be afraid of than actually being afraid. There's a little bit of anxiety but very quiet. I was so grumpy this morning but feeling better now. I will try my best not to restrict at all, just to reinforce this lack of fear.Less good is that my mom is on some sort of diet... Hoping she doesn't become too obsessive. I have never known her to diet before.

158,Hezza1506,06/13/2019,Relapse,"I suffered from an eating disorder (EDNOS as it was classified at the time - now would be OSFED atypical anorexia), though I didn't know it until I was undergoing treatment for depression in my early 20s.  I began restricting when I was 12 and the summer that I turned 14 I had only eaten something on 10 days out of the 10 week summer term.  In my later teens a couple of my boyfriends helped me to start eating more normally, but the urge to stop has always been there, and if I'm stressed it gets worse.  For a few years, though, I've very seldom had the urge at all, but then it came back with a vengeance a few weeks ago.Unfortunately, a few days after the urge had returned, I was travelling with a colleague on business and the chef in the hotel we stayed in was off so we couldn't get breakfast before leaving the hotel.  We got stuck in traffic going to our morning meeting so didn't get a chance before it, and while we were in it my colleague received a message to say that he needed to be home by 2pm (personal reasons), so we came out of the meeting and drove straight back without stopping.  As a result, I'd missed both breakfast and lunch, and missing two meals has always been a trigger for me ('I've done this much, I can just keep going'), even without already feeling the urge to skip meals.That was the 10th of May and ever since then I've been battling the urge to stop eating.  I've lost weight since then - that in itself isn't a bad thing because I'm certainly not thin (genuinely not - that's not my ED talking), but it's a bad thing in as much as it hasn't been done sensibly.  I always track my eating but usually have it set to around X calories and stay within that; this last month what I've done instead is set it to X and try to stay *above* that.  I know X isn't enough but it's better than nothing and gives me something to aim for.  If my husband sees I'm not eating then he'll cook me something because he knows I won't waste something he's cooked, so that's helped me stay over that.Last week I was feeling a bit more in control, so I was able to increase my intake. I'm really worried about next week, though - I'll eat pretty normally over the weekend because it's my birthday and I'm going to be surrounded by friends at mealtimes, but next week my husband is going to be away helping his parents move house.  I know I'm going to find it difficult to handle the weekend's eating anyway (it won't be excessive but it'll feel like it after a month of restricted eating), so my husband would usually probably have ended up stepping in somewhere in the first half of next week.  With him away until the following weekend, I don't know what I can do to try and ensure I don't stop eating.  I know a week isn't going to kill me, but I'd rather avoid it if I can.Does anyone have any suggestions?  What do you do to keep yourself on the right path?Thanks",_admin_moderator,"Thu,06/13/2019-11:51am","Dear Hezza1506, we are","Dear Hezza1506, we are writing to let you know that we edited your post to remove mentions of weight and calorie numbers, and disordered eating behaviors, which could be triggering and are not allowed on the forums.

Speaking about this to my roommate she was so stupid in her response, WELLLLLLL the doctorrrrrrsssss  know what they are doing.  Your Mom has been there and knows what is going on and even said that she was getting good care.  I said that was two days ago and this never should have happened today.  The doctor should have been there.  She said, wellllllll, it is the weekend and blah blah blah.  I am so angry.  I told her you have no idea what you are talking about.  My sister should never have suffered the way she did and you have no idea of what you are saying. I wanted to really scream at her and her  comments. I did raise my voice which is not something I do with her but come on, really!!!As for the support given to me, thank you.

161,iwanttolive,06/18/2019,sad,"Hi.  I am writing for some support.  I spent the night in the emergency room the other night and had another episode of not being able to move my body at all except for initially being able to shake my head.  My ability to communicate verbally was there not so good at first and that too went for about six or seven hours.   I stayed in the observation part of the hospital and the next day I was unable to move my legs and hips.  This is due to a disorder I have dysautonomia.  There was also a medication interaction that caused this episode.  I had a similar episode in January.  It was very scary.  Trying all my might to move my body and not being able to.So today I continue to be weak and dizzy and don't feel well and I have to go for more tests and be put on a heart medication.  My blood pressure usually runs very low. My sister just had surgery today.  She has not been able to eat or drink for the better part of a month and before that it has been very painful and she hasn't really eaten much for several months.  Her brain has not been able to communicate with her body to allow her to swallow.  My Grandmother had that happen.  So today she had a permanent J tube put in her.  They had to operate and do extensive work to  put it in.  She was operated on for about two hours.  It has been difficult seeing someone I love suffer and get weaker and weaker.  It reminds me of when I was anorexic and refused to eat and as you all know it goes deeper than just refusing to eat.  There are fears and emotional problems that go along with anorexia that others who can not eat don't have.  She does have a lot of pain in her life.  I hurt for her and I have to learn not to take on her pain as I have always done all my life, the sponge.  It is a possibility that with her condition she could die.  We all have to face this reality and it is difficult.I am feeling depressed as I am not able to go out for walks and do things I usually do, haven't driven in over three weeks because  I am dizzy.   I manage to work four hours three days a week, but it is difficult.  My case is relatively easy so that is good.   I can come home and rest.  I am not always feeling so sick.  But the pain in my body prevents me from being able to go for long walks with my dog, and from cleaning without pain.  My heart hurts in three ways.  One for my sister.  One for real.  And one for the incapacity I have had to live with.  I know others are a lot worse off.  My sister has what I have and she rarely goes out and mostly stays in her bed.  I apologize for going on about this medical stuff.  I will be seeing a nutritionist who will help me reduce the amount of sugar I take in.  It is known that sugar can complicate pain in the body.  I have been doing so well in recovery I am nervous to change things up and be on a more strict eating plan.  I have basically been eating whatever I want and been maintaining my weight and being balanced in my approach, but I need to add in a food category which I do not find enjoyable and reduce the sugar.  I don't want it to get me off track.  Thank you for listening.  I am just feeling lonely and tired and not sleeping well and on and on and on.

162,sophiaggs0,05/30/2019,Still gaining weight after weight restoration ,"I had been suffering from anorexia for about a year and disorded eating for 4-5 years (lots of diets) and I finally decided to get some help last summer.
At first, I started gaining weight very fast even though I was eating normally, or maybe a little bit more than normal, but then again I was very underweight. After a tiny relapse where I restricted a bit, I suffered from extreme hunger and restored completely my weight through that process. I got my period back and the bingeing episodes completely stopped. I settled at a weight that is quite high (according to BMI it was in the ""overweight"" category) but I managed to stay calm about it, putting it on account of the overshoot. About five months ago, my therapist prescribed me antidepressants and I didn't notice any side-effects at first. However, I recently weighed myself and I have gained weight ! I didn't really noticed it at first because my clothing size didn't dramatically change, at most, I would say that my clothes might feel a bit more tight.
I also feel like my eating has gotten quit normal : I don't really have the urge to restrict anymore and I feel free to eat what I want, whenever I am hungry. I don't feel like I am overeating either, but then again I find it a bit hard to know exactly when to stop and I might eat just a bit more than necessary so that I don't get hungry quickly. I also do light exercise and more intensive sports.It really stresses me out and I feel like some ED thoughts are coming back because my treatment team thinks that I should pay more attention to what I am eating. The thing is that I was getting really satisfied with the freedom I had started to feel by allowing myself to respond to my hunger cues and not judge myself for what/how much I was eating. I don't want to go back to a place where I have to think too much about it.I don't know if someone has had any experience similar to mine or knows if the possible weight gain could be due to the antidepressants. Also, what is the best thing to do if the weight keeps piling on ? Should I start noticing and adapting my eating habits which might put me at risk of adopting some unhealthy behaviors again, or wait until my body decides it no longer needs to store fat ?",_admin_moderator,"Thu,05/30/2019-1:09pm","Dear sophiaggs0, we would","Dear sophiaggs0, we would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove weight number, the name of the medication as well as detailed eating disorder behaviors, which are not allowed on the forums.

163,alwaysthinking,05/28/2019,Scared for my life,"So, I've been writing about how terrified I've been to eat, because of how I'm then afraid of other behaviors happening.  I'm rightly scared for my life.  Today I couldn't eat breakfast but after feeling  light-headed again I thought I better eat something . So I had a small snack which terrified me but I knew I needed to. I really wasn't planning on eating anything else today when I was going in the afternoon to various errands I need to run I honestly felt like I was going to black out and that terrified me even more. I don't want to put others at risk while I'm driving and yet I'm still terrified because of so much that's going on in my head. I was afraid that if I went home to eat I would end up feeling like I would binge so I decided to go to a restaurant. That's where I am right now and I'm staring at my food and feeling terrified for my life. I've never been this bad to the point where I really thought I would pass out. It's scary and it's also still scary to eat.I know it's not because of fear of gaining weight.  I'm not thrilled with my weight but I've kind of become accustomed to it. It's more of a fear of feeling like I will then resort to other behaviors that are not beneficial. I'm really tired of the struggle and I'm glad that I'm seeing my eating disorder therapist this afternoon.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,05/28/2019-6:28pm",Medical Help,"Hi alwaysthinking,You mentioned some concerning signs and symptoms.

166,pikar,05/20/2019,food intolerances vs. food freedom,"Hey!Does anybody have experiences/advices how to achieve full food freedom when having food intolerances?I assume that I got these food intolerances because I´ve consumed artificial sweeteners in quite large amounts for years. I´ve read that those compounds can alter the gut flora (therefore, I don´t consume artificial sweeteners since almost 3 years now). Has anybody made similar experiences? I am in recovery from restrictive eating for almost 2 years now and managed to escape the binge-restrict cycle, constant food thoughts and healthy eating obsessions and I´m pretty relaxed around food nowadays. These days I just want to enjoy my regained relaxed relationship with food. The only thing that is holding me back from beeing completely stress-free around food is the fact, that I don´t tolerate certain foods.The problem is, when I eat normal amounts of certain food I get very bad flatulence some hours after the meal. When I eat these products yet multiple times in a day, the flatulences get so bad, that I can´t leave the house anymore because I have to fart constantly (sorry!!).
(Sidenote: I don´t have celiac disease and I don´t think that gluten is the problem. I rather assume that I don´t tolerate inulin (fructose-polymer), because it´s a component of all foods that I don´t tolerate. I observed the symptoms and experimented with eating this type of food for month). However, when beeing on the move or when eating out in a restaurant, I just want to have the convenience to buy/order ""normal things"". I just don´t want to think about food and what I can & cannot eat all the time anymore, like in my disordered eating times - I´m so sick and tired about it!When heading out for eating in a restaurant, I slightly get stressed out because I don´t know if there´s a dish for me to order. If possible, I want to check the menu in advance (just like in disordered eating times). And yet I just want to eat normal things and order the most delicious thing on the menu now that I don´t struggle with disordered eating anymore. Also, when my boyfriend is cooking, I also avoid to eat with him and cook something seperate for myself (just like in my past eating disorder days - it´s so exhausting!).Currently, I also do things like meal prepping, just because I really don´t want to eat unsavoury things all time I´m out and about and it´s the only thing to buy in a normal store that I tolerate and will make me full.Furthermore, I don´t actually want most other people to know that I don´t tolerate certain types of food, because it would be somehow embarassing to me.. Does anyone have a similar problem or any suggestions, how to obtain a relaxed relationship with food despite the intolerance, especially when eating outside or when travelling?Thank you and sorry my question got so long and sorry for my bad english (I hope you get my problem anyway)!P.S.: I also have lactose-intolerance, but that´s no problem for me because there are lactose-free versions of nearly eveything these days and in case I can use this lactase-capsules that help to digest the lactose.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,05/20/2019-3:19pm","Dear pikar, we would like to","Dear pikar, we would like to let you know that we edited postions of your post to remove mentions of specific food, which is not allowed on our forums.

167,hermione3,05/17/2019,feeling like i am just losing the battle...,Everything has just been such a mess this week. I talked to my doctor about the bill too and she said it was a mistake and her billing person should not have sent me a bill and she said I don't have to pay anything and not worry about it. She said I am a special case and she accepts whatever my insurance pays and does not make me pay any extra which I didn't even fully realizes she was doing so that is great because there is no way I could afford her otherwise and she is a specialist for eating disorders. so some ups but then work...always a downer we have been working so hard on our portfolio for accredidation and this woman came in and observed our daycare for like literally no time at all and told our office manager that we are going to fail because of our classrooms. like we are doing terribly and we will not pass...the language of our children is horrible it was everything we are just failing. it felt like we are not working hard enough when i know all the teachers i was with at this meeting work so hard and i work so hard no matter how miserable i am at my job i still work hard. I do as much as I can and I doubt myself on my own now I basically have someone saying it...it hurt and I was really struggling last night because I just felt like I must be doing something wrong if we are going to fail and one of the classrooms she came in was mine she was only there like 2 minutes but honestly all of us felt awful. I am never hungry but I felt I lost any hunger at all last night after that I already doubt my abilities at work. i am so stressed i still have stuff to do for the portfolio which we are trying to get done by June. There is just so much pressure.

169,OhDamnGrapes,05/16/2019,Recovery into binge eating?,"Hi! I've been in recovery (fully committed recovery) since January this year, and I've been doing pretty well! I'm trying to listen to my hunger cues and eat intuitively.
But a habit I can't break is randomly snacking all day. Like, every time I open the fridge, I grab some food. Every time I open de pantry, I grab snacks.
I'm not worried about how many calories I'm eating extra because of this, but I know it's not a healthy way of eating.I'm trying to practise mindful eating, but I'm having such a hard time. I have this strange food obsession and when I get hungry or want to eat, I get into a haze where I can't think clearly anymore. I forget all the mindful practises and just eat. Especially breakfast is a problem for me, I love breakfast! But I always have to eat it on my own with no one around and I get so nervous when I eat breakfast. Also I always keep snacking after meals.I noticed that it's really the small foods I eat all the time, I think it's so that my family doesn't really notice it when I eat these.Is this binge eating?

170,alwaysthinking,05/12/2019,Failure/giving up,I feel like such a failure and a hypocrite. I just can't follow the same advice that I give everybody else. I can't be my own cheerleader. I know all the right things to do and anxiety is crippling me and making it impossible. I've already compensated a couple of ways and done entirely too much of what I'm not supposed to do. I truly feel like giving up. I've restricted like crazy both yesterday and today. I haven't even eaten yet today and really don't care if I ever eat again. Yes I've said that before and I just keep getting at my Breaking Point. I am hoping and praying that things will improve because I know that Jehovah God will never let me endure more than I can handle.  And yet it feels like I have nothing in me to be able to endure.  Frustrated and disgusted with myself. I feel like such a failure and yet I simply can't do anything about it right now. I'm always appreciative of the support I get here and yet right now I don't think I'm at a place to receive it and I know I'm not at a place to give it. I really just feel like giving up. I'm trying so hard to do the right things and right now it is impossible. I know I am repeating myself a lot and I'm sorry for that. I'm just so overwhelmed that I can't think straight. I don't know what to do anymore except for pray. I know prayer is my biggest coping mechanism and that Jehovah God is stronger than anything I could ever imagine.

171,iwanttolive,05/14/2019,Hope,"Hi all.  I am really excited as I am nearing my one year free of all behaviors.  June will be the one year mark.  I want to let all of you know that recovery is possible, even for those who have suffered for a long time, as I did.  There have been many stressful and painful days, both physically and emotionally.  I have a lot of stress at work recently and it will continue for another month or longer.  But then I have to get used to a new client and the loss of the one I am with now will hurt a lot.  I have been with her for two and a half years and we have grown very close and I also love there dog.  She loves me too and waits for me to come.  I have had to make difficult decisions, have had to deal with difficult circumstances, so although I no longer deal with behaviors, life goes on and with it there is pain.  But I have learned I do not need to turn to the behaviors to help cope with the pain.  I am able to call my Pastor, I can talk with my Mom or Dad but more my Mom, I talk with God, and a few good friends.  The one who moved away we seem to be losing touch more and more as she is busy with her life in the Poconos.  I write this to encourage all of you who feel this will never end.  It can.  It does.

173,alwaysthinking,05/11/2019,Dealing with anxiety,"I'm dealing with a lot of anxiety right now and it's crippling me. It's amazing how something so intangible can paralyze you and make things impossible to do that you either really want to do or feel obligated to do. I was supposed to go to my cousin's today to eat supper and then help her put tags on things for an upcoming yard sale and I was beyond terrified to go and feeling just so anxious that it didn't make any sense. I talked about it with my best friend and he said it was probably because the stuff that's for this yard sale that I am supposed to be helping price are things from my old house that just recently got sold. My mother recently went into the nursing home and has a legal guardian that is trying to run her life and unfortunately mine. She has been progressively getting rid of all of our stuff and we just had, or I should say she just had, an auction to get rid of all the rest of the things in order to pay for my parents care. I'm not too upset about not having these items because my apartment's too small for most of them. It's just the idea of my life being given away to Perfect Strangers. And so this is causing a great deal of anxiety and it's manifesting itself in the eating disorder as well. Just had a grazing session and feel very guilty about it even though I really didn't eat a gigantic amount it just was unplanned and not really time for a snack or a meal. So now I am seriously contemplating compensating in several ways and feeling guilty about that even though I haven't even done it. Just totally freaking out again and really sick of my life being so chaotic and out of control. I feel like it's a disaster Zone. I wish I could be as compassionate to myself as I am to others , but I just expect so much out of myself and imperfection is not acceptable. Of course I know it's impossible to be perfect and yet I can't stop expecting it because it was expected of me for so many years.

174,alwaysthinking,05/09/2019,Not happy,"Not happy in so many ways. My eating disorder is not happy with me because I ate lunch even though I was not wanting to. It really did not make me happy to eat but I was trying to remember all my values and reasons for needing to eat, so I ate. Also, I was very dizzy and lightheaded so I thought I must be dehydrated and need to be eating and drinking more. Of course Maleficent,as I call my eating disorder, isn't happy about that in any way shape or form. Not happy either because my stupid shoulder pain is still interfering with being able to do regular activities and then that makes me panic about not doing enough movement which makes me panic about what I've eaten. It's such a catch-22. It doesn't seem to matter what I do, I'm getting in trouble in some way shape or form. Mainly in my head I know, and unfortunately too much in my body now. I keep wondering if my eating disorder is what has caused so many of my physical problems. It's frustrating because I know I did not deserve any of this. I did not choose to have an eating disorder. I did not choose to have things done to me that caused me to get this eating disorder. I did not choose to do eating disorder behaviors. It's so unfair , and I know that this world is not fair, and it doesn't make it any easier. I don't really know what I'm trying to accomplish in this forum Topic at the moment. I'm just very unhappy and frustrated and tired of everything. It seems like every time I feel like I'm getting ahead and making progress, I back slide and either have insane anxiety because I haven't given into the eating disorder or I give in to the eating disorder in one way shape or form and having anxiety because of that. As I said such a catch-22 and I am not happy. Yesterday I was in a wonderful mood because I was able to do stuff with my friends and in the ministry. It's frustrating when the physical interferes and I'm not able to do that and I get unhappy and lonely and entirely too much in my head. If I've written something similar to this before , I'm sorry.

I finally decided to do something about it at the start of last year, coming to terms with the fact that there would be weight gain etc, however I fell off the wagon perhaps 6 months in, which I now realise was because I wasn't allowing myself to 'eat freely'  (everything I ate was still very healthy and perhaps not enough) and in frustration of being on the heavier side despite all my 'healthy eating intentions' reverted back to binging and purging with a 'whats the point' attitude. This time round I am 4 months into recovery, however the difference between now and last year, is last year I was eating really healthily, not realising the need to eat freely and to eat over X calories. Which I am now doing this year.However,  I only discovered in the last 2 weeks that exercise affects your recovery and have read to not do any at all- which I find quite disconcerting as I do circuit and weight training every week. My gym contract finishes this week and I don't plan to renew it and just to fully commit to recovery. I have spent 4 months eating freely (all different food groups, foods I originally saw as bad, until I am full and sometimes uncomfortably full), have had the joy of all the symptoms of bulimia and am the heaviest weight I have been, which I am praying is just from the water retention (I have overshot by quite a bit). My question is, how long shall I not do exercise and if I were to take up something like hot yoga would that still classify as exercise and affect my recovery? I would love anyone to share their own bulimia recovery month by month (I know everyone is different) but I feel like it would give me hope or things to work towards as right now I feel quite unsexy (which I presume will only get worse once I stop exercising!). Would it be safe to start exercising say by the end of February? How do you know when its ok to start again, especially when you have already over shot your weight. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!ps ideally looking for those who have had a bulimia history because I think I will be able to relate more to it, I hope that is ok to say :)",_admin_moderator,"Mon,11/05/2018-6:45pm",Welcome to the forums,"Dear butterfly145, Your post has been slightly edited to adhere to the community guidelines.

177,alwaysthinking,04/30/2019,Messed up,"I'm new to this so I don't know what maybe a normal format for a post. I am hoping to get some support because there are no support groups near me that fit my needs. One of them is so cliquey that I don't feel like I fit in there which is not helpful in the eating disorder world.
Anyway right now I'm struggling. I've been dealing with the eating disorder for 2 years even though I've had Tendencies toward them 4 most of my life. It's directly caused from abuse in my family because my father literally told me how many calories to consume while abusing me. Prior to that he decided to mind control me by telling me if I started eating I wasn't allowed to stop or I'd be punished. I've come to realize that it didn't matter what I did I would be punished for it. This is just really hard right now because I blocked out the abuse for  30 years. I'm just now starting to know what happened and it's not easy to cope with all of this. I thought I had been doing better and my friends and other support people indicated that they thought I was making tremendous progress. I feel now though this past month all I've done is backslide because I'm either eating all the wrong foods and entirely too much of them in order to numb my hurt feelings or I am hardly eating anything at all. Today has been the worst with three flashbacks in the morning and I'm wondering if my visiting my mother in the nursing home has precipitated the re-emergence of the anorexic tendencies. Another thing with which I've been dealing is after my first inpatient stay I gained weight which probably was necessary even though I  was not thrilled with it. I was just beginning to get used to that weight and recently I've gained incredibly too much in too short of a Time because of being on a medication a couple of times. So now I'm freaking out and feeling out of control. I restricted today and decided that I needed to eat supper even though nothing appealed. I finally ate what most people in the non eating disorder world will call a light lunch. And then I just felt totally out of control and felt like I needed to self harm or compensate for it or just be completely stupid like I feel I am. I just can't understand what I'm doing wrong. It always feels like I'm doing something wrong. If anyone can commiserate or have any helpful advice feel free to respond.

178,tryingtobebrave,04/22/2019,"Overwhelmed, obsessive thoughts can’t sleep ","I’m really not happy or proud of myself for this but I’ve been having more episodes of binging and purging. I don’t know if I’m numbing my grief or what. I go from feeling stable / numb to feeling sad and angry and that’s when I get impulsive and binge/ purge. I also am confused why my psychiatrist increased my antidepressant as yes my depression was worse but don’t I need to go through that to get over my grief?? I just want to feel it so I can not have to feel it anymore but that’s not the way it’s working out, and the sadness / anger is so overwhelming and sudden that I end up using behaviors anyway. I see my trauma therapist tomorrow then dietician and ED therapist Thursday. Also my cardiologist Wednesday who I will have to disclose that I’ve been binge / purging to as I’ve been having a lot of edema and he should probably know about it for my heart issues anyway. I’m embarrassed to have to say I’m using behaviors as I’ve not been exercising and am slightly overweight so why would he believe I have an ED when my weight is what it is. Also my mom ha started commenting that I don’t eat enough which affects my IBS but I eat my meal plan??? Yes I eat a liquid meal at lunch but because of my jaw issue which has been the case for months and she knows that. I guess I haven’t been eating my snack but I don’t think it’s a big deal?? Am in denial or something but I don’t think it’s hat bad. I just need to get the binge/ purging under control because I don’t want to go back to that. I want to stay in recovery. I wore a skirt today for the first time in years and I struggled with body image but I didn’t let the eating disorder shame me out of not wearing it. I made a step forward.
The thing that’s keeping me awake is my mom said she felt like she pulled a muscle in her chest the last couple days, my dad freaked and asked if she’s sure she wasn’t having a heart attack. She said no she’s had no heart issues and knows her body and that’s not what it is. But now I’m having obsessive thoughts that I’m going to wake up tomorrow and she will have had a heart attack in the night. I know it’s probably grief making this happen as the first thought that entered my mind was “I cannot lose her too, it will break me for good”. Anyway I’m sorry this was long, I needed to get it out so hopefully I can get some sleep.

179,stewig,04/19/2019,Starting recovery,"Hello! I'm new here (literally just made an account 5 minutes ago) and honestly I don't know where to start with this.
I've had bulimia for 3 years now and I just accepted that it was a problem maybe 4 months ago. I always thought it was nothing, I just made myself sick sometimes. I thought I was insulting people with actually eating disorders to say what I'm going through was an eating disorder. But if you do it 4 times a day till you feel sick, if you sneak out of parties to use symptoms, if you suggest to hang out in restaurant that you know has a bathroom with a single toilet so you can be free to use symptoms after without the fear of someone coming in and overhearing it. Then I guess that's a big indication that yeah its a problem.
And I'm so scared? to tell someone? last time I tried telling my friend about it she told me that there's something wrong with me and then avoided me until I told her it wasn't a big deal and i did it only a few times because I was too full.
It sucks because I don't know why I'm doing it and its so hard to stop. I know its not going to make me any thinner and I know it's not good for me but I just can't stop. I don't even binge, I eat once/twice a day with barely any snacking and I still purge. It's so hard I tried to stop purging once and i broke down crying because my stomach felt so uncomfortable and I felt like a failure.
I don't know what to do, I don't know how to tell my parents they're going to be so disappointed at me. I'm attending Uni literally a 26 hour plane ride away from them. they're going to be so worried I don't want to cause them any stress.
I know this is the maintaining recovery forum but i don't know where else to post this. I've been feeling so down and stressed about myself today, finals isn't helping either. I feel disgusting and drained and I just don't know what to do to make it all better. I thought I could stop it by myself, just by pure willpower you know? but that's dumb, that's really dumb of course I cant.

180,[email protected],04/11/2019,I need suppory,"Hi,I am really struggling at the moment. I experienced the worst of my eating disorder when I was 17, when I first experienced my symptoms. It was caught early and I was diagnosed and began treatment when I was also 17. My first experience of recovery was positive, I actually enjoyed learning all of the food I could eat without feeling shame or worrying about my weight. However, I always made sure I was eating the same or less than my mum. She was like my guideline and it became my new rule that if I ate less than her, it wouldn't matter what I ate. It turned more into OCD, which I have also suffered with since I was 7. I have since completed my a levels, and am at university. I wouldn't say I have relapsed, but I am always trying to find ways to restrict, or find food groups to cut out due to 'health reasons'.. The problem is, I'm not exactly restricting, as I am still eating, however I still feel as though I am restricting because I'm never eating what I would consider 'normal food' but instead eating faddy foods. This means that I binge on foods that I do 'allow' myself, leading to me eating a lot of what I feel confident and justified wanting, which isn't always what I want to be eating. I'm following a vegan diet at the moment, but I'll have something else rather than just having what I want. I end up eating way more of the bad stuff than the more nutritious stuff. I also drink a lot of my calories, and feel as though I'm being restricted if I can't have a hot drink. Is this normal? Is there a way I can stop feeling like I'm restricting even when I'm not restricting? How can I stop comparing everything I eat to my mum?
Also I have no energy, everything seems like such a big effort. Will this stop if I gain more weight?

182,thrynistrying,04/10/2019,struggling with EDs after weightloss,"alrighty, so this is my first post on any kind of website like this, so I'll start with a little bit about myself. (TW- binge eating, orthorexia, anorexia, sexual assault)
I am an 18-year-old full-time college student getting my degree in psychology and nutrition. I grew up overweight, homeschooled, no siblings, I was a loner due to circumstance. I began college in spring 2017 and was bombarded with the reality of who I was physically compared to my peers. I was obese. halfway through age 16, after suffering for so many years hating my body in my childhood, I finally took hold of my weight problem that was caused by a trash diet and no psychical activity. for the first few months of the weight loss, I cut out junk food and began drinking a lot of water and eating more ""healthy"" food.
 in August of 2017, it was the first week of my fall semester, I had lost a significant amount of weight, I had CONFIDENCE for the genuine FIRST TIME in my entire life. unfortunately, life working in the shitty ways it does, put a bad person in my path and I was thus sexually assaulted at the end of that week. I was 16 and he was 21. I was lucky enough to have supportive parents and my best friend, all of which gave me the guidance and space I needed to heal. I did attempt to press charges, and I fought for 7 months to get my case even acknowledged. I was put on blast publicly on his popular youtube channel (which has now grown tremendously and is my worst nightmare), yet the police shut down my case in February of 2018 because ""there wasn't enough evidence."" wasn't enough evidence- even though the entire hour and a half long event was RECORDED, and then the assailant himself put out a ""storytime"" youtube video shaming ME.  irrelevant. now, during that fall semester, I had to stay active in my classes and in my college (which he attended), but the day the semester ended I was already packed up and ready to move 3 hours north to a new college and new home with my family. in spring 2018 I began at my new college, new life, new name, new body. my weight loss during those 7 months of fighting for my case was not too faltered. I continued my diet and began further restriction; I have fears of many many ingredients now. it took me a year after beginning my weight loss to lose the weight, and I've maintained that loss now for the last year. sounds like I did pretty well, looks like it too, but inside has been an absolute warzone for the last few months. after hitting my lowest weight last summer, I was in my stride, but as some of you may know, having a restricted diet can lead to developing binge eating, which is what has taken over my last half a year. I've gotten myself into a binge/starve cycle that is destroying my quality of life. I will ""binge"", sometimes in one sitting and sometimes for days. I know the word binge means different things for different people, however, to make up for those binges, I'll restrict and eat only ""healthy"". I cannot seem to stop doing this. it keeps happening. like as I'm typing right now, I'm thinking about what bad shit I want to eat even though I'm ""skinny"" right now because it's been a few days since I had a bad binge.
I want to elaborate on how extreme this is for me. I haven't eaten normally in almost a year, I'm either eating too much or too little. I KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT, once again I STUDY NUTRITION AND PSYCHOLOGY so I am VERY AWARE of what I'm doing to myself, and I KNOW how to stop it, but I CANT? I don't want to? I just don't know what my excuse is. it was right around the 1-year mark of my assault that my mental/emotional/physical/spiritual states turned extremely dark again. I've begun smoking since turning 18 this last October, it's a good oral fixation to avoid eating. I will starve, or eat very very little, very nutrient packed healthy food, and then binge on nasty food out of nowhere just as I get skinny again. by skinny, here's what I mean. with my weight loss and loose skin, I have horrible body dysmorphia. I can describe it like a phantom limb. when someone loses their arm, they still feel it, they still see it, they still identify with it, because the brain hasn't caught up to the body. I still feel fat, I still see fat, I still identify as fat. when I binge, it makes me retain water and of course whatever food is in me, so my weight increases. (i weigh myself religiously). on rare occasions, I do break the cycle for a week or two, and get myself down to a lower weight. this fluctuation on the scale is something I can feel psychically and see.
look, I know I've got issues, we all do, that's why we're here. I have been in counseling a few times in my life for other reasons, like the PTSD surrounding the assault, but I haven't gotten help for my definite ED. the lovely therapist I had in the months following my assault noticed I was at risk of developing an eating disorder, and now here I am over a year later and some of them are killing me slowly. I know what I'm doing, this weird yo-yo diet I'm putting my body through, of having to process nasty toxic food and then small amounts of ultra-healthy food on and off just aren't how someone should live.
see, as I say all of this here, if any soul has taken the time to listen to me, I hear the EDs both going off at once. one is telling me to binge, eat everything, another voice is telling me to starve because I haven't eaten yet today so why mess it all up--- with both of these voices going off, I, of course, have the one quiet, oh so quiet, rational voice. the voice I know is me. the one that is so shoved down and silenced inside of myself because so many different disorders want the spotlight in my life. my rational voice is telling me, yes it is true I haven't eaten, and it's true I shouldn't binge, and yes I should eat soon, and if I want bread what's stopping me- SILENCED- that voice just got silenced as I was typing from it because starving voice said what's stopping me is the scale. but, as that one says that, the binge brain is still just telling me that is what I should do. I am hungry, if I don't eat soon I won't eat at all, but if I do eat soon I might just keep eating all day, I don't know, I sort of know, and that's what has me scared- knowing that I don't know. am I crazy? I don't think so. I think I'm more normal than I know, but if I think that then do I really know? I don't know. Help. This is the end of my first post, I may end up making future ones, this may end up being very helpful for me, only time will tell. I know I will have to overcome this, no matter what situation I'm in, there's always a silver lining visible to me. I knew that I would come out of the assault as a different person, my life would be and has been forever changed. for the better? I can't say. I just want this shitty chapter of my life to close positively as the past shitty chapters have.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,04/11/2019-1:19pm",Hi thrynistrying and welcome,"Hi thrynistrying and welcome to the forums!

186,LastOneFastOne,03/29/2019,Fully Weight Restored - Metabolism still sluggish?,"HI all - I'm new to the forums, so it's nice to meet you all!I'm 23 and up until recently I've been a long-distance swimmer for the majority of my life. I swam through college and officially retired from the sport last year when I finished out my senior season and graduated. I struggled after freshman year and lost a significant amount of weight before my sophomore year which gradually continued through my junior year. Finally, I hit a point where I realized there was no way I could keep up with the amount of hours a day I was swimming while consistently underfueling like I was. I was threatened to be removed from the team temporarily on medical leave, but I was also named captain for my senior season. So that was my turning point for me. I was ready to embrace my final season whole-heartedly at my best and also put my best foot forward as an example to the younger girls on my team of living a healthy lifestyle.So I've gradually recovered since then. My senior year and final season, I was still not exactly where I should've been but gradually on the rise. My weight alone was never an easy metric to track, as being a swimmer, I've always had to maintain a fair amount of muscle. It was my body fat percentage that drastically needed the improvement, as I had been working with our athletic trainers.Long story short: I retired from my final season (and closed out with personal bests in all of my events if you want a happy ending! :D) and have entered the workforce as a normal person. About 4 months ago, I finally got my period back after about 2.5 years. Here's the tricky part and I would love if someone could weigh in.I'm fully weight restored in a healthy range, but a little over what I consider close for comfort. Since my period has started, my hormones have definitely been completely wild (it's like being a teenager all over again with random acne). I've definitely gotten curvier (which I love, because I'm used to being a broad-shouldered swimmer lol - now I'm more feminine!) but I'll admit lately I've been trying to stall the weight gain with old habits. I'm trying to get a grasp on normal life with light activity around work, not my typical high intensity training. I just want to maintain at this point (and have some of the fat on my belly redistribute) but it feels like my metabolism is still wonky. My hands are still freezing, I'm still having dramatic GI distress (excessive bloating, constipation, acid reflux), my vitals are all still much lower than average, my adrenals ramp up out of nowhere. I've been much happier and healthier feeling, but I'm concerned that if I continue this ""normal, balanced diet"" I will only continue to gain and I am a healthy limit where I don't need to gain anymore weight. It's really tempting to fall back into old habits and I'm worried that maybe these attempt have stalled my metabolism.Would love if anyone can weigh in or lend insight here - has anyone experienced this and can give me advice? Is this normal in weight-restoration? Does it ever get better / regulate itself? Is it just because my hormones are still going all over the place? I just want to maintain without thinking or worrying and getting all systems going again like normal! Will it work itself out? I'm concerned I'm just going to continue to gain.So sorry that this was so long - really appreciate anyone who actually read through the whole novel! :)",_admin_moderator,"Fri,03/29/2019-12:27pm",Post Edited,"Hi LastOneFastOne, We are glad to hear that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

189,OLLAY,03/20/2019,Amenorrhea 4 years so far,"Hello everyone! I am new to this forum, so I will just give a little info about myself. I am 36 years old, but my battle with anorexia began at 20 years old. In short, I made a full recovery when I was 22 years old, regaining my weight and health, as well as my period. In 2014, I fell back into old habits to cope with new stress, and I relapsed back into anorexia. I lost a dangerous amount of weight, and I also lost my period again. Over the course of 2018 until now, I have gained back some much-needed weight. My body composition isn't the best, as I gained weight by eating whatever and whenever I wanted. But I have not had a period since 2014. I have had blood tests done recently, and my hormone levels tested as normal. But being that I am 36 years old, and I still do not have a period, I am a little worried. Is this normal or something I should be concerned about? Anyone else in the same boat?

190,chickadee,03/19/2019,(22 F) am i subconsciously keeping my old habits??,"I developed anorexia when I was about 14, and after going through extensive therapy, I've considered myself to be in recovery for the past 3 years. However, while I haven't had thoughts of restriction or made any conscious effort to keep my weight down, I'm finding that even with the addition of certain foods, my weight has been very low. It's above my weight when I was sick, but nowhere near where I feel I should be for my height. I think the thing that's really holding me back is my inability to eat large portions of food. Where I am right now, I can't manage much more than a child's size portion of almost anything. When I eat to over-fullness, I get extremely uncomfortable and nauseated. I've been told it's a mental block, and I've also been told my stomach has shrunk. I'm concerned my tiny portions are sabotaging my effort to get better.

192,Beccabb39,03/19/2019,Recovery and parotid swelling and stones,"I have been in recovery for 3 years and am proud and the point I stand now, a healthy body weight, strength and more mental stability than ever in the past but I still have circumstances and emotional battles that make some days or weeks harder than others and find myself falling back into bumemic behavuours. My faith and family and spouse have been my saving grace and as my faith continues to grow so does my love for myself.
I am a devote athlete and began gymnastics at 7, which within 5 years develope anorexia. It's been a lifetime of ups and down, but now as I reach 40 have a different appreciation for life and know how valuable my life is.My question is through the years of purging I have developed so I've been told an autoimmune disorder which I belief is brought on by the ED, the swelling of my parotids is so severe and does not only happen in purging boughts, but when healthy eating behaviors are occurring, it's become extremely painful and relentless. Dr have advised me to go through lots of testing and possibly that I have salivary stones. I have been successful with the advice to aliviate swelling and pain with medications and hot compress and LOTS of sour candy but this too is no longer having much affect and causing distress. I find soup for weeks and lots of acid help resolve pain and swelling but the moment I indroduce anything which has sodium or requires intense chewing I flare....ANY suggestions or help with this are welcomed and appreciated.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,03/20/2019-2:29pm","Dear Beccabb39, we are glad","Dear Beccabb39, we are glad you reached out!

193,setapartforjesus,03/08/2019,Can anyone relate to this?,"Hi everyone, I'm new here. After following Jesus for a few months I felt moved to lay down my pride yesterday, and what I realized is that the eating disorders of my teen years that I thought I was ""over"" are very much still a part of me, only secretly.What I mean by that is I no longer intentionally restrict my food intake or binge or purge in order to achieve a certain size. But I don't exactly make eating full meals a priority either.For example, if I am sleepy and hungry at the same time, I choose sleep over cooking every time. I just don't have the motivation to cook food.And whenever I'm really hungry and involved in an activity that I really like, I only eat the minimal amount I need to in order to get rid of the hunger pangs, and then I go back to what I'm doing.Food is more like an inconvenience rather than a source of joy and nourishment, but I don't exactly hate food either.But somehow I've been able to maintain a normal weight and BMI. Because I'm a kidney donor I see doctors routinely but no one is concerned. The only reason why I even considered there must be a problem is because I get migraines and get sick routinely.Does anybody else have a similar relationship to food?I'm committed to recovery and I've contacted NEDA and they are working to find me faith-based counselors, programs, and dietitians. I'm thinking a big first step would be to get a simple meal-plan designed for me that I can stick to and follow. If anyone out there who has been where I am has any advice about my next steps I'd greatly appreciate hearing it.SetapartforJesus",_admin_moderator,"Tue,03/19/2019-7:12pm","Hi HaianhJumi,  Your post has","Hi HaianhJumi,  Your post has been edited slightly, as it contained comments that may not be helpful, or may trigger other users.

195,Lister,03/10/2019,"[46 yr. old, M] In recovery from bulimia for four years and still experiencing digestive issues and trouble getting to a healthy","I became bulimic at the age of thirteen. I was a chubby, but not obese kid, and purged for over thirty years, through all of my teen years, and my twenties. By the time I hit thirty though, it started to work in reverse, and I gained a significant amount of weight, no matter how much I purged.
Four years ago, I made the decision to stop. I saw myself through recovery, which was tough, and I lost most of my excess weight slowly through diet and exercise. I continue to exercise daily, and eat healthily. I drink plenty of water and eat more fruits and vegetables now than I ever have in my life. However, I seemed to have hit a plateau on my weight loss, and I think it might have something to do with my digestive system not working properly. For three decades, I have kept my digestive system from functioning properly, and four years later after giving up purging, I am still experiencing intestinal distress, severe bloating and distention of my abdomen, and constipation.
Has anyone in recovery experienced this? What have you done to make your body function healthily again? Were you ever able to lose weight in a healthy manner after you stopped binging and purging? I feel healthy, and much better now that I have left the bulimia behind me, but the body issues still remain, and so do the digestive issues. I see a gastroenterologist at the end of the month to discuss this. Are there any specific questions that I should ask them? Will my body ever forgive me for what I have done to it, and go back to some state of normalcy? I’m very depressed about this, and I’m terrified that I will never get back to a healthy weight.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,03/13/2019-1:05pm","Hi Lister, and welcome to the","Hi Lister, and welcome to the forums!

206,thistooshallpass,01/25/2019,This is It,"I've been bulimic since I was 13. I'm now 30 years old and have just completed 8 days in recovery. I feel like this is it..I can really do it this time.  I've been on anti-anxiety medication since I was 19, and was recently diagnosed with depression and OCD. Bulimia is linked directly to my anxiety.I just now ate a certain kind of food and stopped when I was full, not when it was gone. I don't think I've ever in my life not finished the food in front of me. Now, as I sit on the couch folding laundry and listening to Netflix in the background, my whole body seems to vibrate with the knowledge that there is still that certain kind of food in the fridge. A warm hug of need and want. I know how this goes...I know where this path leads. It doesn't stop there. After I eat the certain kind of food, there would be a furious scavenge through the kitchen for more. Fast forward an hour from now, I'll be back on the couch folding laundry, but this time shaking and weak from purging. Yet, the certain kind of food is still in the fridge.

Like today, my phone battery started having problems and I need to get it replaced this weekend, it’s under warranty, shouldn’t be a big deal, but it’s making me feel so stressed out my body physically can’t relax. I’ve always had this problem and it makes me feel worthless, like maybe I don’t deserve to eat. Or that restricting is the only way to make me feel better/ in control. I know these thoughts are irrational. And I made myself eat today, no matter how much I didn’t want to. I know I need to be vigilant right now with my thoughts with all the increase in ED thoughts lately.

208,iwanttolive,01/22/2019,Hurting so much,"Hi.  I am hurting so much.  I am dealing with a new diagnosis, something I have been searching for, a reason for my physical pain.  I now have answers.  It also is a reason I have anxiety, sleeplessness, and depression.  Pain throughout my body.  Dizziness and headaches.  All of these now have a reason.  But the more difficult thing or equally as difficult is my emotional pain.  Being so misunderstood by family members.  Mistreated by the one I live with. I have been doing pretty well with the eating, some stress eating but not binging.  I stay up way late and then am over tired come morning.  Work makes my pain worse but I have to work to keep my Medicaid.  My emotion comes out as anger.  Anger at not being able to live in my own house without constant turmoil.  And anger from my Mom when she gets frustrated with me for not agreeing with everything she says.  She gets angry and yells at me.  We are fine until I don't agree with her.  Then she starts raising her voice and then I am wrong because I don't agree with what she is saying.  I am just so ready to move, but I can't.  My therapist wants me to.  An example of my sister.  She tells me we ""promised"" each other that we wouldn't go to bed angry with each other.  She said I have broken that promise as I have not spoken to her about when we have a fight.  I told her that I was not comfortable with talking with her as I feel she is mean to me and we get no where.  She said I broke our promise.  Later the next day I called her, left a message and said we agreed to see my therapist when you were feeling better. I came home and she said yes she got my message, after I asked her.  She said she was not going back to my therapist because she didn't like her. I then told her you are breaking your promise.  She said she would not see her.  Today she explained it wasn't that she didn't like her, she didn't like her approach. I asked her to explain.  She said she didn't like it when I started screaming at her in the office, my therapist did not tell me to stop screaming. I told my sister I didn't scream at her. She said all the people in the other rooms could here you you were screaming so loud.  And she said she didn't like that my therapist said it was okay for me to talk with my parent's when we had a problem.  My sister just wants it to be us but that doesn't work.  She keeps bringing up how I walk away when I don't like what is being said and I say I don't want to talk about it.  She doesn't realize she does this and shuts me down all the time.  I did do this a few times many months ago.  She has been in her room and hasn't said things that trigger my PTSD as she did when I walked away from her and I talked to her about why I did what I did.  She doesn't remember this though.  She told me she would see another therapist but not mine.  So I called one and am waiting for the call back, although my sister told me she would not go on an ongoing basis, she would go once or twice.  I said that isn't going to work. We need to go until the therapist thinks we are able to work things out on our own.  She repeated she wouldn't go for more than one or two times.  I said you are not keeping your commitment, to go to therapy with me.  My therapist told me today that I did not scream at my sister.  So I am desperate.  I am lonely.  Angry.  Sad.Thank you for listening.iwanttolive  ps  I am safe",_admin_moderator,"Wed,01/23/2019-10:03am",Thank you for sharing,"Hi iwanttolive, We're sorry that you are feeling so alone and hopeless right now!

210,silent.rain,01/10/2019,From anorexia to binging,"Hello! This is my first topic. Briefly, I suffered from anorexia for almost 2 years and have been in recovery since January 2018. I restricted on almost every foss and went from a certain amount of weight (I have nevee been obese) to a certain amount of weight and entered a hospital. Unfortunately, I did not receive an adequate treatment and I started my recovery at home, alone, with the help of my family (I am 17 years old). Today, I exercise very frequently and want to be fit and healthy but  I also have started binging very frequently for the past month. It starts like a normal eating but I end up binging on a variety of different foods. I eat enormous quantities of the thinfs I have been restricting for almost 2 years. I started gaining weight, of course, and lost all of the self-confidence that I had obtained during recovery. I try to stop but I can not. After binging I feel very embarrassed and of course have stomach aches but they do not stop me from doing exactly the same thing on the next day. Have you experienced that, anorexia fighters? How can I cope with it?

211,tryingtobebrave,01/15/2019,What is wrong with me???,"I’ve noticed somewhat recently that I start to feel comforted in the fact that though I’m choosing recovery now, that if life gets too much, another trauma occurs, or my depression doesn’t improve, I can always fall back into the eating disorder.
What is wrong with me??? Why would I think that, when I’ve worked so hard for the past six months at recovery, after I’ve gotten back on track after having more slips recently. I hate the eating disorder and what it did to me and the toll it took on so many aspects of my life. Why am I thinking about being comforted by it always being an option then???I’ve also been having a huge internal conflict that I finally understand better but is still hard to accept. I thought that by allowing myself to have a relationship with my father after he worked hard for the last five years to show he’s no longer abusive, accepting help for his mental illness, meds and using what he’s learned in therapy, by accepting that he’s changed and allowing a relationship meant that I was betraying myself in a way and saying that all the horrible things that happened is now okay. Logically, that’s not the truth, nor does he think that. He continues to take responsibility for his actions. But it’s caused an internal crisis. It’s not that I think forgiving him makes me weak. And he’s the only person in my family who has been supportive through my ED recovery.
I think the issue is that for the last five years, I’ve struggled with identity issues but one that I always defined myself as was someone who survived 21 years of abuse and was stronger for it, who was closed off to my family and better off without them. Now, my dad having to appear to have truly changed, almost angers me, not really at him, but just that the way I defined myself no longer applies. That by letting the person who caused the events that hardened my heart support me and have a relationship, I’m somehow too soft or weak and I honestly have no idea who I am without that part of my identity. Yet as I’ve said, his behavior has truly changed once he got help for his mental illness after I stood up to him five years ago, and his support seems genuine. I’m just really confused about all of this and would appreciate any input or insight you guys might have.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,01/17/2019-8:22pm",Resources ,"Hi, tryingtobebrave and savedbygrace.

213,chunkymonkey68,01/16/2019,Seasonal Apathy,"I've been feeling extra anxious lately with the windy, wet, intimidating weather currently been experiencing for the last month, or so...I find myself eating more than i should on the days i am not scheduled to work. Furthermore, after binging and purging i lull myself to sleep. Out of anxiety last night, I purged.Ironically this old feeling of apathy over food coming back up, after a food frenzy,  reminded me of my ""Old School"" days back in HS, college and even grad school too. I have been eating healthy but then there are these periods of days when I stuff on certain food and these are the days in which I also become kind of apathetic to my oral hygiene. I feel embarrassed to even see my dentist, whom currently I don't have 1 on standby...I feel embarrassed that after 1 look at my teeth they will be able to assess my eating and habits.With just 1 look into my mouth, and a few good inquisitive questions,  and the dentist,  or hygienist,   will know about my dental apathy from both my EdI see a shrink about every 3 months but he never seems to look at my teeth. He sits behind a desk and goes over a list of similar questions about my meds, and level of functioning which I am feeling every 3 months.I wish my shrink knew me as well as my ex-BF or BFF's. I miss my inner circle of friends from college.I love working as it keeps me so busy that I hardly have time to eat certain foods or to act apathetic. I feel a part of my local community at my mall job. I floss my teeth before I leave for my mall job. Considering how i feel sometimes, it seems like work keeps me functioning at a higher level mentally. I feel like Wonder Woman at work,   and on my days off,   like the lazy version of Louis Lane,  the average secretariat,  before her antidepressant kicks in,   and she is able to save the world,   once over,    again, and again...each and every time she ends up looking like a real hero...  OMG, I think I need to increase my exercise,  and see if that's what I really need to do to activate my motivation to improve my overall health and re-dress my current, intermittent feeling of apathy... I'm sure I don't need an additional psych med for this problem. This is an elbow to mouth, and lack of motivation problem that I must work on.Will i ever be able to meet the ""Love"" of my life and marry and have a ""Normal Life?""This seems like a Total mystery to me.

My current diagnosis is BED, though for most of my life I’ve been bulimic. I’ve been abstinent from purging for six years until last night, when the increased ED noise from treatment got unbearable and I tried to purge again.  Without going into details, it was unsatisfying and didn’t work like it used to to get my anger out. I made it back to treatment today and was honest about my behavior, but I’m really feeling a confusing mix of grief (that my old standby behaviors aren’t successfully stuffing feelings), hope (that it’s probably a sign of health that I’m not successfully stuffing feelings), and relief (that my lack of success limits my desires to get into a behavior cycle). I’m also having to resist the urge to escalate by using purging aids. Does anyone have experience to share on what’s helped you to see past the loss of familiar behaviors to life worth living?

I am considering going back to school but am sort of terrified like what if that is a mistake and i fail and well end up like i did last time i went to school with well no new job and a lot of debt which well thank god my parents help pay for school. if i go back its all on me money wise its a big decision and i just don't know. I also quit my boxing club because after i was not allowed to exercise i just couldn't motivate myself to go back now i sort of regret it but if i go back to school i would have no time to go to classes. i might just join a cheaper gym that could work on my schedule even if i don't go back to school i think my own schedule might just be easier than going to classes i can be my own boss but i don't really want to get out of control either but i think working out in a healthy way could be good to but my boxing gym was very expensive and missing it would make me feel guilty as it cost so much... i need to make changes to myself to me my life and well just all of it my therapist told me she doesn't want me to be a statistic and well she is right she said my friends and family just want me to be happy and healthy.

221,likewater,12/13/2018,Sexual development in teenage after eating disorder,"Hi. I'm a college freshman girl who recently turned 18. I suffered from a restrictive eating disorder since I was 14, lost my period for one-ish years and got it back. After that, I managed to gain weight, but I kind of switched to other symptoms like eating and purging. I'm not completely symptom free, but now the interval of purging has increased a lot and I personally believe that I gained enough weight. (Upper half in the normal weight BMI scale) However, I somehow feel like my body and mind isn't developing sexually. Parts of my body started developing, however, not as much as compared to my friends. Also, I don't feel anything sexual. I haven't fell in love before and I never have loved anyone in terms of 'wanting to date'. Do you think this is normal and that I should give it some more time? Or should I go see a doctor or a professional and ask them what might be going on?",_admin_moderator,"Fri,12/14/2018-12:02pm",Resources,"Hi, savedbygrace.

222,tryingtobebrave,12/28/2018,Rough day ,"I had a pretty tough day today. One of my biggest trauma triggers happened, my therapist calls it a capital “T” trauma, meaning for me those are the memories in which I thought / was about to die. These don’t happen often for me, but when they do they’re completely incapacitating. Can’t move, can’t speak. I canceled plans with a friend, curled up shaking in a ball in my bed. This is actually an improvement, as I used to hide in the closet when this happened. I thought about using restriction all day, but I got my meal plan in and only restricted a bit. I’m not beating myself up over it because it’s still an improvement. I used healthy skills, mainly distraction, instead of harmful ways to cope. I ended up having to take my medication; my psychiatrist prescribed a heavier dose for me. It gets me back to reality and the present without adrenaline pumping through my system. I slept a lot after that. I’m going to bed now even though it’s only 6:40.

225,iwanttolive,12/25/2018,so difficult,"It is so difficult living with people.  Especially judgmental and critical people.  I bought a house gift for the three or us.  Our cabinets are messy with a bunch of mismatched containers for food.  I bought a very nice 38 piece set of containers and my roommate was cold and saying I use all of those in there, you aren't thinking of throwing them all out?  And you will have to organize all the other containers and sort through them because I certainly am not going to.  I was so hurt.  I think angry too if I were to be honest.  Always being criticized and underhandedly too, and then when my sister and I talk, she always has to challenge everything I say and questions everything, and wonders why I get upset.   Just a bit of a let down after a really nice day.  But I get to choose here.  I can let it ruin my mood, or not.  I am going to choose to not let it ruin my mood.  I am in control of that.  I don't need food to numb out or restricting to numb out or self harm.  I am beyond these ways of coping with rejection. That is how I see it.  Rejection.  When together with family, I am never heard. I try to talk and no one hears me.  Feeling judge and criticized all the time is a tough way to live.  But I have friends that love me and accept me and aren't critical of me.  And most of all, my faith in Jesus and knowing that He is enough.  I don't need anything more.  That is how I have been trying to live my life.  One can take anything away from me, even through me in prison, but the one thing that can't be taken away from me is Jesus.  So I am going to rest with that thought, organize the cabinet sometime tomorrow or the next day and give my roommate all the containers that are old.  I hope you all have a good night.  Thank you for listening.  Remember.  The only one we can control, on a good day, is ourselves.   The way we react to situations, people, events.  That is up to us.  We can not control other people, how they react to us, or treat us.  We decide how we react to what is going on.

Just to comment on wasting another year, God says He uses all things for good for those that love Him and are called according to His purpose.  God doesn't waste anything.  I am sure you learned a lot this year and have grown.  You may still be struggling with symptoms but you are not where you were a year ago.  You are sharing here to others on the forum and supporting others, you are helping with your sisters, you just graduated from college.  These are huge.  You are working on being honest with your team, by the way, how did it go with the doctor?  I think it is you who was going to the cardiologist?   Sometimes I get people mixed up, sorry if I did.  The only time things are a waste is when we give up and stop trying.  Taking a break is okay and sometimes needed.  But that is different than giving up and the last time I knew, you haven't given up.  You are indeed a recovery warrior.  You are flexing that recovery muscle.   Think of that when you can't physically exercise.  Exercise spiritually as well.  That is where this war is to be fought.  With prayer.  With God's help.  Don't beat yourself up.  Try to be kind to yourself. Accept yourself for who you are.  You are special and have something unique to offer this world.

229,alexaowens35,12/17/2018,no one to talk to,"Hi everyone. This is my first post, and I'm desperate to have a connection with someone anyone who has any idea what I'm going though so I don't feel so alone. Here it goes... Although I've had body image issues my entire life my ED really came out the summer between my senior year of high school and freshman year of college. During the summer, I lost weight organically working out and eating very little. I thought i was happy and still thought I could lose a little more. My goal weight kept shifting lower. Thus, when I got to college and pressures for school and social life began to kick in, I turned to bulimia to satisfy my need to for food and my desire to be thin and keep up appearances. I binged and purged almost every day beginning in October until Decemeber when I was caught by my family who had noticed the change in my eating habits. This is where my problem begins. My mother is a worrier and a punisher. Her knee jerk reaction was to pull me out of school, cancel my spring break plans, etc. Essentially put my entire life on stop. I did not want this. I was finally making friends at school? I was happy, I could not stay in my mundane hometown. So, I lied. I said I was better than I actually was and promised to seek therapy once back at school for the winter semester. I did. And I did get better. I was no longer binging and purging everyday, but I was still unhappy with who I was and partaking in unhealthy eating patterns (skipping meals, overexercising, etc.). I felt like this is what I had to do to stay ""pretty"" — what I convinced myself I was for the first time when I had lost the weight. When I returned home for the summer, I had done my part convincing them that I was healthy and no moments of relapse or negative thinking assciated with my weight, I still feel as though there has been a shift in our relationship. I am afraid of being honest with them because I know that if I show any signs of slipping up, they will take away the life I have worked so hard to build while away at college. This mistrust sowed combined with the natural growing pains associated with coming home from college have put a strain on my parents and my relationship. I hate coming home. I feel like I am walking on eggshells, waiting to be caught for something and have my world taken away. I hate being at home. I was not popular in high school and have virtually no friends at home. My worst nightmare is being stuck here again. I feel like my world slows down. I feel depressed not only because of the slowness and anxiety that encapsulates my home life, but also because I have no one (but my at-school therapist who i barely see anymore because of scheduling conflicts) to talk to about this. None of my friends know about my ED as I am too afraid that our relationship will be forever strained and changed by such a revelation. I don't think that they will look at me the same, so I have kept them in the dark. My sister is a snitch who without a doubt will give me unsolicited advice and run and tell my parents. I am just looking for someone to talk these issues out with. Please anyone. Be there for me. I'll listen to anyone'sissues",_admin_moderator,"Thu,12/20/2018-1:18pm",Hello and welcome to the,Hello and welcome to the forums alexaowens35!

230,tryingtobebrave,12/19/2018,Too much bad news ,"Horrible things have happened with my two best friends. One of whom, her mother just died. I asked her if she needed space or rather I keep checking in with her. She asked me to keep in contact often, and I have been. The funeral is tomorrow (I’m not able to attend) , and I’ll see her on Friday. I feel awful for not asking if she would like my to attend, but I have two therapy appointments and one with my dietician tomorrow. It’s a balancing act with supporting her and keeping myself healthy. I really want to step up for her because she did for my when I was in treatment, even came to family night when I was in PHP to learn how to support me.
My other best friend was just diagnosed with Parkinson’s and doesn’t want to take the medication which is the only thing that would slow down the progression, and in his case, it will happen a lot faster without it. I can’t stand the thought of watching my best friend waste away. But I can’t force him to follow through with the treatment.
All of these things hit me tonight, and I exercised way past what my dietician and I last discussed, even on top of my already screwed up knee, I really messed it up now. I physically won’t be able to exercise even if I get the urges. I didn’t realize why I had this compulsion until I started sobbing about everything that’s happening afterwards. Again, need to stop ignoring my emotions.
I am glad I’m seeing my dietician tomorrow as i really need to talk to her about the exercise issue I keep struggling with.

231,tryingtobebrave,12/14/2018,Feeling guilty ,"I saw my dietician yesterday, and we changed my exercise contract. My eating disorder is actually louder now though, constantly there telling me to burn calories. My dietician states often enough that exercise for me is not to burn calories, but for my mental health and physical wellbeing. I learned some new skills to try to reroute those thoughts during exercising and when I bodycheck and compare my body with others. I will be putting an effort into doing these things. But a part of me misses my eating disorder. Especially with how much I struggle during winter, a part of me desperately wishes I was using behaviors to make all the feelings, thoughts and memories disappear. I am so used to having numbed out my feelings for most of my life, that anytime i experience a negative emotion it makes me feel like I’m going out of control. Which when it passes, I realize is not the case. I miss the feelings I got from my past disordered behaviors. However I will not go back down that road, as life as a whole is much better in recovery than relapse. The same always goes from my addiction, I’ve just been sober a lot longer than I’ve been in recovery from my eating disorder. My best friends mom died very suddenly yesterday, she’s only in her 30s and has now lost both her parents. My heart hurts very badly for her. I feel so angry at all the things she’s had to suffer through, it seems like it never ends. I know all I can do is to support her in whatever way she needs me to.

233,budachelle,11/19/2018,11 Years and Counting,"Hi there! I am 26 years old and have been struggling with BED for the past 11 years. I began using food as a coping mechanism during my sophomore year of highschool. During that time, I was very depressed and unhappy. I won't go much into depth on the details since it is the past. I've moved on since then. I have been on two rounds of antidepressants throughout the past 10 years as well as seen 3 therapists off and on. I have currently been off antidepressants for over 2 years nor have I seen a therapist during the course of that time. I began to fear that antidepressants would be the norm for me, but I have realized that it isn't the case. The past two years I have been handling my BED disorder quite well. I even went months without doing so last year. However, it is rearing its ugly head again. I have moved four times in the course of five years with my husband's job. Restarting over and over--adjusting okay during the course. I have realized over the past two weeks that I think I am actually depressed...not in the traditional sense of being sad. However, I lack motivation to do anything. Going to the grocery store each week has become something I dread simply because I am finding it so immensely daunting Outside of work (I am a workaholic--in a job that I don't necessarily enjoy) I can't seem to find motivation to do anything (besides run). I eat, sleep, and watch tv, and sit (thinking about things I want to do). I've decided that how I am feeling isn't normal. I am lagging...big time. Nonetheless, my episodes of binging are coming back... My husband is away for a month with work and I am worried....TERRIFIED of BED gaining control over me again. I am currently going to the doctor to get a referral for a therapist. I need support. This is why I am here. I feel alone. I feel guilty and defeated and I need hope. I will admit I don't have friends and I am exhausted from starting over.
For anyone who reads this, thank you. I just need someone....anyone to talk to. Even if that someone doesn't reply. I need to feel heard. I have no one to hold me accountable and I will be honest I don't know if I can trust myself right now. Blogging has helped me in the past. I pray that it will be helpful once again. Tomorrow WILL be a better day. I have to forgive myself and move on.

237,iwanttolive,12/07/2018,Feelings,"Feelings are so powerful.  Feeling sad, mad, happy, angry, funny, hopeful.  Most of these are tolerable, unless the happy gets a little too out of hand and one is told to be quiet, you are being to loud, or then comes the one that is really tough for me, the feeling of sad.  What to do with this one.  I used to eat.  Or starve it away.  Now, I am trying to talk, post, will talk to God, haven't yet, read, watch a movie, however the movie I watched was a sad one so that didn't help.  So when in recovery and use of behaviors is no longer an option, texting a therapist isn't an option, talking to the parent's about the situation isn't an option, as it was decided it wouldn't be regarding this particular situation anymore, and it really doesn't help any of us anyway, what does one do?  I guess the afore mentioned things.  Prayer for some of us, distraction for a while until the intensity of the feeling goes down to a more manageable level.  In DBT there are the zones.  I don't remember them but I know there is the one that is out of the window of tolerance, then inside the window of tolerance and then below the window of tolerance.  Something like that. Right now I am below, which means my mood is low, below the norm. I need to get it into the norm.  If I were angry it would be outside the window and I would need to bring it down into the level of average.  For so many decades, I used self harm, starvation and binging, none of which do I use anymore, so I need to do something.  One of the things is posting here, another is prayer, and then reading.  I also color but am too tired to do that now.  So I will end this, say a prayer and ask God for help then read.  I am thankful that I no longer use behaviors that don't work anyways, at least not in the long term.  I just needed to post as I am very sad.  Feeling alone.  Sad and lonely.  I guess they often go together.

I want to ask my sisters to tell me exactly what they think of me. What they talk about with each other about me, without me knowing. I want to know what they say about me. I know it isn't good. I know they don't really have positive things to say about me. But I want to know up font. Straight from them. Tell me who you think I am, what I do wrong and why you don't like me. What do you talk with each other about me that I only know that there are many, oh, I meant to say a few, says one of them; actually two of my sisters said that. One lives across the country and hasn't spent more than a week with the family and that was more than five years ago. She doesn't even know me or who I am yet she makes judgements about me. I know they talk about me. SO.. tell me what you say to each other. Get it out in the open. Let me know what you really think about me. I really want to send that e mail out. They say I am the sick one because I was the one who was so sick with the eating disorder. They would never admit that eating disorders are family disorders. I was the one with all the problems. I could go on and list all the problems my sisters have now. Why won't they just accept me and love me. They may say it with words, but words mean nothing without action. I have lived my life as the reject of the family. I guess I still do. Such a shame. I know who I am. Who I belong to. Whos I am. I am a child of The Most High God. He calls me His own. He says He loves me. He cherishes me. He gave His life for me. He calls me His friend. What more could a person ask for. So if my sisters don't like me, I have a great many friends and people who do.

242,chunkymonkey68,11/27/2018,Working Hard and Weight is Down ,"So I had a lot of muscle pains today and took some aspirin-caffeine pills to medicate my cramps. At the end of my work day at school, after re-arranging the chairs, and even lifting 1 to move it into place, I finally was surprised to have my period return in full force. I panicked and ran to the restroom. There I felt really anxious and a bit weak to my head. I made it home right on time before another high tide episode w/ my period occurred. I had a small portion meal for dinner and wasn't much hungry after this sudden menstrual hemorrhage. I think the mix of caffeine and aspirin plus the heavy lifting of chairs brought on a heavy menstrual flow which was due about 2.5 months ago. Oh well, I finally had my period and thanks to my strength being used to restore the room at end of the day I actually took control over something which I was feeling quite powerless over. I was so tired of having to bloat, and cramping and feeling depressed over my body doing this to me. Thank God my only teaching assignment begins tomorrow after 11 AM... I also am scheduled for my PM retail job, and that makes me nervous. My PM retail job requires me to be on my feet almost the entire shift. If my P is heavy tomorrow I won't be able to go to work.

I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa with binge/purge subtype about 4 years ago and have been recovered for about 1.5 years now. I stopped attending regular therapy at the one year mark and now just go in if I feel the need to, which rarely happens as I'm always busy with college and other things.I gained alot of weight in recovery and when I stopped therapy I was at a healthy size for my height. However, for the months after the binging was out of control. My restrictive tendencies weren't there but the constant need to binge never faded with it.I went up Jean size and something jn my mind clicked. Now I feel as though I'm becoming too preoccupied with my weight. We don't keep scales in the house but I'm always looking in the mirror and feel awful about my body. I've also started keeping track of my calorie intake again after a year of not counting. I'm not restricting, just being very cautious and anxious about not eating over the recommended amount. Could this be a sign of relapse? I'm not sure if I should be worried at this point.I'm sorry for the whole essay question. I'm just becoming really concerned.

245,iwanttolive,11/17/2018,college,"Hi every one.  I am going to flex my recovery muscle again and I signed up for a college course at my local community college.  My therapist has been consistently urging me to do this and I have many excuses as to why I can't do that, from not being smart enough, never having learned how to write a term paper to not being able to remember what is being said.  Well, she would have none of this so I enrolled. It is payed in full by a pell grant, even my books.  I am able to have help with the disabilities resource department, which allows me to record the classes, take tests in the resource room, take breaks by walking out of the class if I need to and all the help I will need to write a paper at their writing lab where other students will help tutor me in writing a paper if one is required.  The class I want isn't being offered the spring semester, but will probably be offered in the fall.  So the class I am taking is addictions counselling.  My Mom is so happy for me, she wants to buy me a hoodie from the school.  She is so wonderful and a great advocate for me.  I am scared as college is a scary thing and I was very ill when I attempted to go before.  I have a lot of bad memories, but I am going to make new memories and again, flex my recovery muscle.I never say ""my eating disorder', even when I was active in the behaviors and now when talking about it in the past tense.  I never want to give it that power and it never owned me.  But I am saying ""my"" recovery muscle because it is positive and it goes beyond the addictions to food and use of behaviors, including self harm, restrictive eating and overeating.  These things are past tense now.  Sometimes I am tempted to self soothe by eating and I have to ask myself, Am I hungry?  What is the reason I want this food?  What purpose is it serving?  What can I do besides eating when I don't need to.  I am not perfect at it but I am no longer overeating or binging or restricting.  There may be times I eat more than I need, but I then go through those questions and am able to call out to God and redirect.  I read a lot now, something even a few months ago I was unable to do.  I love to read and was so sad that my concentration had become so poor that I was unable to read.  So now I am in the middle of two books.  I am trying to finish the one as it is a library book, then another one from the library, then I will finish one a friend gave me.So off to  school I go on January 23rd.

248,suddenlyyoufind,11/16/2018,Long term recovery - relapse urges,"Hi there! I've been in recovery for the last five years, after a 17 year battle with AN and BN. I finally reached the point 5 years ago when the stars aligned at I was able to stop my ED behaviors. Been living with the guidelines of (a) no food is bad food, (b) make your life bigger than your eating disorder, and (c) you cannot try to change your body. And it has worked, for a long time. But, for some reason... its hard to remember those guidelines these days.I thought I was over this. Things have been really good for a long time, and most of the time, I don't even think about my ED, let alone have urges. But the last six months or so have had a lot of changes - moving multiple times, being far from family and friends, starting grad school and a new field of work - all sorts of things. And my ED has started creeping back in. I've been afraid to admit it, because I've been so proud of being ""recovered"" that I've been lying to myself. I've acted out on ED behaviors an increasing amount for the last two months  - more than I'm willing to admit. When I hadn't - for years. Had one or two slips, during really stressful moments, but that's it. Food is taking a bigger part of my life than it has for a long time. I have a therapist and nutritionist that I started seeing, ostensibly to clean up the lingering bits of my ED - but I'm afraid to tell them I'm struggling. Its complicated why, but I have a good reason for not disclosing to them. I don't think its a full relapse - but I'm on the edge. I'm hoping that this passes soon, and that its just a phase. Life is better without an ED - I know that. Its hard to remember that when times are tough, and I go to my first instinct - but its true.I just don't know what to do.

I have been very focused on my 2 jobs and meal planning for my retail job feels very important to me.If I don't plan my Healthy Meals ahead of time then I found a pattern in needing to binge later at home in the evening.Since I'm on a balanced meal routine I have been doing quite well. I even purchased a pair of pants that fit me just right. I have had a few days off from my 2nd job but have been working almost daily at my primary job. It makes me feel good to work daily.Sometimes when i have extra time to myself i feel afraid of the future. My small apartment which i share w/ brother is affordable currently but I'm still anxious over the rates ever going up while we are here until i turn 50+ in a few yrs.Then I would like to find a place for middle-aged to older persons for a sense of peace and quiet and affordability. God,  I wish job # 1 would award me a raise for being a sub for at least 25 yrs in the public school system. A cost of Living Raise in the burbs of California, to be more specific.

255,mill19,11/05/2018,I'm Afraid I'm Relapsing,"Hi everyone,I’ve never posted in a forum, so I hope I’m doing this correctly. Anyway, I’m writing because I’m afraid I’m slipping back into restricting and other ED habits (so I guess I’m afraid I'm relapsing). I’ve been under a lot of stress lately, and I am also feeling incredibly uncomfortable in my body and with my eating habits. I have’t gained this much weight/gone this far in recovery since I began restricting in June, 2017. i’ve been in this episode of recovery for slightly over a month. I’m orthorexic and anorexic, so I’m highly afraid of sugar in addition to calories in general. Because I deprived myself of sugar (and processed food) for so long, I tend to crave those foods. This is my first time of recovery where I’ve allowed myself to eat sugary processed foods; other times I just increased my calorie intake. So, on Friday I ate a bunch of chocolate. I was so angry with myself and sad afterward, so I texted my nutritionist. She still hasn’t responded though. I feel like I’m just particularly needy in my recovery and an annoying patient that’s over reacting, so I keep telling myself not to contact my nutritionist or therapist. However, there’s another part of my brain that’s screaming at me to reach out because I’ve been letting myself skip snacks and eat smaller meals; I’ve also been restricting sugar and processed food, happier eating alone, and super tempted to count calories. I can’t decide what to do, and I feel so angry with myself any time I break my reemerging rules. I also feel so ashamed of myself because I feel like my nutritionist and therapist think I’m annoying/weak/someone who thinks they have a worse eating disorder than they do. Can anyone please help me figure out what to do? Thank you!",_admin_moderator,"Tue,11/06/2018-10:27pm",Hello and welcome to the,Hello and welcome to the forums.

256,yuqirin,11/02/2018,How do I know when I've recovered from an eating disorder?,"Hi everyone! I'm new here so sorry if I'm posting incorrectly.
I had been ""dieting"" for about 10 months before I realised I had really bad disordered eating, and I was getting all the symptoms of an eating disorder (no period, always cold, losing hair, always tired and irritable etc.) And I told myself that I needed to do something about it, so I decided to start ""recovery"". I'm doing it on my own as a specialist is too expensive, and it's been going on for about a month now. I think I'm doing well but I'm not sure. I've been forcing myself to eat and I've started to develop cravings and binge eating, but I'm telling myself this is necessary for full recovery so I'm just letting my body do its thing. I've regained so much energy and I'm starting to develop an appetite again. I feel like I'm already getting my hunger cues back, but once I eat I can't really stop and I have been snacking on so much chocolate until my stomach physically hurts. I feel much happier and I've started to sweat really bad at night and feel really tired towards the end of the day. I haven't regained my period again, but I did have blood and spotting last week. I have constipation and I feel really gassy and bloated all the time.
I reached an all-time low weight which was when I realised I needed to change, and I'm now at a weight which is healthy for my height. I'm not actually concerned about my weight as I'm just focusing on getting better, and I feel quite lucky that my disordered eating only went on for less than a year. But my question is how do I know when I've recovered from my eating disorder? I think I have developed a good relationship with food as I'm not constantly thinking about it and I let myself eat whatever I want without feeling guilty, and my symptoms seem like I'm pretty much recovered. The only problem is my binging and my inability to stop eating.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,11/06/2018-9:54pm",Edit,Hello and welcome to the forums yuqirin.

258,Lindz25,10/20/2018,Wedding Made Me Relapse!,"So little back story here. I have battled low self esteem since elementary school, battled with eating disorders and exercise addiction since I was 16 years old, and I'm now 26. I have been doing very good for the last few years with only one relapse, and that was when I wanted to look extra amazing in my college graduation dress. I recently got engaged, to the best man in the world sorry ladies ;) and I always had a feeling that would trigger my ED. I was terrified to try on wedding dresses! Like I had a slight panic attack in the store before trying them on (not like me). I tried on quite a few and actually thought I looked amazing in every one of them and was so proud of how far I've come and that I could look in the mirror and love my body. Bought a very form fitting and comfortable dress and it's perfect. However, after I bought it my mind starting telling me, ""But if you lost only like a few pounds it would look so much better!"" And that's when the relapse started. I started ""cutting carbs"" which lead to only carbs from fruits and veg, and I started consuming alcohol (classis sign for me that I'm sick again), and scheduling extra workouts in. It lasted about 3 weeks and I was able to catch it, but man it sure messed me up. I feel like there is sooo much pressure to look your absolute best on your wedding day that it just got to me. A person who doesn't have a past like mine can easily want to lose a few pounds and it's ok, but for anyone with an ED past, I just dont know how that can work. Just curious if anyone else has triggers like these? And if so, any advice would be very appreciated! Above all, I want to be mentally healthy for my wedding day!

260,nannerpancake,09/02/2018,Slip-up after long term recovery,"I've been recovered for about five years now. I always use the term recoverED instead of recoverING, because I thought my recovery was solid and unshakeable, and that I'd never go back to my ED. But for last few months I've had the ED thoughts start to creep back in. I dove right back into ED recovery circles and world, to try to get myself back out of that slump and remind me of the reasons I chose recovery, but my thoughts have just been getting worse. Lots of urges, lots of my old thoughts about my body that I thought I was over.  I think this is all because I'm at a major transition point in my life, and also because my body has changed lately. Changes are hard!But yesterday, for the first time in a very long time, I acted out on behaviors. It really freaked me out! I feel like such a hypocrite, because I actively work in eating disorder advocacy and treatment, and I am open about being RecoverED... but I had a slip-up. I know that one slip-up doesn't mean a relapse, but I am so scared of relapsing! And so scared of anyone knowing that I'm struggling.

I'm losing my ability to cope with the outside stress and my anxiety taking hold of everything and making it just that much worse.  I haven't been sleeping much, and I've been obsessing over every single detail of my life.  I panic if I can't figure out what I want to eat because I have options.  It gets to the point where I can't think straight.  I can't even read my homework sometimes because I'm so terrified I won't understand that the words on the page don't even look like words anymore.  Today, I just couldn't deal with all the panic and overwhelming situations my anxiety puts me in and self-harmed.  I feel so ashamed.  I feel like I'm letting everyone around me down.  I feel like I'm letting my therapist down.  That hurts so much.  I hate to see her disappointed or upset.  I want to make her happy.  I feel so weak, that I don't deserve her.  That I don't deserve anyone.  I'm not even upset that I did it to myself, just that I know it will make others sad.  I wish I could just disappear so I can never again be the cause of pain.

266,cjenkins12,09/02/2018,Unsure how much to exercise,"Hi, It might be a bit unfair to post on this forum as I don't feel I have an eating disorder so much. As I am underweight though, after loosing weight a few years ago, I'm also really trying to gain weight at the moment. I'm just a bit unsure what approach to have towards exercise with the weight I'm currently at. I've read really mixed things online - some completely advising against exercising until a healthy BMI is reached, just focusing on eating more, but others suggesting including regular exercise is a much healthier approach to take and will in fact help the process. Although I know it depends on the type of exercise. I know I would definitely like to begin incorporating more strengthening sessions (e.g. with weights) once I've gained a bit more weight so that I put on muscle as well as fat but I'm unsure when to begin this. I was thinking perhaps once I've put on some weight? At the moment though, other than walking, the only exercise I'm doing is yoga and cycling each week, as well as stretches each day. I'm unsure whether it might be sensible to do more exercise than this now though? And, if not, at what point it would be a good time to begin regularly doing weight and general strengthening exercises? Would hugely appreciate any advice!

267,Eat_everything,08/31/2018,1 Year and still haven't recovered completely,"Hello! I'm a 20 year-old male who used to suffer from an eating disorder. 3.5 years ago, as I was a chubby teen, I started hitting the gym and eating clean. A few months in, I began monitoring my body image and the drastic change it underwent didn't passed unnoticed. I started obsessing about the purity of my daily meals, developing a mental disorder known as Orthorexia Nervosa. After a couple of months, my body image had gone from chubby to much more thin. I was very satisfied and determined to continue restricting food groups and calories until the side effects came up. My stomach started to bloat like a balloon nearly after every meal (no matter the quantity), my heart beat was very fast and intense (palpitations) and the most annoying...insomnia. I was so stressed because of it and I couldn't understand why it was happening to me (being in perfect shape and health with my so called perfect diet). Even though my body reacted like that, my mind stayed obsessed and I didn't change my eating habits right away. A few months after the appearance of these symptoms, I started eating more food but I was still restricting food groups and this kept on for about 2 years with my weight and image fluctuating from fit to underweight. However, the last summer while browsing the net I stumbled upon some articles and videos which made me realize: I wasn't on a special diet or plan which was ok because the calories were not deadly low. I had an eating disorder just as serious as anorexia nervosa in respect to the mental health part. Anyway, 1 year ago I began eating all kinds of foods and an adequate amount. I gained weight, but my symptoms haven't gone away completely. My difficulty to fall asleep has subsided, but my stomach still bloats very often and my heart beats crazy intensely after the majority of my meals. Is it normal to be like that after 1 year in recovery?  Should I gain more weight to help my body get over it? When will I recover completely?",_admin_moderator,"Sat,09/01/2018-1:56pm",Post edited,"Hi Eat_everything, Your post was edited sligthly to remove numbers and detailed body descriptions, as these may be triggering for other forum members.

If they offer me a job and its at a good school w/ decent co-workers and other TA's and teachers who work well as a team, and orient me into their classroom as a newbie on board, then I would love to work for that school as a new hire TA. Subbing pays more but TA position is usually only at 1 school w/ a regular staff and classroom do not change daily. This consistency is good. However, I enjoy sub teaching. I also have an interview coming up soon for a non-profit after hours, on-call job. I need to figure out how to even get to the interview site. An interview is scheduled for next week. It seems to be near a bus stop so may take a bus as we have a bus stop right in front of the new apartments where I now reside. I have been doing well w/, my Ed-0NOS ED atypical eating. Just a touch of orthorexia. I feel anxious about shopping for food. The price of food adds to my anxiety too. It seems as though the healthier the food I choose the more expensive it is. I also shop for my brother whenever I spot a sale of something he and I both may like to share for dinner. It is just the money part that I also associate w/ entering the grocery store that has begun making me extra anxious while on a Summer budget and now w/ new higher rent it is also a tad more anxiety producing.",_admin_moderator,"Sat,08/04/2018-3:36pm",We wanted to let you know,"Hi chunkymonkey68,We wanted to let you know your post was edited to remove information that could be  triggering to other forum users. Community Guidelines can be reviewed here: https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/forums/community-guidelinesThanks and keep posting!  ",,,,

My therapist said what type of eating disorder i have but i can't find it in the internet. I'm also a lesbian and 4 months ago we broke up and i started to engage in behaviors. After that i couldn't eat and i've lost weight. I've started to go to a therapist about 2 months ago. I feel i recovered a little bit. But every time my girlfriend texts me i go back to ED behaviors again and start to feel hopeless and sad. After we broke up i talk to her again and we get back together. But my actions and feeling depressive was never gone. So i started to cut all my communication with her. But she keeps writing me back because she thinks we are on a break and i can't tell her that i wanna break up because i'm afraid that she reply angerly and say things that will hurt me. We don't have much choise in turkey about mental health care.

My therapist has been working with me on it but I am becoming stubborn. My first slip up was after many people had commented on my weight gain from my medication. I began restricting and lost a reasonable amount of weight. My therapist began helping me with my day to day diet and it worked for a while. But lately I have felt an extreme loss of control. I lost my job and have suffered financially and my therapist who I am very attached to is going to be leaving in a month and I have to deal with the fact that I might never see her again after she's changed my life so much. On top of it I'm going to be transferring schools. These problems might not seem big but I feel like I'm losing everything I have. To cope I'm now obsessing over my weight desperate to lose ""just a few more lbs."" feeding my mind with pro ana nonsense and obsessively weighing myself. I want to be healthy and my therapist and my boss both told me that I'm heading down a very dangerous path.

276,haiku,07/18/2018,Panic Attacks after Eating ,"Hello! I have had an eating disorder since I was 17 (I'm now 20, about to turn 21 next week.) Something that is a huge stumbling block in recovery is the fact I am prone to panic attacks after eating. This usually occurs if I eat a little more than I'm used to, for example in a restaurant, because fullness is somewhat of a trigger. It triggers me to use various kinds of eating disorder behaviors. Sometimes I get panic attacks if I haven't exercised that particular day, or even if my eating pattern has been normal and frankly it's so debilitating. Recovery is like a full time job, except you don't get paid for it and when this thing keeps happening it feels like such a kick in the teeth. It's soul destroying at times to have done all his hard work to be triggered into a panic attack by the one thing we need to keep us alive. Can anyone relate? Does anyone have any advice? You have no idea how much I'd appreciate it! <3 Big love to everyone,

277,Empower23,07/15/2018,"Developing ED, traveling to europe, scared of gaining weight.","Hi there. I wasn't diagnosed yet but I feel like I have some symptoms of a developing ED.To sum it up, I was chubby and got bullied by family and ex boyfriend in the past, so I became into fitness, lost weight and started working out, which I really enjoy.
But lately I feel like things are out of control. I can only feel guilty everytime I eat something that's not in my meal plan (I go to a dietitian who helps me gain muscle and maintain body fat at lean levels). I am extremely scared of gaining fat, keep dreaming about food, I'm feeling detached from my current boyfriend, avoiding partying so I don't have alcohol, I'm moody all the time and being a pain in the a** to people around me, working out A LOT more than before, etc... I am obssessing over my shape all the time.The thing is:I'm going to Europe next week with my boyfriend. We saved for this trip for years in advance and I was really excited about this life experience with the person I want to marry someday! We'll be spending 18 days in the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland.And all I can think about is: gonna get fat from trying wonderful, typical local foods and not working out once (the hotels don't have gyms, I'm just walking)I'm overthinking this trip a lot and getting really anxious. Everyone say I should relax and accept a potential slight weight gain, saying I can lose it back in no time when I come home. Life experiences are unique and I don't get to travel much (once every 6 years or so, I almost never went abroad). I thought about 2 different approaches: either I will restrict myself, only eat clean foods and be in my ""safe ED zone"" or I will enjoy what I want, have mostly healthy, real-food meals and also let myself drink beer with my bf, try desserts and different foods I don't have at home.Do you guys think I should LET GO of those thoughts and force myself to eat whatever I want, even though I gain some weight, just to reset my mind and keep this iminent ED from totally taking control of my life? I feel like traveling is, somehow, a possibility to go out of my comfort zone and see how bigger the world really is, how much there is out there to be enjoyed and also how great it would be to strenght my relationship. I feel like if I actually gained weight, I would force myself to get used to that and love my body anyways. I feel like I need to enjoy the trip at max and win this mental game I tricked myself into!Thoughts? Anyone been on a trip?

So I had active anorexia for 4 years, and was put into the only clinic in my area which was, to put it gently, garbage. I was given no emotional support for my recovery, put on medication on the first day, and then later given a medication that contributed to almost all of my weight gain. I increased my overall intake, but not to normal and not nearly enough for recovery. The trauma of the clinic sent me back into dissociation (which was my default coping mechanism for other traumas as well), so not only did I barely increase my intake, but I coped by blocking out all feeling. So here I am. It's been almost 3 years and essentially I'm at the same place I was before. The old feelings and realization of my habits are coming back. I know I can't keep this up forever. But right now the fear of gaining more weight is beating the fear of being like this forever.

I had texted her about how I also want to die most of the time and i said my parents should look at who in part caused that like they were concerned with that rather then hearing out how i felt. my therapist also agreed and was like yea and they were worried he would kill himself after watching you try to kill yourself for years...and to be honest most of the time still want to die...i dont' wish harm on him i really don't but he caused me a lot of pain,_admin_moderator,"Tue,06/12/2018-10:06am",Suicide Prevention Resource ,"Hi hermione3, I am sorry to hear you are still struggling.  Please consider contacting the Suicide Hotline if you are feeling suicidal at 1-800-273-TALK.

287,WarriorMama,05/26/2018,Recovery with no supporr,"So I am absolutely doing amazing. I stopped obsessively weighing myself. I am consistently over a healthy amount of calories. I woke up one day and made my own recovery plan with my own calorie goal benchmarks each week. I have had so much success in two weeks that I’ve amazed even myself. But.
Going through ana recovery without any support is brutal sometimes. I have to say that quitting smoking was easier.
There are times that I think the reason why I’m successful this time is because I don’t have a super loud cheering squad. There are other times I get so angry that I don’t get cheered on and celebrated by husband for overcoming really hard milestones for me. Then I think to myself, “come on, you’re a grown ass women...you shouldn’t need a party every time you do something that’s hard for you”.
I was at my max calorie amount and my husband wanted a movie night which means a lot of candy and sugary drinks. I still stayed up and vegged out with him- that was huge for me. I didn’t restrict myself the next day or have a mental breakdown. I gained weight and I completely stunned myself by not even caring.
I know it’s stupid but I’m so angry at him for not realizing how huge that was for me and just how hard it was to eat all that extra junk food knowing I was crossing my calorie limit. After so many fights in the past being centred around ana you’d think he’d be my #1 fan but he isn’t...he has flat out told me that he doesn’t care anymore or want to hear about how much I’ve gained or how many calories I eat.

290,findingbalance92,05/10/2018,Comments from the public& struggle with recovery,"Hello everybody,
This is my first post and I am quite nervous and hope everything I am writing is appropriate.
I have been in recovery for 1 year and 3 months now, I had a relapse 7 months after first attempting recovery, but have been good ever since. In my past I had issues with over exercising and bulimia. I was never underweight and probably in the lower healthy weight range. Due to recovery I have now gained some weight, which put me in the overweight range. I am struggling to find a balance with my eating, some days are better, some days are worse. Which really scares me that since I've gained all this weight, my blood lipid levels have worsened and I've developed arthritis in my knees, making it impossible for me to do the high intensity exercise I relied on earlier in times I needed this extra endorphine kick and to ""keep me in shape"". I am very unhappy with how my body looks and feels and am not able to accept it the way it is now. I was never overweight, and a very skinny child. My family is quite averse to weight gain and I am studying a nutrition related degree. I feel like I am being judged by friends and strangers, the other day I was even being asked about my weight gain in a very insensitive way. This really has triggered feelings from the past. I am quite uncertain on how to proceed, I don't think I can/ want to accept my current body, as it is obviously putting me at risk of other health issues and I am basically withdrawing myself from all social events and even friends. On the other hand I don't want to fall back into old behaviours. I am hardly engaging in any social activities any more, don't like to dress nicely and am basically isolating myself from events which require to dress up and look nice. I feel like I am in a vicious cycle, which I don't know how to escape anymore... has anyone else experienced similar feelings? I had a psychiatrist for a while, which led me on the way to recovery.

293,livroseclarke,04/05/2018,Struggling in Recovery,"Hi, I just felt as if I needed to share because I've been really struggling emotionally lately.
I am currently in recovery for anorexia, depression, and anxiety and have been for around half a year. Recovery was really important to me, but lately it seems only as if food served as a comfort rather than a fear.
Daily I have been engaging in eating disorder behaviors and I feel horribly about it. There are occasional times in which I will attempt other eating disorder behaviors, but none of my attempts have been successful. After checking my weight at a doctor's appointment a few days ago, I found that I gained slight weight, which really shocked and irritated me (which truthfully was to my surprise- I had thought body image wasn't as much of an issue to me).
Additionally, my sister is demonstrating very anorexia-like symptoms, which really scares me.
Self harm has been a coping strategy for me in the past, and I have recently picked up self harm again, but have been very closely watched ever since my parents found out, so I feel as if I cannot release everything I am feeling.
To summarize, restricting is a really appealing thought to me at this point, but I fear demonstrating poor eating habits in front of my sister. Does anyone have any suggestions on these kind of recovery thoughts?",_admin_moderator,"Sun,04/08/2018-8:20pm",Post Edited,"Hi livroseclarke, welcome to the forums!

295,rd32596,03/27/2018,Invisible Illness,"Addiction affects more than one would expect, in different ways and forms.  No one experience is like another, which is why my intentions with this paper are what they are.  Ideally, with the submission of this to forums, I am raising awareness and sharing my story to others who need support and to feel they are not alone.  My experience with addiction started in high school and took many different turns throughout the years, still following me daily.  I am aware of what I have been through, and I am strong enough to listen to it, feel it, and rise above it.  I, along with the help of family, friends, and medical professionals, have been provided with the tools to conquer.  It is important to remember that addiction does not discriminate.  No matter who you are, what you do, or what you come from, this disease will sneak its way into your life.
	I was introduced to this realm sophomore year of high school but I wasn’t wise or aware enough to recognize how broad the world of addiction is.  I was diagnosed with an eating disorder, which contrary to popular belief is an addiction.  I became obsessed with, more so addicted, to control.  It was tiring, sickening, and affected not only me but also the ones around me.  This started all around the time my parents were going through a divorce, surrounding me with constant arguments and changes in my life.  The only thing that was stable in my life was school, the gym, and rowing, all having to be sacrificed for my eating disorder.  I was consumed with numbers.  It became all I cared about.  My relationships fell apart because I put no effort into saving them; I only cared about losing weight.  My family was fed up with me; I was setting a poor example for my three younger sisters.  My eating disorder spoke to me, telling me they were just jealous I was losing weight, but also telling me I needed to stay on target and starve myself.  I had no energy to be a good person, sister, or daughter.  When outpatient therapy wasn’t enough, my parents admitted me into inpatient therapy.  It was extremely frustrating because I missed in total five weeks of school being admitted twice.  My first round was very rough, I hated being told what to eat and what to do, share my feelings and experiences with strangers who didn’t understand me.  I was very resistant to help but realized that I could fake it until I made it, which is just what I did.  It didn’t work out for me though, because two months after I was sent right back.  I did it right that time; being open to what I was exposed to.  I saw elderly people who let their eating disorder control their whole life, realizing that this is not what I wanted to live with.  It was weird because I truly loved my eating disorder because it gave me the tools to be a better (looking) person, but I also hated what it had done to my life.   My eating disorder took away a lot from me; I wasn’t allowed to stay on the rowing team, I missed school, and I was constantly fighting with my parents.  I consider myself now recovered, even though I still hear the voices in my head every day.  I have been provided with the tools to silence those voices, and I never deprive myself anymore.  I was able to work with my school to ensure my grades stayed where I wanted them, and despite the odds, was able to graduate early.  My relationship with my family is stronger than ever, and I am proud to say I have become a positive role model for my sisters.
	Senior year of high school I was prescribed medication for severe anxiety “as needed.”  By the time I was a freshman in college, I had become very dependent on these pills.  I was very lonely; I had no friends and was extremely homesick.  I took the medication on a regular basis, when I thought I “needed” it.  Two months into my first semester, I started having seizures that gradually got worse.  No one knew what it was from and I had no medical history of epilepsy.  Ten seizures, all on the URI campus; I was so confused and scared.  I ended my freshman year early, on April 1st, the day I knocked out three teeth in a horrible grand mal seizure.  I was then admitted into the hospital for testing and monitoring my episodes.  I had no seizures during my stay, and they adjusted and kept me on the medication.  It took another seizure to understand that I was experiencing withdrawals from when I would take the medication.  I had no idea I was addicted to it; I would’ve never expected myself to be addicted to a pill or anything for that matter.  Once I got off the pills, my health was stable and restored.
	If that wasn’t enough, a few months later my younger sister, who was 17 at the time, began using drugs.  For a while she hid it very effectively, but her life started to crash around her and all of us.  No one understood what she was going through or why she couldn’t just stop.  It was exceedingly tedious and agonizing to watch her cry in a mental hospital begging us to take her home.  I wasn’t able to handle balancing the stress and school, and spent all my free time driving to whichever hospital she was at the time.  My grades started dropping, and I left school for a semester to focus on her and my own mental health.  Months went by, and she made a remarkable recovery.  Everything started falling back into place for the first time in years.  She is now on the Deans List at her university and excelling at everything she does, all while maintaining her sobriety.
	Every encounter with addiction is different, and they all have their own distinct qualities.  However, all benefit from one thing: support.  Ideally, this paper will touch others who have experienced similar happenings.  My journey from self-destruction to self-realization has been a rough one, but I’ve learnt so much about myself from it.  I have risen above, despite the bumps in the road along the way.  I have betrayed myself along with having been betrayed by others.  I was tricked into driving one of my best friends to get drugs, only realizing it shortly after when he was overdosing in my car.  I’ve had to distance myself and remove myself from relationships, but I have also reinforced and created new healthy relationships.  I am content where my life is now.
	To those reading this, you are never alone.  I hope my words can reach out and touch those who need support.  There is a light at the end of the tunnel and once you find it, it’s incredible.  I would not be who I am now if I had not gone through my journey with addiction, and I believe that I am a stronger person because of it.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,03/28/2018-12:41pm",Hi rd32596!

296,lmd0137,03/29/2018,What am I?,"This is my first time posting here. I would like to share about myself and I am wondering if I am alone in some of these things. I am on a road to recovery. However, my recovery is from a lot more than an eating disorder. In fact this is the first time I am talking about my eating issues honestly. I am seeking support and help for the first time for my struggles with food, body image, and extreme emotions/behaviors. I am a survivor of child abuse, domestic violence, and rape. I am a single mom to a preschooler. I work two jobs and I am a full time student. I live an extremely stressful life. It has been just over two years since I left my abusive situation and began the road to recovery from a lifetime of abuse. I am in a safe place now and I am receiving help from d.v. and rape crisis center as well as therapy for ptsd. But my eating has been triggered...badly!
I have never officially been diagnosed with an eating disorder even though I have struggled with this since I was very young. It got really bad around the age of 13 and I have been on a roller coaster of self-destructive eating behaviors for 17 years now. I have been good at hiding my issues. But after everything I have faced and overcome, I am ready to face this now too. My biggest problem is that I don't know how define the disorder that I have. I don't know if I fit into a category. I feel alone.
From the time I was very young (around 8 yo) I had a problem with ""emotional eating."" Food was used as a weapon in our home. It was either withheld or forced on us in copious amounts. I began dealing with being overweight and teased when I was in second grade. When I hit middle school the starvation began. The feeling of hunger did not bother me because I was accustomed to it. I would go weeks and sometimes months without eating or barely taking bites of vegetables. During these phases I would also exercise to excess. I could not and would not eat anything pleasurable. I did this for the same reason I always do when I am on a starvation kick. If I taste of food that I find satiating it initiates a feeding frenzy that I cannot control. I am like a shark who has tasted blood and I have no ability to stop myself. The problem is that sometimes a binge for me can also go on for weeks or months at a time. I struggle to reign my self back in. When I do gain control I go back to starvation. I am never in the middle eating a balanced or healthy amount of food. This is far more extreme than the yo-yo dieting I have always joked that I have. My weight fluctuations are dramatic and have done a lot of damage to my body (including high cortisol levels and a slowed metabolism). I struggle with my weight and self image to the point where I avoid seeing people I know in public because I do not want them to see my weight. This happens at both ends of the spectrum. I am never satisfied with my body and I am always ashamed about my eating whether its too little or too much.
Currently I am stuck in a binge that I cannot control and I am at my breaking point. The binge started right before thanksgiving. I have put on considerable weight in 4 months because I just cannot stop this frenzy. I am unhappy with myself and extremely tempted to go into starvation mode. But my health is suffering and I don't want to repeat this cycle anymore. What is this disorder? Its confusing lonely and scary.
Does anyone else get stuck in a binge like this? Does anyone else have similar struggles?",_admin_moderator,"Sun,04/01/2018-5:56pm",Post Edited,"Hi lmd0137, welcome to the forums and thank you for sharing your story.

300,izzypizzy,03/14/2018,"Discharge from residential, directly to outpatient","Hi! I'm new here but wanted to see if anyone has had a similar experience. I was discharged from residential treatment a week and a half ago after two months. I weight restored and was in a much better place and felt ready to move on. However, when I returned home I found out that the discharge plan that my insurance created for me didn't actually exist. Since then, I've been bounced around between outpatient programs. I haven't had any appointments besides initial intakes with therapists I never see again. I refused my insurance IOP program originally after spending three months there spiraling before I was referred to residential. The IOP team agrees that their consequence-based method does not work for me (if I did not finish a meal in under 30 minutes I was not allowed to stay for group) and will not accept me back. I have three locations through my insurance that are all recommending I go to one of the others and none of them are communicating. I am advocating for myself and trying to get to an appropriate level of care, but I'm continuously being told outpatient treatment with therapy, dietician, and medical appointments once every three weeks is my only option. The best place for me right now would be PHP or an out-of-network IOP, but my insurance refuses to cover those. The shift from 24/7 support to absolutely nothing has been incredibly overwhelming and I am already relapsing. Every day without treatment the ED voice gets a little louder and I use more behaviors. I am so frustrated and tired of fighting, and I feel like giving up and letting the eating disorder take over so that maybe they'll be more willing to help. I feel like I am expected to do the rest on my own and I'm embarrassed that two months in residential wasn't enough for me to become completely self-reliant. Does anyone have any advice for dealing with insurance in general? Has anyone successfully made the transition straight from residential to outpatient?

302,Reclaimer18,03/02/2018,Living on the Edge,"I have struggled with Anorexia for the last 8 years of my life. There are so many factors, both as a result of ""nature and nurture"" causes, that I developed my ED I believe, and after awhile I have come to realize that it doesn't really matter what began my ED, rather, what I choose to do now in the midst of my struggle that counts. I will never be able to truly move forward in the recovery process if I continue to analyze and dissect the past, remaining stuck in the ""should'ves and could'ves.""

But, I am hesitant to dive back in to continual sessions with my Therapist and Dietitian due to my schedule, feeling ""safe"" where I am at and I have to admit, apprehensive about my Dietitian taking full control of my meal plan again.

304,AnjaOak,02/21/2018,Nerve pain triggered in ED recovery phase,"Hi there,I'm reaching out to see if anyone has had problems with pain/neuropathy that was only triggered *after* recovery.I had orthorexia for four years - restricted during the week, and binge ate/drank over weekends. I never struggled with any form of physical pain or discomfort during the ED, and was extremely active. I didn't have muscle atrophy, and although I was underweight, I looked fit and had good muscle tone. In November last year, I took the decision to quit my ED cold turkey, before getting married. I didn't go via a dietitian or counsellor. I started eating everything in sight, in an effort to gain weight. The biggest change, apart from the quantities, was going from a very lean diet, to an extremely carb-heavy diet. After about 10 days, I started to develop nerve pain in my feet, which has now travelled all the way up my legs, and even into my hands and face. I also get terrible cramp-like sensations, which are worsened with activity. I have been unable to exercise since then, and the problem only seems to be spreading. I currently have a diagnosis of idiopathic peripheral neuropathy. Once again, I want to emphasise that this is not a result of malnutrition, as it began very clearly and distinctly during my recovery phase, and not before. I have searched for everything under the sun, but have found nothing that clearly links ED recovery with neuropathy (although long-term malnutrition does cause neuropathy). I have been for blood tests and MRIs, and nothing is abnormal. So far, the only explanation that doctors can give me, is that it might be an autoimmune response (e.g. an acquired dietary intolerance, even though I did eat all food groups during my ED - just in limited quantities).Any help, guidance or advice would be appreciated. This has become a literal disability, and I am unable to do all the things I would normally do.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,02/21/2018-12:28pm",Hello AnjaOak! Welcome to the,"Hello AnjaOak!

Anyways, I am trying to figure out this edema thing.  I have read enough now to understand and accept why it's happening, but I can't seem to find any information on how it goes away, and what I should be seeing after almost 2 weeks of severe water retention.
I am on my 11th laxative-free/crazy edema body day, and I am experiencing some watery stools.
This worries me due to my past laxative abuse, and yet, how else is the water retention going to go away?
I just want to know whether I should be expecting watery stools as my edema goes away, or if it's something to worry about?
Also, I've only had edema for 11+ days...I have read that others experience it for months and even YEARS (so scary)...is my edema possibly going away too soon because I'm doing something wrong?
I am eating tons of food/calories, although it is all extremely healthy and very fibrous.
I can't go to a doctor because I don't have insurance and I'm broke living in San Francisco haha, and I hate going to a doctor anyway...so if anyone has some knowledge on refeeding edema, or could share their experience with it, I would greatly appreciate it!

            iwanttolive My mom helps me with so much and I feel I owe it to her to do everything she suggests.  I sincerely don't know what to do.   I am fifty but because I am so dependet on everything my parent's tell me to do or suggest, I feel stuck and not able to make a decision for myself.  I would appreciate any insight into this.  Thank you.                                                       iwanttolive",_admin_moderator,"Mon,02/26/2018-4:51pm","Hi iwanttolive, Your post has","Hi iwanttolive, Your post has been edited a bit.

307,iwanttolive,02/13/2018,it's a choice and acceptance for me,"Hi friends,I am in a place where I have to choose to accept my body even though it is at a weight I do not like.  For me it is a choice now.  I can be mad or disgusted or shamed, but I must choose acceptance.   I just turned fifty,  I rarely engage in eating disorder behaviors.  Going close shopping is difficult, but I do not want to allow what I look like to rule my moods and the way I feel about myself.  I am me, and I will still be me even at a higher weight.  Easy? No.  But necessary to continue on my journey of recovery.   I have been free from self harm thoughts and actions for about three weeks now and I will continue on in that vain.  I am pursuing health and a healthy mind.  It takes work.  I have to say when I start thinking badly, NO, it won't change anything if I do this or that.  So, I am back on track and even though I miss my old body, and the ""sick"" look, I want to be well..  I don't want the sick look.  I want to shine for Jesus.  To shine to help others.  To shine so I can go to Nigeria.   I hope this helps someone out there.   I really care about you all.  Take care,

308,Elara,02/05/2018,Anyone take appetite-stimulating medicine for years?,"A few months ago my family doctor prescribed a medication to help boost my appetite.  I love this medicine and I take a very small dose.My question is, are there people who take these kinds of medicine for years in order to help them be able to eat?  Is that common/normal?   The therapist I'm seeing thinks that the reason I don't enjoy eating has to do with childhood experiences.  I'm alright seeing her for a good while to see if therapy helps.  But I'm also enjoying the effects of this medicine and thinking ""can't this just be my solution?""  Because it makes such a difference, and it DOES help.  And I have never wanted to be thin or worried about what my body looked like or anything.  It's just that I just don't enjoy eating very much, and am frequently too nervous to eat.  Just wondering if anyone stays on meds of this sort for years.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,02/07/2018-12:52pm",Hi Elara. Welcome to the,"Hi Elara. Welcome to the forums!

309,dmack24,01/24/2018,Will I ever stop gaining weight?,"I restricted food/dieted and binged for over 15 years. I began recovery in June of this year. I stopped my outpatient treatment in November because I felt I was at a point in my recovery where I could. Things are going well except that I still feel distressed over my weight gain sometimes. I have gained weight since I started recovery in June. I am scared it will never stop, let alone go down. Through the entire course of my ED I was “overweight”. Now I am “obese”. My mentality towards fat and fat phobia has changed enough that I have been able to recover and I understand that I am looking at years for my weight to stabilize. It’s hard when most resources talk about weight gain in anorexia recovery or even weight loss in binge eating recovery, but I was never either of those. I don’t know what is going to happen. Shouldn’t this stop at some point? And even go the other direction? Is there anyone else out there like me?",_admin_moderator,"Thu,01/25/2018-6:14pm",Edit,"dmack24, Thank you so much for posting on the NEDA forums.  We just would like to remind to keep numbers out of the forums.  You can check out our community guidelines if you would like to check out the forum rules!

310,ni1998,01/09/2018,How do you deal with other people triggering you?,"I've been dealing with an eating disorder (anorexia) since I was 12, now I am 19. I'm 1 month and 3 days in and I'm loving every second, I feel like I'm really freeing myself of this sick mindset I used to maintain for years. It feels so free. I get scared and anxious a lot but I keep going. I have no other option if I want to be happy and in peace.But even my loved ones keep saying things that sound disordered like comments about what they eat and how it makes them feel guilty after indulging. It makes me feel really bad. My chest gets tight and I feel a strong anxiety rising. I've been meditating for roughly 2.5  months now so sometimes I'm glad I have the chance to deal with the anxiety that rises in such situations, let myself feel it and try to not engage with any bad thoughts that may arise from me or try to ease the anxiety by engaging in ED behavior. But I just wish people would understand, they hurt me so much and they don't even realize it.How do you people deal with it? Do you experience such things in a regular basis?I know what I have to do but I want to hear from people who really understand what this is like.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,01/10/2018-12:21pm",Hi ni1998!

311,Yas99min,01/09/2018,Am i wrong to hold on to the past?,"Ok so i suffered with ednos when i was in school, I’m back to the way i was before ednos now for the past 4-5 years (well as much as i can be). But when i was suffering i was workin out on a cross trainer and it was contributing to losing weight. I haven’t used the cross trainer since those days but me and my boyfriend argue all the time about it because it takes up a lot of room and doesn’t get used. He says if I don’t get rid of it then he will. I know he’s right because it doesn’t get used. But it feels like safety for me if you get what i mean? I feel like i need to have it here whether i use it or not, just in case. I get really upset because I don’t want to get rid of it even though I don’t have the motivation or time to go on it. But i was wondering if anyone has this problem? I tried explaining it to him but we weren’t together when i was going through it all so he just doesn’t understand. Am i so wrong for wanting to keep it?",_admin_moderator,"Wed,01/10/2018-12:31pm",Hi Yas99min! We are glad that,"Hi Yas99min! We are glad that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.
