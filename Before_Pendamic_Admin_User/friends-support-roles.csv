My best friend, who is also my roomie has been struggling with binge eating disorder for a very long time. For the time I’ve known her she has gone through up and down cycles. Sometimes she will go without binging for some time, but just when I think she is starting to recover and make progress she binges. Her binges have been getting consistently worse everytime recently to the point where she will eat until she passes out and it last for days. I have tried to help in many ways. I have been supportive, understanding and patient. I am getting frustrating though because she has stolen food from me multiple times. We have set boundaries, but she has broken them. I am torn apart and am not sure what to do because she is my best friend. I want to be supportive and understanding still but I am getting to a breaking point. Please help me, I have no idea what to do.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,01/13/2020-2:25am",Medical Symptoms,"Hi Itseemmmmaa - you mentioned some concerning symptoms in your post, and we wanted to affirm that this is a sign for which your friend may need to seek medical attention. The following are just some of the signs of a serious problem that demands immediate medical attention:

1,c0nc3rn3d,11/17/2019,"College roommate may be struggling, should I notify parents?","I've been rooming with my best friend this first semester of college and I've noticed some behaviors that may be indicative of an eating disorder. I'm worried I may have provoked it. I'm also wondering if I should talk to her parents. I'll start with a back story.We've been close friends since seventh grade and while she never overindulged, she seemed to eat an adequate amount of calories while she was under her parents roof.  You can probably tell by this description that she's a picky eater, and that hasn't changed... now it just seems that she eats much less. I've heard a lot of ""I'm just not hungry""s and ""I'm tired of the food on campus."" But we have some of the highest ranking on campus dining in America. Even I, as a vegan, haven't gotten sick of the food because we have SO MANY OPTIONS. Which brings me to my next point...Even though I eat in abundance, my diet is restrictive by definition, and I'm hoping my choice to follow this lifestyle isn't causing her to change the way she eats. While I would love to see people stop eating animals, they need to replace it with healthy whole foods, not nothing. Could this be because when people ask me why I'm vegan, one of my answers is that the agricultural industry is bad for the environment? I want to give people an honest answer, and I think they deserve to know the truth, but if this could be causing her to struggle with what she eats I don't want that.We also have a suite mate who has struggled with eating disorders, and still lives with one. Even though she now eats a very balanced diet and gets a proper amount of calories everyday, she still talks a lot about the amount of calories in everything she eats, and occasionally over-exercises, which could be triggering to my roommate. I'm not sure. Either way, even she has expressed concerns to me about my roommate potentially having an ED.I make many efforts to encourage her to eat such as being intentional about going to meals with her (while this usually works, I like to do spiritual fasts and I also just have my own schedule sometimes, during these times that I don't ask her to get food with me she usually just won't get it at all). I don't want to completely jump to conclusions. She doesn't show many of the typical signs of an ED such as counting calories, excessive exercise, eating healthy, low cal foods, or body checking. The only thing I have noticed is that she simply doesn't eat enough food. She is a picky eater. She really could be telling the truth when she says she's sick of the food here. Which leads me to my final question...Should I bring up my concerns to her parents? We'll be going home for thanksgiving break this weekend and I'm wondering if I should let them know to be on the lookout for any changes in the way she eats compared to the way she ate before coming off to college. Will she continue her patterns of eating inadequately or eat enough now that she has a variety of comforting food at her exposure?I don't want to ruin our friendship over my possible overreacting, so I want to be very careful about who I tell and the way I tell it. While we're best friends, it can be hard for her to be vulnerable with me and I don't want to ruin the little bit of vulnerability and lose her trust in me because I told her parents or accused her of something that isn't as big of a deal as I built it up to be.Thank you in advance :)",_admin_moderator,"Mon,11/18/2019-10:15am","Dear c0nc3rn3d, we would like","Dear c0nc3rn3d, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove mentions of specific food items, which could be tiggering to others and therefore are not allowed on the forums.

3,Chad123,03/14/2019,Friend in Need,"My friend has a disorder that's similar, but unlike any of the other disorders that I've seen on the internet so far. He does not enjoy the taste of most foods and his body does not give off the same hunger signals that most people get, so he is not hungry, but not eating enough and what he eats his body usually tries to reject because it tastes so bad to him. The only times I've been able to get him to eat with me is buying going out and getting fast food. I worry that he is not getting enough nutrition. Because he is not eating enough he is also very skinny and gets weak very easily. I was wondering if anyone knew any foods that are really good at helping someone gain weight/get needed vitamins that's either in the fast food industry or something that could be easy to make at home. Unfortunately, I don't have much experience with dealing with someone with an eating disorder, so I'm trying to be as supportive as i can be without pushing too hard.

4,esbee,09/17/2018,Help! Wedding Stress on Bulimic Friend,"My best friend is getting married next month. She has struggled with bulimia since high school (we are now in our late 20's) but has been doing well the last few years. Once the wedding started to get closer, her bulimia resurfaced. When I encouraged her to seek help, she refused to go back to the therapist that had helped her before because she said she's too busy with wedding planning and therapy is too expensive. As a result, I've watched her tailspin in an awful cycle for the better part of a year. She has latched on to an online fitness influencer that does a lot of ""challenges"". Once a month or so, she'll ask me to do a challenge with her. I'm a pretty healthy person these days, I work out regularly and use flexible dieting to stay in good shape, so I can't bring myself to participate in these challenges, but I have always supported her in what she believes will be best for her. Well, today I just hit a little bit of a breaking point. Her wedding is in just over a month, and she believes that she has to lose a certain amount of weight before the wedding day so she is cutting all sugar, dairy and alcohol (worth noting: these are all the things she binges on) from her diet and forcing herself to do multiple workouts every day. This is not healthy, and I can't stand by and support it. I know that this is just going to result in her going hardcore on this challenge for maybe 3 or 4 days, getting exhausted and stressed, and then having a binge and purging. It's a cycle I know well at this point and I can't bear to see it starting again and just stand by her as she does it. I expressed this concern to her, and practically begged her to focus on moderation and what makes her feel healthy, but she basically told me that her health is something to worry about after the wedding, but right now losing that weight is all that matters. She is very defensive when anyone challenges her on knowing what's best for her health, and I'm worried that not giving her the support she is asking of me may make things a million times worse. At the same time, my conscience is tearing me up about supporting something that I know will just make her condition worse and may end with a hospital visit instead of a happy wedding. I just don't know what to do. Has anyone else been in a similar position? Any suggestions you have will be most welcome.

5,Dark_Twin,01/23/2019,Delirium Thoughts,"I should have discovered this safe place a long time ago. Now it’s too late.
I will write to free my heart.
I would like to write a story. The story of my greatest friendship of which I am guilty of putting an end to it.
I am here writing in a foreign language because I hope someone can learn from my mistakes.What hurts is not knowing. I will never know why she has distanced herself from me.
Was it my fault? Did I do something wrong, as usual?
What was supposed to do? What was expected of me?
Why did everything seem ok to me?I thought if she was felt ill, she would tell me. I was convinced that our friendship was stronger than any disease.
I was always on her side. Always. I protected her or I believed to do it.She was B. I was V.
I want to tell you the story of a friendship lost for my stupidity. How many friendships have been destroyed by love?
Maybe I was looking for her too often. Maybe I hugged her too much. Maybe I hold her too close.Two chaos meet, they get close and then they drift apart.
Yin and Yan, two opposites hug each other with a point of the other within themselves.
She was graceful and kind. I was brave and sassy. The same sensibility has led us to the ocean of pain.
We had two different sufferings, two different mental illness.
I wonder if in the end it was the same face wearing two different masks: depression and anorexia.
When we were together, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. The fire lived in our hug.At a certain point she started to avoid me.
I thought that she didn’t want me anymore, that she replaced me with other new friends.
Now I’ll always wonder for the rest of my life how it would have been different if I had waited a while longer her to open up.
But for me it was impossible to just sit and watch her slipped out of my hands.Don’t make my own mistakes. Regret is a heartrending grief, a litany of tears and nightmares.
Don’t be impatient to see her, to hug her, to protect her and to make her laugh.
Don’t run to see her smile again.I was convinced that if I was right there beside her, nothing could hurt her.
I didn’t understand that evil was already inside her. Even if people didn’t see it.
I used to love her. Even if people didn’t see it.
Now B. is recovering without me and it’s slowly clawing at my soul.Where am I for her? Who am I for her?
I am not among anymore the people that count for her.
I’m no longer a part of her family, although we considered ourselves twins.
I’m not among real friends who have decided to stay with her in all this long and unpleasant journey.I’m a friendship lost.
I’m yesterday. I’m the past to forget. I have never left her. I have always thought of her. She only exists in my mind. Even if people don’t see it.
I lost my whole world, my true love, my heart. Even if people don’t see it.I’m sorry.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,01/27/2019-11:31pm",Concerning Post,"Hi Dark_Twin,Welcome to the NEDA online community forums.

7,maddz,01/15/2019,My friend with bulimia,"My best friend, let’s call her Max has an eating disorder. I noticed something was going on some time ago, maybe two months? But I wasn’t sure and her behaviour was pretty normal so I ignored it(I know I shouldn’t have). Few days ago she told me that she is struggling with bulimia for 6 months already. She said, that she realized that she can’t handle it on her own, so she told her mom about it. At first her mom ignored what she said. When she repeated the same thing, only thing she heard in response was 'don’t exaggerate'. After some time she started the same conversation. Her parents told her to just stop. After few more attempts they told her that for now she will be eating what they will tell her to and she cannot vomit. Today in school she told me almost crying that they don’t  want to send her to a doctor. I’m so sad that she is doing it, but I know she needs professional help. But if her parents say no, her  condition won’t improve. How can I help her? How can I give her support? What she/we can do to convince her parenltd that she’s not just making it up?

8,HelpingAFriend ,12/28/2018,"My friend admitted she has anorexia, then lied and took it back","So one day me and two friends were talking about random stuff when my friend says (with sincerity) “I am anorexic”. She tried to brush past it, and I saw the regret in her face immediately after. It’s not that she didn’t trust us, she’s trusted me for a while, and the other girl for even longer, but she seemed like she didn’t believe herself. The problem with that is, me and the other girl already knew. She has for a while talked about over excersizing, not eating, and fearing weight gain (even though she’s about X pounds underweight already). Nowadays, she will talk in casual conversation about it, admitting that she has an ed. Me and the other girl present also have mental health problems, I especially joke a lot to cope so it’s a thing me and the girl with the ed tend to do on low days, I know it’s not good but I can’t get her to stop without being a hypocrite and I don’t want to stop myself. So she has no problem venting about how “oh I nearly passed out today lol” but the second me and the other girl try to talk seriously about it to see how we can help, she shuts down and starts panicking and saying “nah I’m fineeee you’re being ridiculousssss”. And if she’s not shutting us down she’s mad because we told her that she doesn’t need to worry about the calories in whatever food she’s currently worried about. Are we doing something wrong? Should we forgo her wishes and tell an adult (she’s only 15 after all)? Should we just tell her what’s shes doing is okay? I’m worried that saying anything she doesn’t want to hear will make her more secretive.

9,nameuser,10/04/2018,I just found out my friend is anorexic...,"So I have been worried that my friend may be anorexic for a couple of months now, but these suspicions were only slight and I only see her in the afternoon so I figured she was eating more just when I wasn't there. However we just went on a camping trip and I noticed she barely ate anything. When we got back, I was on my computer and I saw that her google account was still signed in (she borrowed my computer for school) and thinking about the anorexia, I snooped (I feel bad about it). The only document she edited on her google drive was a calendar of sorts labeled with her daily calorie intake and on another page was a bunch of exercises. I have come to the conclusion that she is definitely anorexic. This is VERY BAD and I am VERY WORRIED. She is my best friend. We are both sophomores in high school, but we go to different high schools. I will see her tomorrow at a sailing practice and I'm wondering:1) How do I bring this up to her? I know she will get very mad when she hears I snooped. Very mad.2) Do I wait until tomorrow when I see her and talk to her or do I call her mom or something now?I know that if I talk to her or her parents she will probably stop talking to me (Of course I will still talk to her or her parents).

12,calipeff7,03/04/2018,HELP!,"I'm kind of at a loss where to go at this point. My best friend is suffering from multiple eating disorders within the last year. She was what is considered a healthy weight for her on paper based on her height, but she lost weight quickly. She no longer has a menstrual cycle, and her lab work always came back with not-so-good results. After running a half marathon in October, she began to eat again, but not just eat, binge eat. She now, in just 4 more months, has gained weight again. She is the heaviest she has ever been. Over those 4 months, she was in treatment for a short period of time, but felt it ""didn't help her,"" so she left. Now, she tells me she understands why people commit self-harm. She feels like she is never good enough, she says she has nothing good in her life, and she won't workout anymore because ""there is no point."" I'm truly worried she is going to hurt herself, even though she says she would never. She is almost 24 years old, so I can't walk her into a facility; she has to make these decisions herself. I just don't know what to do at this point. Financially she feels she cannot afford to do a residential treatment stay, or anymore treatment for that matter, but at this point, she needs it more than anything.
