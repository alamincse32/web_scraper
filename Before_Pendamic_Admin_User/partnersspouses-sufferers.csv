My sense is that she knows that much of this stuff has to do with issues regarding her eating disorder, and is beginning to feel a bit backed into a corner with it all.As you said, it may revolve around control as well.   Not so much that she is in control, but the fact that she realizes that she's not really in control of it now.   Which is frequently the sort of realization that brings about reactions like this.   The person has worked so darn hard at restricting, and exerting the terrific discipline that's involved in starving themselves like that, that it can come as a real shock to them when they realize that now they can't stop restricting. even if they wanted to.Which means that rather than being in control, things have moved beyond their control instead. And now their loved ones are expecting them to do something about it, when in the back of their minds they know they can't. People can really find themselves on edge when they find themselves in that position, and that sounds like where she's finding herself now. How she's going to come to terms with this helplessness will be the thing I think.  Finally admitting that there's this huge thing that they are NOT in control of pretty much goes against every single thing they've been working towards.So yeah, the ""coming to terms"" thing.  That sounds like the next step in all of this, and it's really not an easy step to take.

2,nedahelpa,08/08/2019,Naked vs Dressed,"Hello to all.My wife, 52 years young, started on a diet about a year ago, besides that, daily yoga or running or calisthenics, she lost weight and started to look VERY good. However, it got to a point where that was most of what she talked about to anyone who was willing to listen. Daily she was reading more articles on the internet about healthy living, diets, preservatives, tea, etc.She had gone to a nutritionist a year ago and was aiming to improve those numbers. It got to a point where a routine blood test showed Bilirubin in her blood so I
thought she was overdoing it; she decided to go back to the nutritionist and when she came back she waved the results in my face, like a flag of accomplishment. This emboldened her so she continued the Dr. mentioned that a second test showed no bilirubin.HERE IS MY PROBLEM:
  Neither the nutritionist nor her friends that say she looks great have seen her naked. From being slightly overweight..passing through VERY SEXY...now what I see worries me.Sorry for being so blunt!
This change happened in 3 months.We are having problems because I can no longer see her body because it constantly reminds me of that image.
Sex is gone and she noticed it, she is demanding I continue as if nothing changed, she says it's still her. Any ideas on how to deal with this would be appreciated.

3,vauban01,11/03/2019,Wife controls anorexia nervosa with having sex with sb else,"So this might be a bit more complex. Bear with me please, as I'm not a native English speaker.
WARNING: this is only partly about eating disorderMy wife and I have been married for 3 years, but have been together for the five years before in a long-distance-relationship (both from two European countries). She was 19, I was 23 when it started. She's petite and has always been rather slim.
Overall, we both feel very close to each other and have had uncountable great experiences together. Since last fall, we're a family of three and we've also now settled down in my home country. She does speak the language fairly well, but has struggled over the past three years with periods of homesickness and with finding a job. She now has one that makes her quite happy. Our income situation is good, our child is lovely and all the other ""external"" things are improving step by step (house, friendship groups, hobbies, ...).
My wife has been away from home since the age of 13, to a performing arts boarding school. She quit the idea of becoming a performer in some way (or a coach) soon after she'd met me and she's since successfully been to university and now has a degree and said new academic job. Boarding school must have been tough and on several occasions she's shared with me the body and eating struggles she had back then.
During her last year at university (including a job training program), the extreme stress combined with the fear to have to leave her home country in order to finally build a future with me had an impact on her physical and psychological health. She didn't share all of it back then, but she lost weight and struggled. It got better when she came to my country. After our marriage 8 months into her being here, it got worse again.
That's when, as I now know, she met a guy. They met at this language group for immigrants, he's from another European country and has had the same struggles with integrating and adapting to a somewhat ""foreign"" culture. She'd be bubbly and open about whenever they met.
At the time, I was highly stressed in my job. I noticed she'd sometimes struggle getting out of bed and starting her day, she wasn't very successful with finding a job and she also didn't eat a lot, but it wasn't too extreme.
The situation affected me, I connected it to the meetings with this guy and I became suspicious. I finally decided to read her texts and found some suggestive bits that read like a jokey (?) way of flirting. I confronted her. Needless to say she was upset about my spying, but could understand my motives and assured me that nothing had happened. We communicated well and I put my faith in her being honest in the future. As I now know, from this moment on, partly because of this, but also because the other external things didn't get better, she actually started having sex with him. That went on (they only saw each other 4-5 times) for half a year until she decided to stop.
Right after it, we decided to start a family and it immediately worked. During pregnancy, she felt much better, ate plenty and also started a job that made her reasonably content and gave her some structure.
She was worried of postpartum depression, but we worked together to try to avoid it. 1,5 years after she'd stopped having sex with him and when our child was 8 months old (this summer), she ""relapsed"". She knew that breastfeeding would soon be over (and thus a reason to eat regularly), she had a few other challenges coming up and she'd applied to a proper part-time job, which excited her, but also stressed her out (non-native work environment, ...).
After she'd had sex with him again this one more time in June (more details below), she told me the reason our sex life hadn't been what it was in the early years was, in her view, partly due to the fact that she didn't feel a sexual attraction to me anymore. It wasn't accusing, but a very honest and caring confession from her. I am tall and rather slender, but had gained some weight over the last years that showed in some places. It was a massive shock to me, but I decided to do sth against it and have since gone to the gym more often.Now I know that this ""relapse"" triggered what she described as the worst anorexic episode.The summer was difficult. We'd just bought a house, moved in, started renovating, and this ofc added an enormous amount of stress.
She wanted to start treatment. It took some time for the referral, but over the last couple months, she's had her first sessions, which have been productive. Two weeks ago, she told me that her therapist had extended the diagnosis to anorexia nervosa in combination with an addiction and also signs of depression.Also, she hadn't heard from this guy since June and texted him. He gave her some reasons, told her that he'd begun a relationship with a controlling girl (he has his own mental struggles), then told her he wanted to end their friendship/relationship. She told me everything (except the sex), was very distressed about the possible loss of a friend, but also upset about the fact that he didn't really seem to care about her and her current struggles. She'd also just lost her grandfather. She decided to have a final ""goodbye"" meeting because she wanted to completely end this friendship with him. She told me all of this.Now comes the crucial bit:The reasons why I decided to check her texts again was mainly because I felt completely helpless about what to do to help her with her struggles. I did it for myself, but also for the relationship. That is what I told myself.That's how I found out about the 6 months sex relationship with him back in 2017 and the ""relapse"" this June. It seemed to have been more than sex, but in her last texts she talked about how she felt it was a damaging and toxic sort of ""love"" and that she connected it to her eating disorder and her addiction for ""control"" over an aspect of her life: her sex life. When they had sex, it was extremely painful because she closed up, but she didn't tell him. She was shocked that her body showed these signs, because for her, the sex was supposed to be her in control of something. She felt like her body had betrayed her. We talked. It was brutal, but respectful. I was and still am in a dark place. One day later, she told me that because things spiralled down after the last sex/meeting with this guy in June, about four weeks ago, she started having sex with another guy who chatted her up at a cafe. She told me that it was purely sexual and that she did it as a way of remaining in control and to not feel caged with all the struggles that she has atm. She also told me that she and her therapist had discussed all of this just a week ago and that they are currently evaluating whether she doesn't fit into the ""monogamy"" category. Needless to say, I was already damaged enough, so this was just another brutal confession, but what choice did I have?We didn't cancel last weekend's trip, our anniversary weekend trip, but instead tried to use it to talk and start rebuilding.Because I am so worried about her mental health and because I feel like due to therapy, her job and other things currently slowly improving / stabilising, I have to grant her to continue seeing this guy once a week or so. She admits she doesn't know whether it's purely her need of control of dealing with her eating disorder, or also a way of dealing with her only recently discovered non-monogamic desires.It's a complete dilemma for me. The broken trust about what happened in the past is one thing, but I feel like this will eventually be forgivable and something we can leave behind. The combination of me now having to work on myself (body, ...?) in order to appeal attractive to her again combined with having to tolerate her sex meetings because she seems to be in a (temporarily?!) psycho-somatic need of it is just really, really hard. She said that for her sexual intimacy and romantic/relationship intimacy are two not completely, but fairly different things, meaning that she fully and unconditionally loves me and that she doesn't question our relationship one single bit. She was utterly shaken when I honestly told her that since being loyal is such a big thing for me (at least unless both partners are on eye-level and agree on giving each other a bit of ""freedom"" for a while), I was struggling to keep the option of separating out of my head. Over the last few days, we have supported each other whenever the other one had a breakdown: me because of what happened and because of my constant thoughts about what we have now agreed on (and the subsequent feelings of weakness and inferiority that gives me), her because she is so ashamed and guilty of what she's done and how it has affected me. I've always been the calm rock in our relationship, and she's never seen me like this. One more thing: we've both told a good friend, who is impressed at how ""gracefully"" I am handling the situation.We have decided to go to couple's therapy. She ofc is continuing her psychological treatment. She wants to stay above a certain weight because she's still in probation for her new job and because she couldn't endure being stationary and away from her child and me. She wants to consider going stationary when things have settled down a bit, though. I am working on my body and body image, but try to do it in a way where I can say I do it for myself.
She knows she is hurting me a lot with this. I know that if I fully believe her that all of this is true and that it's a life-line for her at the moment, I can't possibly reject her that need without either jeopardizing her health, or our relationship as a whole. It's a dilemma, and we both want to work on it.The extreme amount of love that we show towards each other is making me feel optimistic. The worry about how long this arrangement/situation is going to stay the way it is is making me feel sick. I have asked myself seriously and I could possibly imagine tolerating her having the occasional sex outside of our relationship if OUR sex life, and therefore, to me, our relationship as a whole, is okay again. It DOES have to do with my insecurities, yes, so I feel like that needs to be taken care of before I could possibly give the idea of a partly-open (sex) relationship a thought. I have a strong urge not to tell her this contemplation of mine because I'm still afraid that she might take this as a sign that things aren't as serious as they are. I'm sincerely sorry for going in-depth and into detail. The reason is that I feel that ALL of this matters. It isn't ""just"" an eating disorder. It isn't ""just"" a current lack of physical attraction. It isn't ""just"" her having sex with other men. It's a complex and tangled combination of all of these.I am aware that this board is about eating disorders and not about such a complex multi-facaded issue, but if anything, this text of mine might make some people realise the complexity of eating-disorder-related issues in a marriage. If anyone has any input at all, please do so. As I said, we are going go to to couple's therapy and I might also seek for professional help on my own. I am aware that no community board can replace that.

4,BlueJasmine,10/18/2019,Feeling Helpless & Guilty,"Hello, I am writing as I am confused and I am also needing to organize my thoughts, but also would like some input from fellow people more familiar with this that I am. I met this woman last July and things were electric/karmic I would say. There was an instant attraction and warmth to one another. There was certainly a bond in some same pattern of the past for sure. About 4 weeks into our relationship we were at a restaurant and she had eaten what I seemed to be a bit much, and I could tell her body was not responding well to the situation. She removed herself from the table and went to the bathroom for about 15 minutes. She came back and her body language was completely different and a sense of relief seemed to have come over her, like she was almost high in some way. My instincts kicked in and I was very aware something had shifted in her energy. I thought I wonder if there is something going on her I am not being told about. Sure enough I did some deep research while she was asleep and put all the dots together and thought I think this could be it. Later that night she woke up and we actually broached the subject and she admitted that she has anorexia and bulimia and has been dealing with it since age of 14. She is now 40, almost 41. We continued to date and proceed and I told her I was not sure how to handle all of this or if I could, but I was certainly interested in researching, exploring and assisting if needed and could be done. A few more random dates, a few more trips to the bathroom, one day she did not eat for over 48 hours except some type of food. I started seeing the red flag conductor come out and warn me this is serious and I am not equipped to handle the severity of this. But, I stayed as there is a very serious attraction to her personality and smile etc. There was some more exposure over the next couple of months, but as if about Mid September she just froze up and pulled away. She was back on Match, we got into some difficult communication and bumps in the road and she basically shut this relationship down and was seeking another within 48 hours of a fight. I wrote her a letter suggesting she get help and gave her a resource, found some therapist and have been doing extensive research. However, I feel that I am simply doing the surface work for her and she is not about facing the seriousness of what is going on. I then found out about the end of September that she has been taking medication everyday since she was 15 along side of all of this. It seems she has been prescribed for Narcolepsy. I cannot discount the need for that, but it sure seems a coincidence that it works so well for her eating disorder and that no attempt is being made at alternative choices for a chronic medical condition such as narcolepsy. I am clearly not a Dr, but it seems to fit together to well in her narrative. I am terribly concerned for her. She is very underweight, her body has suffered extreme malnutrition, she has that fine downy hair on her arms and legs, headaches, dizzy, nausea all the time, migraines, and a host of other symptoms that lead to extreme signs of malnutrition. Our relationship has ended, but I ruminate and completely bounce back and forth to letting it go, to extreme guilt. She was lying to me in the relationship about her situation, about other men, and about many things. I can't help but feel guilty, lost and confused as to why she would just up and leave and say no more. When out of her very own lips were the words, I love you, never met anyone like you, want to do this with you, and so much sign of affection while at the same time completely being deceitful, dishonest and hurtful. We don't communicate anymore, and I worry she may simply stay in her realm for the rest of her life and there is nothing I can do. She did say one last thing that she was going to get help but on her terms! That felt to me like an addict saying I can control this and will work it out. One thing I do know is when it comes to mental health is you cannot do your own open heart surgery of if you do it requires some serious tenacity and effort.. Should I just let this go? Is she really in trouble and I just cannot see it? Is she capable of being in a relationship and truly loving someone? I am so confused.. thanks",_admin_moderator,"Fri,10/18/2019-2:20pm",Welcome! ,"Hi! We hope that you’re able to get the support you deserve here on the forums!

5,dittoditto,10/27/2019,Not sure what to do,"My husband has had memory issues since before his ED.  At one point he was gorging until he became obese. Then suddenly he switched to restricting.  We've been complaining to his doctors about his memory issues for 9 years and they are finally listening to us and are sending him to a neurologist and neuropsychologist tomorrow.I suspect that there is an underlying cause for dementia. His father had it and his sister has Alzheimer's.  But I also suspect that malnutrition is also part of the equation.  My husband will not admit to restricting and denies that he is doing anything unhealthy.  It causes a fight if I bring it up, and I have taken the attitude that it is his body and his right to mistreat it, and it is he who will suffer the consequences and I have to give him the dignity to deal with all this himself.  I have my own issues to deal with.So, having said all of this, I was instructed to attend this medical meeting/testing tomorrow.  I know that my husband will not bring up his ED and will deny it if it is brought up.  I have typed up a note outlining the restrictive eating, which I can try to find a way to get to his doctor to read.  What should I do?  Should I let the doctor just focus finding the cause for the dementia?  It is in his family, so this isn't a result of ED.  Or, should I pass the note to someone to get to the doctor which mentions the restrictive eating?  I don't want to bring it up in front of my husband because I don't want to deal with his nastiness any more.  Frankly, even if I bring it up to a doctor, I doubt my husband will do anything about his ED until he is good and ready... if that time should ever come.

7,NCH125,10/18/2019,Fiancee wont admit,"Hey all, first time posting here! Unfortunately I feel like I'm running out of options, time and sanity with this problem. My fiancee won't admit to her ED. I love her to bits, she is my world. We've been together for 3 years and recently got engaged and when things are good, it's the best feeling in the world being with her. But I also know shes bulimic. The signs are all there, she's unnaturally skinny, she snacks a lot and likes to have big portions at meal times, and then always goes to the bathroom after every meal/snack. I have known for a while. I first found out not long into our relationship when we were living in my parents house, where they found a lot of discarded food packages in the bin and when questioned, she admitted it was from her. She then told me in private how she used to be bulimic before she met me but since got over it. She just relapsed this particular day but she insisted she was over it. At the time I was ignorant on the subject so have researched it a lot since. Like I say the signs have all been there but at first I went about it the wrong way, confronting her, following her to the bathroom, we had some huge fights over it. Since then the more I researched, the more I realised this was not the way to help, it's more up to her to face up to it and the day she does, I'll be here to support. But like I say we're now 3 years in and it's the same routine everyday. She eats and snacks, goes to the bathroom to purge, she comes out and I ask if everything is okay, she says yes and then we leave it there. But the problem is it festers inside of me, sometimes I can just leave it because she needs to confront it herself, sometimes I can't help but start asking questions until we end up in a huge fight. The past few weeks it's been okay, up till today when she's gone to work and left her phone at home. I've gone on it to check her emails, simply because there was an online order we needed to sort, but I've gone to her deleted items and found several takeaway receipts on days when I've been at work and shes been at home, and shes told me nothing about these. In fact when I ask what she had for lunch, not in any suspicious way it's just something we do as a couple, she'll tell one thing, but now I'm seeing it's something else. It's by discovering this today that has led me to posting on here now. I don't know how much longer I can cope with this. I suffer from trust issues, I've had terrible relationships in the past. My fiancee knows this, in fact before we started dating she was incredibly helping and understanding when I was having problems with an ex, so she knows all that about me. By knowing she's hiding all this from me is really triggering me. I know I shouldn't take it so personally and the main thing is I just want to help her, I'm absolutely terrified of her doing serious damage to herself. We've planned out whole lives together, talked about having kids in the not so distant future, and I really want to have this life with her. But at the same time I'm struggling with how she's hiding her ED and keep having terrible thoughts of her killing herself from the bulimia. But like I say she won't admit to it so I feel helpless in what to do. I have only come up with two ideas, one being posting on here. Two is speaking to her mother. My fiancee how told me how her mother also used to be bulimic right up until she become pregnant with her, and the doctor told her she needs to stop the bulimia or she'll do serious damage to her baby. So I thought if I confessed to her mother that I worry shes being bulimic maybe she could help, but also worry my fiancee will be mad that I've dragged her mother into something she says is not existent.

8,momliz,10/06/2019,Multiple Family Members with Eating Disorders,"I have been married for 20 years and my husband has always been an exercise enthusiast.  His mother is also, and 10 years ago she admitted to me that she had exercise bulimia. She cited to me several examples of disordered behavior.  When she told me this story she said she is much better now and not to worry that she is healed.  My husband idolizes his mother and credits her for his love of exercise and fitness. When she visits our house, she often times brings her own food, brings a dish to share (that is so gross she is the only one to eat it)or she says she's already eaten and not to worry about her.  When she visits, she, my husband and sometimes his cousin talk about foot constantly. She tells my husband how great he looks and that she's so glad he's eating healthy. They talk about all the different diets to the point where my sister-in-law and I just leave the room.  Family gatherings have become difficult because of everyone's eating preferences and schedules.  About 3 years ago, I brought up my concern with my husband , his mother and my father-in-law because of the impression it was making on our teenage children.  I was berrated for not understanding that they were just trying to be ""healthy"" and that I should just let everyone eat what they want to eat without interfering.  Fast forward to the present, along with my husbands day job, he is also a fitness instructor.  He has lost some noticeable weight.  I voiced my concern to him as gently as I could, but he said he is ""healthy"" and feels great.  I am concerned for him, and now I am concerned for my teenage daughter who has been suffering from panic attacks recently and I see her starting to take on some of the food eating habits exhibited by my husband and his mother and cousin.  I am in the process of finding her a therapist and I don't know what to do about my husband who thinks he is a great example and flaunts his eating and exercise to the kids.  Is he being healthy and I don't see it?  Or does he have a problem?  When he says he's being healthy, I don't know how to counter that.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,10/06/2019-11:38pm",momliz,"Hi momliz, your post has been edited to comply with NEDA’s community guidelines https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/forums/community-guidelines.

9,JohnnyBravo,10/10/2019,"Girlfriend with anorexia nervosa, trying to be as supportive as I possibly can..","So my girlfriend who is the love of my life was diagnosed some time ago with anorexia nervosa. Lately she's been trying to find help and reaching out to counselors and therapists. It seems that she can be very selective who she wants to have as an counselor or therapist and I can understand that. But as much as I try to be there for her, I'm not sure if she's getting the help to appease myself and her family or if it's actually for her. She keeps calorie counts which is common with this disease and she doesn't like to eat that much in one day otherwise she will feel guilty. And even though she may not eat much she doesn't also have severe constipation and she doesn't like to oftenly listen to a doctor's advice on what and how stuff should be treated. This girls the Love of my Life and it hurts me everyday to watch her obsess with her size and guilt tripping herself when she feels she had ate to much. I cook almost everything she eats and count the calories in what I make her, I don't want to feel like I'm enabling her though and I don't know if I am. Some days she eats such a low intake that I become very worrisome. When I ask her why she continues she tells me that she wants to be her best self and look beautiful for me, but I know its a cover or diversion from her real answer because I've told her a couple hundreds of times I don't care about her weight I care about her health. I just hope I can find some advice on this situation currently, sorry to bother anybody but I'm worried she may get worse before she gets better and I need to see her get better before the serious health complications begin.

10,WornOutAndNumbH...,05/05/2019,16 year rollercoaster ride with my 55+ yr old wife with ED,"First time posting here after reading some very helpful posts from guys in similar situations.Can you believe a grandmother of 9 is still struggling with ED? That's my wife.
We've been happily married for almost 35+ years and at age 40 she bought into the lie of EDs.That's when she started dieting and exercising a lot. It was a slow process until one day I realized it was getting extreme. I confronted her about it and she got real defensive. I gave her some literature about ED and she angrily gave it right back to me. Her exercising increased. She withdrew from social and family events because there was food. Thankfully our daughters never went down that path. At one point her wrists and ankles started to swell. She was knocking on death's door. I should have taken her to the hospital right then. She put some weight on for a while but not for long. When I told my wife that other people were asking me if she's okay, that hit her between the eyes, and she started to put on a little weight again. (Probably to hide the obvious from others.) She rode that fine line for many years. Sometimes a little above or below. She became more controlling about simple stuff.She's got hundreds of cookbooks, bakes cookies and bars for me to share at work, and won't ever eat a single one herself. When our whole family goes out to dinner together, she does not eat much. We have never had dinner or lunch at our kid's houses because they know she won't eat what they make. She hasn't seen a doctor in over 8 yrs when she had a bike accident that almost killed her with head injuries. While she was semi-conscious in the hospital, she told me she hated my guts. She doesn't remember anything about her hospital stay.Our grown kids are losing patience with me that I can't get her to seek help. She refuses since her family used to ridicule people who got counseling. A few years ago our pastor asked my wife if she needed help with ED. She has hated him for it ever since.I confronted her 4 weeks ago about losing weight again and pleaded with her to get help or at least get a check up which she hasn't had since her accident. SHE WILL NOT GO! We argued until she didn't have a leg to stand on. I kept the conversation focused on her health. She kept trying to drag in my shortcomings from the past. Finally I wrote her a couple letters since I can get my points across better that way. Since the letters, she has gained XX pounds. And it shows. She has stopped exercising cold turkey! She's reading books instead. Novels.She hasn't talked to me in the last 4 weeks. She is hopping mad at me. If looks could kill.
So today I broke the ice and told her to get it off her chest. She blew up at me and pointed out all my faults to control the conversation, and told me she recovered by herself without help, and said she hated me. Ouch!The gained weight and no exercise for a month is the biggest change she has ever made. She told our daughter she doesn't ever want to go back to that low weight. Now I finally realize why she hates me so much. I'm the biggest threat to the secret lie of ED that hides inside her!! Just like our pastor a few years ago.I want my wife back...and without the lie of ED sitting on her shoulder everyday. It's like a little demon took control of her 16 years ago and she doesn't see it.
I have talked to a great ED counselor a couple times in the last few years but she said my wife needs to make that decision. Well my wife won't listen to me. Is it up to our kids to tell her? Don't know how to proceed from here.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,05/08/2019-12:52pm",Hello! Welcome to NEDA forums,"Hello! Welcome to NEDA forums!

11,idontknowanymore,08/14/2019,I feel so angry and hopeless ,"I feel bad for saying this, but as someone whose girlfriend has an ED I'm angry. I'm almost 19, she's 22 and we have been dating for about 9 months and met 1 year ago. At first I was very patience and calm about it, but a few months ago at the start of the summer things changed. The situation has reached a point where I'm starting to feel so hopeless and angry. We are long distance and see each other very rarely (have only met twice in real life), so I can't really be there physically to do anything to help her. I've noticed that she's most likely getting worse. At first i thought she was getting better since she threw up less often, but I've realized that her ED may just have changed its form. She barely eats and still thinks she's eating too much, today she told me she had fruit for dinner. Then she exercises for at least X hours during the day (despite barely eating). She talks all the time about how she ""needs"" to lose weight and is too fat. As if this wasn't enough, she has a family that definitely makes everything 100% worse by calling her fat and telling her she needs to lose weight. Her mom has an ED as well I'm pretty sure, and my girlfriend (who wasn't and isn't even fat) was put on diets when she was as young as 6 years old. This is what makes me so angry, it feels like no help in the world will help her as long as she lives with them. But she can't move out, partly because she's not ready to live alone (bc of her eating disorder) and because she can't afford it yet. I'm witnessing how she is slowly getting worse. She's dizzy a lot (almost every time we talk on Skype) and sadly she faints several times a week. I keep pushing her to get more help, which she several times has stated that she knows she needs. Sometimes she has told me that she was gonna be put in the ""hospital"" (idk what it's called, english isn't my first language) or PROMISED me to get more help, but then the next day she acts like our conversation never happened. One day she says that she knows she needs more help and is willing to work more, then the next day she to says she's fine. I have gone from being patient and hopeful, to angry and hopeless. It feels like there's nothing at all that I can do anymore, like it is out of my control. I'm so worried about her, I want her to get better. It's affecting our relationship as well, I have to admit. She needs MORE help but won't get it. And then there's her parents that are destroying her. I feel like nothing I do will ever be enough and things never will get better. I don't know what I should do.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,08/14/2019-7:26pm",Welcome! ,"Hi! Thank you for posting.

12,dittoditto,08/02/2019,Things are getting worse,"He is barely eating.He has long periods of confusion.  It's hard to talk to him any more because often he doesn't understand and he asks the same questions over and over again. For instance, we were at a store.  I said ""Mary won't be here to work with us today.""  He said ""who is Mary?""  I said she is the woman we always work with, you know that.""  He said, ""how do you know she won't be here?""  I said, ""today is Wednesday and it is her day off"".  And He said, ""how do you know"". And I said ""she told us."" and he said ""who is she?""   It must have been 15 minutes later that he said: ""Mary won't be here today, it is her day off"" like we hadn't just discussed this, and I just looked at him in shock.I grow terrified by the progression of this because the confusion happens more and more often.  His doctor is sending him to a neurologist.  A neurologist will not deal with his eating disorder.So, I wonder: I don't think people stay in marriages where one person has an eating disorder.  What are the percentages of divorce in these situations?How long can people restrict eating before they become very physically ill, especially if they are Type II diabetic?Is mental confusion a sign that the ED is very advanced?  Do people live much longer after mental confusion sets in?Hi sister has dementia, so I'm not sure what the root cause of this is.  I am very tired of dealing with this. I am tired of his nastiness and lack of mental acuity. There really is no good answer.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,08/06/2019-1:34pm",Medical Signs and Symptoms ,"Hi, dittoditto.

14,dittoditto,06/08/2019,The ED Group,"It was an interesting meeting.  I had thought it would be more like an Al-anon group but it was more a few women coming together every so often to share their stories.  All of them were mothers of children with ED and all the children were now grown and in recovery.  The mothers told stories about how their kids were doing, and we all made encouraging noises, but their wasn't really any sharing of solutions, or even advice for self-help and setting boundaries.It was interesting that even years later the mothers were so traumatized by the whole experience that they continued to worry that a relapse might be caused by common life experiences and they analyzed everything their offspring ate.  It's amazing how whole lives revolve around food with this illness.I don't believe I will go to it again as I was looking more for a program where people share solutions on how to live with this and emotional support.

15,ImConfused12,11/12/2018,Broken up with. So many questions ,"Hi all, I was broken up with with my by my ex who is anorexic and I'm having trouble coping and I was hoping to get some answers to help me understand better.My gf had been struggling with anorexia since her teens, she also was a victim of sexual assault. she always told me even before we dated that she pushes people away and that I wouldn't want her as a girlfriend. Eventually we ended up dating and her anorexia seemed to be relatively under control. Our relationship for the most part was great she would tell me I was the best boyfriend she ever had and that she was so in love with me and everything seemed fine. Well about 2.5 weeks ago she started randomly talking about things in our relationship we needed to fix or we would need to end it, this kind of caught me by surprise since she never mentioned these issues before. So we both had a conversation and spoke about things that were bothering each other and agreed to work on them.  After that things seemed to be great we seemed more in love than ever.So she randomly texts me one night while was out drinking and randomly ends it. I was shocked and devastated.  First she cited that she couldnt get over the things bothering her in our relationship,  then started talking about how this time of year (when her sexual assault happened) that she becomes withdrawn and pushes people away and that right now shes numb and wants to be alone and that she feels she's slipping back into her anorexia and doesn't want to drag me down. Then proceeds to tell me how I can do so much better than her and shes doing me a favor. And we've been broken up since ive been a mess and she just doesnt seem to care even when i reach out to her. I love this girl ive had a hard time dealing with it. I begged her to let me help her and how much i love her but she just keeps saying she needs to be alone and how depressed she is. Im having trouble accepting the end but more importantly im concerned about her health, i love this girl and couldnt live with myself if something happens to her regardless if we're together or not and know nothing about this disease or what to do. I guess what i wanted to ask is..1. Is it normal for people with this disease push people away when they get too close? 2. Is there anything i could of done to prevent this? Did i not make her feel wanted enough?3. What should i do moving forward? I want to help her and be there for her but she says she needs to figure it out on her own. Its so hard to sit back and do nothing, but i want to respect her wishes at the same time, this time last month we were talking about being together forever and one month later its over and she seems like a completely different person. Sorry about the long post. Im just not sure what to do any more.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,11/16/2018-1:03pm",Resources ,"Thank you so much for sharing.

16,Anonymous452,07/14/2019,Gf broke up with me and gave me an ultimatum ,Hey guys this is my first time doing this sort of thing but lately I’ve been confused on whether what I’m doing is right or somewhat wrong. I’ve been with my girlfriend for about 3 years and have known about her ED from the beginning. We broke up about a year ago but found our way back to each other. Except this time I had lost some weight of weight and not ate as much as I used to before. She’s mentioned it a few times that I needed to eat more than usual and has gotten angry about it. About three weeks ago she was institutionalized at the hospital and recently was let out. She came over to my house and we got intimate afterwards the topic of food came up and she suddenly got really upset. I took her home and unwilling to talk to me she later texted me saying she needed a break from us. We ended up talking about it the next day and proceeded to tell me that she is letting me go because i trigger her because of my weight loss and eating habits. She tells me that she wants nothing to do with me and will not get back together with me unless I gain weight and look how I used to before. I’m motivated to gain weight and all but I have this feeling that maybe I shouldn’t go back to her and that doing this is irrational. I love her and I want to be with her but I can’t help to think this is a weird ultimatum and that her ED has gotten much worse than before and that I’m possibly making it worse.

17,Somewhatok,05/30/2019,I feel like I'm losing my mind,"I've never been here. I didnt even know this website existed. I will first apologize if I seem uneducated on any of this as I pretty much am. I've been scouring the web trying to learn and understand as much as I can as fast as I can. 2 days ago I found out that my girlfriend has been hiding her anorexia from me for 8 months. The conversation wasnt an easy one. We were up all night and into the next day. She has been feeling really crappy the past couple months and I've been doing what I can (google) to figure out what could be causing her to feel this way. I was convinced I'd figured it out when I found nondiabetic hypoglycemia. She wasnt so sure. I kept digging and I know her eating habits arent the best so when I found something that mentioned anorexia I thought hmm.. maybe she isn't eating enough and that's causing it. I NEVER thought she'd be showing me a few hours later her calorie counting app with the limit set to X which she was barely ever reaching. For days she would restrict and then binge on (a healthy amount of calories for and adult woman) and then repeat the cycle. We've had A LOT going on the past couple months. Her father (55) passed away suddenly from heart issues that happen to run in the family. We took him to the hospital and he died hours later. It was the most pain I've ever seen someone in. My girlfriend is only 21. Her mother, a real stand up lady, isn't in her life. She'd rather do drugs. She was now an orphan. She has a 2 year old daughter that we both take care of during the week and her daughters father takes her on the weekends. Lately her health has been absolute sh*t. Her heart rate will increase to like 120 to 135 for no reason. She will complain that her chest feels tight. She'll tell me she doesnt take normal deep breaths. She has headaches. Shes dizzy. Shes irratable all the time. She cant get out of bed in the mornings. All of these things worried me because of what we just went through with her dad and the history in her family of heart issues. I urged her to get things checked but she always refused. Now it all makes sense. I'm scared. I cried. Sobbed to her when I found out. I know that's not a good reaction. I know I should have been stronger but I'm so scared. I'm frustrated that shes just been living with these issues and knowing full well why. In a way I have some anger that she let me wonder what was happening. That she knew but continued to knowingly push her body to this point. I told her if she continues she will die. I dont know if that's too drastic to say but it's literally the truth. This disease takes so many. Although I'm hurt and angry inside I cant show that to her. I know it's not really her doing this to herself. I know it's not her fault. Yesterday I made an appointment with a cardiologist. I called probably 10 places till I found one that could get her in, in 2 days. I screamed into my pillow halfway through because I was so stressed. I feel guilty for even thinking about myself because I'm not the one who needs any attention. She won't see a therapist or anyone who will help her with her anorexia. Which, from what I understand, is really important if she ever wants to recover. You cant treat the disorder if you dont address what is causing it.. I feel like if she starts eating healthier she will just become more unhappy as she isn't controlling that aspect and continues to see herself in a negative light. When she talks about it with me she often gets frustrated saying ""you dont get it never mind"" I feel like she thinks this is something that only she will ever understand and that its ""her thing"" or like shes special in that way. It bothers me because I'm sure her reasoning and underlying causes may differ from others but at the root of it all she has an ED and other people do as well and it's not special. She told me yesterday that if she goes to the cardiologist and everything is fine she will probably just keep doing what shes doing. This set me off. How can she know what she knows, read what she reads, see ALL THE FACTS and still want to do it. I see things as black and white. You do this and die. Maybe tomorrow, maybe next week, maybe next year, maybe 10. Is your whole life really worth that?? I know it's not this simple but her life isn't just her own she has a daughter. I dont know how to talk to her because I know I dont do it right anymore. I'm already horrible with communicating. I struggle with anxiety, depression and adhd and this makes things difficult for me. ""I can make all the appointments in the world, I can struggle over every word I say, but none of it means anything if you arent willing to help yourself as well. I cant sit here and watch you kill yourself over this."" I told her this. I shouldn't have. I made it seem like an ultimatum but I know I cant do that. She asked if I was saying I'd leave her if she didnt stop. I said I couldnt because I know if I made that ultimatum she couldnt hold true and I'd have to. I said that her ED meant more to her than I did. She said no. This whole conversation shouldn't have happened. I feel like I messed it all up. Shes so defense about everything if I say anything in the wrong tone the whole energy shifts and we will be arguing about something soon. It's not even about her ED just anything. I walk on eggshells. Then once I've apologized, because I want to make peace, because I want to be normal again, she will come back later and say shes sorry. It's a never ending cycle. I know it isn't her. Lately shes been trying to justify herself and prove to me shes not in any physical trouble. She uses her bingeing to say that her body must be fine she gets nutrients. (Idk if that is true but I know her eating patterns arent okay and I know her heart issues and other signs arent normal) She tries to tell me its anxiety and stress. It's the cigarettes making her breathe weird. Its dehydration messing with her heart. Shes on her phone nonstop searching things trying to prove shes really fine. It sucks because I dont know enough about the human body or EDs to properly respond.Lately she stays in bed long after I wake up and take care of her 2 year old (I love her toddler. I take care of and love her as my own but when she is doing less and less to help out and I'm carrying so many stresses it's taking a toll. I'm doing all the mom things, I'm on the ED research, I'm waiting on her as well as our 2 year old and I'm drained as hell. When the toddler goes to sleep I continue to do whatever my girlfriend needs and I go to bed wishing I did half of something for myself that day.)I want the girl I fell in love with. I dont want to wonder if I can joke around and have a good day today or if I should shut my mouth and see how to act. I constantly miss her even when shes here. I'm starving for her attention and love. I will do anything for her. I will help her and care for her and do whatever I have to but I want to win this. I want to get through.

18,Eli173,04/26/2019,Wife admitted to ED,"I just today found out my wife has Bulimia. She had started strict dieting and extreme exercise about 8 years ago and she started to really lose weight. She would cook meals for the family but then count calories and weigh out every little portion of food. This went on for years and then she had a couple of fainting spells and after that she seemed to get a little better. Clueless me just chalked her fainting spells up to her not eating right and exhaustion. Then she started to slide back into her old ways and it suddenly clicked for me. I started thinking back and I couldn’t believe I never realized that I completely ignored the signs. Fast forward to today, I finally had to talk to her about it for my own sanity as I deal with depression and anxiety as well and it was literally eating away at me. When I told her of my concerns she came right out and admitted it to me. She said that she was really wanting to tell me or hoping that I would figure it out. She also says that she is done living that way and is going to be completely open about it to me but she really doesn’t want to seek professional help. Now I am terrified that she will really try to hide it from me and continue to binge and purge and stay in that vicious cycle.

I've talked about the councilling and how thats good idea. I mentioned the eating disorder which she fluffed off.

20,Greenfrog87,02/23/2019,Scared and Hurt,"Hi all. I'm new here but I need some help.
About 6 months ago I fell in love with the most wonderful person I think I will ever meet and he he had baggage but it didn't scare me.
A couple years ago, he developed AN in a suicide ward. He struggled for a while but eventually got weight restored and could function just fine but he never actually dealt with the mental side of things as he 'recovered' by trying to stay in a good mood during the day and binged at night.
About a month ago, he started to eat less but I thought it was nothing (I didn't even know he struggled with an ed at the time). Two weeks later, he had cut cals so much so quickly that when he had an anxiety attack at the same time as a low blood sugar episode, he over-treated it and was unable to move, had postural low blood pressure. He was diagnosed with refeeding syndrome and not allowed to leave until he was better. It was horrible to see. After the ng tube was removed, he was placed on a certain amount of calories which was extremely difficult for him for obvious reasons but he wasn't even underweight. Less than a week later, they finally released him from the mental health act so that he could go home since they didn't have any beds in the MH ward.
Coming out of hospital, to begin with, he was fairly okay. He was able to eat all his 'safe' foods and was on what would be an extreme diet for most but a huge improvement for him. This fairly quickly changed however as he restricted to a certain amount of his BMR as safe foods became unsafe over the following weeks. He had told me multiple times that he didn't want to improve because he couldn't so there was no point in trying. It was easier to give in.
I, of course, was terrified and developed near-constant anxiety as I was triggered by so many things. I began to develop AN and thought that googling stuff would help when I was anxious (spoiler alert, it made my anxiety far worse). This continued for a couple weeks (that felt like a year) until he finally opened up to me about how much it sucks to have an ed. He's tired all the time, easily agitated, hates his body and can't think straight. I was so glad to hear him talk to me, finally, about things. This whole time, he wouldn't be able to talk to me about any of it. He would just shut down and I would just have to shut my mouth or it would upset him more. Following him opening up to me, I realised how important it was for me to recover so I began to. My (initially forced) increased mood and aversion to talking about anything to do with it improved his mood to the point where he expressed how much he actually does want to recover but it's so difficult. He also deleted his calorie counting app, removed locks on his phone and said he'd increase. He says that he gets this extreme nausea and anxiety when he tries to eat anything he's not 100% with and how impossible it is to force himself through that.
Unfortunately/fortunately, his metabolism is not new to this kind of restricting. He's not overly weak, his heart isnt beating too fast or too slow, he's sleeping okay and hasn't had any of the more concerning symptoms such as fainting. He's definitely much skinnier but he said it's really frustrating because he can't lose weight as fast as he wants to while not being tachycardic or constantly exhausted and depressed/angry.
Will all that said, I genuinely believe he has the potential to decide that life is worth living properly (since he's starting uni soon and is looking forward to our life together) and begin recovery in some way. Due to this and his intense fear and anxiety with hospitals in general let alone an ed ward, I think putting him in patient should be a last resort.
With context, here's some questions.
1: When is enough enough? I know his body is eating it's self but I still think he can and had time to improve but I don't want him to die or have irreparable damage done (people struggle for years with this, right?) But I don't know when to make that final decision to have him admitted. Are there any big red flags I should watch for in his behaviour that would mean he's gone/about to go too far?
2:  He says that when he's using other unhealthy coping mechanisms, he has very little anxiety and a genuine appetite. I know it's not sustainable but I thought it to be a lesser evil considering it's not like he'd eat if he wasn't using. Is this normal or even helpful?
3: He explained to me how much guilt and shame he feels about effecting me so much. He's expressed when he's distressed that he wants to live alone because then I wouldn't be triggered by him and he would feel less guilty about putting more on me. The thought terrified me to begin with (and still does) but could that actually help anything? I fear he'll sink into a rut of depression and loneliness as he gives in and lets his ed progress back to what it was when it nearly killed him the first time but they do say distance makes the heart grow stronger.
4: what are some things I can do to help me? I'm already meditating more (which is helping with how reactive and emotional I get when triggered), I'm seeing a therapist more, I'm talking to friends more, reminding myself that he is genuinely generally happy, writing my feelings and thoughts down. I am doing all the right things but it's so exhausting. I just have this constant and ongoing fear and anxiety in my chest that I'm watching him die and not doing anything about it even though I'm doing everything I can.I have never thought I could be so perfect for someone let alone that someone could be so perfect for me and I'm terrified of losing him.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,02/24/2019-5:19pm",Post Edited,"Hi Greenfrog87, We are glad to hear that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

21,JJ-letsdoit,01/21/2019,new-here-newly-married,"Hi all, I met my wife about 2 years ago and while dating she confessed to me that she has bullimia.
We are both in our mid 50s and she has ED (we call it like that) since she was about 17 years old.
She also confessed to me that she still very often binge and purge.
Of course one of the 1st things I’ve done is to, after reinsuring her that I do love her and i do want to spend the rest of my life with her, read about bullimia and educate myself a lot.
We have a long distance relationship, it’s about a 5 h away door to door and she has 3 teenage kids at home, I don’t have a kid. We got engaged and got married with her parents blessing, but many people on her side know about it because of some other issues going on.
During these last 2 years, she often distanced herself from me telling me how unperfect she is and how i desserve someone “normal” because I’m a normal guy, but we generally resolve it talking. One of the underlying issues, is that she is terrified to lose me, because of all the associated weights with her life and the ED and she often thinks that it is too much for me and that she does not desserve me. My response is always the same and it’s we will work on a better future together. Of course i studied ED recovery and read many many articles and forums and came across some studies and books.
We eventually talked about it and she agreed to work toward recovery with me trying structured eating, in parallel i looked for an ED recovery center and called some and eventually got her an appointment, few months from now. However, lately she has been under more stress and deeply feel sad about not being the best wife for me and this is something that she thinks often and often and is gaining some traction. I’m trying to help her the best i can and truly want her to recover from ED because i know that many aspects of her life will fall in place after recovery.
We both know that recovery will be slow and full of bumps and maybe relapses but we also know that this is the best possible direction. I’m afraid that she is still too afraid about a new life, because after all she is pretty comfy with ED, yet suffers a lot from it. Any advices will be like super helpful, maybe there is something i can’t see maybe someone went through a smiliar story, of course i know all stories are different but i also know from reading that there are so many aspects of ED that are carried across all with ED, after all, it is possible that common causes will generate common effects, i need to find ways for my wife to have a better life, best with me of course.

22,Wthomps429,01/08/2019,"Is there an acceptable level of purging, and health effects?","My fiance has had an eating disorder since she was 16. She has been on medication since she was 17 as treatment for it. She is 48 now and at a healthy weight, but still purges every week. She also works out a lot and the purging gets much worse when she doesn't. She's always connected the ED with exercise and is honest (mostly) with me when I ask her about the purging. My concern is that this amount of purging seems to be acceptable to her, but I worry about the health affects. She's frequently clearing her throat and that's usually a tell that the purging is worse. She coughs a lot, too. Is there an acceptable level of purging for someone with a long term eating disorder? Ironically, her sister is a psychologist specializing in eating disorders and doesn't seem too alarmed when I've asked her about it, except to say that she should adjust her meds, so I haven't pushed getting help.

23,Michael104,01/02/2019,New Member - Wife with EDs,"Happy New Year all. I have just joined this forum seeking help, tips, advice as my wife is struggling with EDs. We met nearly 8 years ago (this month). I was vacationing with friends in Costa Rica and she had been living there for 3 years (originally from the US about 30 min from where I’m from). We hit it off the night we met at a sports bar watching the NFL playoffs. We kept in touch and ultimately began a long-distance relationship before she decided to move back to the states and move in with me 8 months later.  I was thrilled, her family was thrilled and it was a really exciting time for everyone, especially the two of us.Over the 8 months of our long-distance relationship, I traveled to Costa Rica a few times and spent a week with her. Back then I wasn’t aware of her EDs. When we began living together I didn’t know right away until she was binging in front of me then told me. I was certainly surprised, but not upset with her at all and frantically began reading about eating disorders. I knew it upset her whenever the topic came up, so it was avoided like the plague. I’ve tried to support her in ways that make her feel loved and not alone. We got engaged 6 years ago and either just before or after she starting to seek help. She went to a specialist/coach for a few months and had a binder she was using. I didn’t want to upset her, so whenever she felt like sharing any details with me, I would listen. Unfortunately, we moved to another state and it was too far to continue going back to the specialist and she said there wasn’t anyone like that near where we were moving to. I took her word for it and never tried to look into it to help as I’ve always tried to be sensitive to her feelings on the matter.We have been married for over 4 years now and have been talking about starting a family, but I’m clearly concerned for her health and want to make sure she addresses her EDs. We’ve both been really busy at work (she started a new job) and is working longer hours. We have been fighting more frequently over the past couple of months and we both got things off our chest. I told her I was concerned for her well being along with the desire but fear of trying to have a baby. She told me her friend had referred her to someone for help, but was vague. As always I didn’t question it. All these years have gone by and I have allowed her to continue with her EDs “waiting” for the right time to address it when she is ready.  Christmas Day we got into a huge fight and she left my family’s place to spend the night with her parents. The next day she came home to pack up things and spent two nights at a hotel. Now she is at her friend’s apartment while she’s moving out of it this month. She’s there alone.We have barely had any contact since last week. On NYE, she texted me wishing a good night and wanted to speak New Year’s Day. I didn’t hear from her until she texted she was on her way over which I wasn’t expecting. She came home and told me how she was feeling hurt and angry over things said on Xmas day, but also how she feels alone at home if I fall asleep on the sofa. *Our bedroom is upstairs and we have two bathrooms. She goes upstairs after dinner or eating late to purge and shower before, so instead of confronting her I sleep on the sofa then will eventually wake up and go to bed.* More importantly, she told me she signed up for an online program and was going to have books sent home. I told her I was glad she was doing that and that I myself have been looking into getting help. I’ve realized that there never is a right time and now need to finally do something to learn how to better support my wife. I’m proud she is starting program, but she said she can’t be home, packed up more things and went back to her friend’s apartment. She has about 10 days left before her friend has to completely move out and I don’t want her to feel like she needs to continue to stay away from me. I want to learn how to support her the right way. I’m really just beginning this new journey, so any tips, advice, feedback, etc. would be appreciated.Thank you!

24,bagnja1,12/27/2018,Helpless,"Hello,I hope everyone is doing well.I have read through a few posts, and I am sorry for being repetitive by asking probably the same questions as someone else, but it always feels better when you get a response to your own issues. Especially since everyone has a different story.My wife has struggled with her image since she was a toddler. She told me that even as a kid she didn't like the way she looked. Along with that she has suffered with extreme social anxiety since birth. She does not function well in public and when at work she has to fake being who she is to succeed. When she was 13, she started purging and limiting food intake. We started dating at 18 and she told me about the eating disorder around 19. We are now both 32 years old.Over the years I have done more and more research, and found that as she gets older her body is going to more than likely fail. This worries me because she is my soul mate. Divorce to me is not an option, because I love her so much. This one issue is pretty much all we ever fight about.As far as what I have done to try to help. I probably haven't been the best support, to be honest. I started off by chastising and fussing at her once I found out. This is due to my own moral compass issues where I get probably a little too angry when people lie to me. So, when she lied to me about it or she actually purged I would raise my voice and just make her feel bad. At the time I felt she was being selfish and she didn't care. On top of that she has promised to go to therapy for years but has never gone. She states that she gets major anxiety having to find a doctor to go to, and doesn't like being rejected. She said that she has reached out but the doctor either wasn't a good fit or they were full.Now I know the way I acted above is not good. It's wrong. I did wrong. Recently, she has been opening up to me about her disorder. She has had no traumatic event. She says that she is the way she is and she has grown accustom to it. She wants me to talk with her about it, but I don't know how to help her. I do not know what to say. My question: What should I say to help her through dark times? I can definitely tell that she is in a phase of binging and purging. I caught her and it opened the flood gates and this is what triggered me to really change tactics. She keeps putting off a therapist; so i need help with how to get her to go.Please help,JB",_admin_moderator,"Thu,12/27/2018-1:34pm","Hello bagnja1, and welcome to","Hello bagnja1, and welcome to the forums.

25,shanem,02/26/2018,Heart-broken and frustrated.,"Today has been one of those days. I feel like I have completely blown it. My wife was doing so much better and now here we are, she snuck around behind my back and exercised for six weeks. After she was discovered, I had her come with me to the gym in some foolish attempt to teach her some moderation. When I saw that wasn't working, I became demotivated to continue on this same path. Now she's not working out at all, or at least I don't think she is. She's constantly in pain and yet she still won't eat. I can't force her to eat and any attempt to convince her that this is what she needs is met with dismissal, rejection or flat-out bullying behavior. I'm so tired. I don't know what to do. I don't trust her right now. Which is weird because I've always trusted her. Everything I say to her causes her to be defensive and it doesn't even have to be about ED. She has now taken to belittling me and I swear it almost seems like some sort of preemptive counter-strike that is aimed at clipping the wings of my resolve before I can interject something about her situation. I just want my wife to live and I want her to be happy, but this isn't happiness. She's miserable and she's killing me, our marriage, our home and she is going to mess around and put herself in danger if she doesn't quit heading down this path. She's become something I don't recognize. I'm scared. We've been married for almost 17 years and this has been apart of our marriage the entire time. I've been no saint. I've coped in some really negative ways in the past, but I am not that man any longer. Haven't been in years. I'm about to turn 40 and she turned 40 last year. She's been dealing with ED since she was 16.

The past week I started to talk and meet with her so we started to talk about a weight reduction plan and diet and so on, but I was not aware that she was being affected for bulimia yet, so I told her about a plan that I'm doing with the one I lost more than X pounds in a year with little to no changes in my life so she was amazed with it, and today she told me that she was trying to lose weight due to my advice (I did not adviced her, just told her my story) so she started a diet plan and it sent her directly to relapse with Bulimia, to the point that last night she started to vomited blood, and she had started to eat as a crazy (binge) and purge X times a day... To make it worse she works as waitress in a Marriot restaurant so there she can eat as much as she wants to, so she can't stop and is beggining to have problems with their job due to that she is going a lot to the bathroom so her boss is starting to think that she is avoiding her job and she does not wants to tell them about his disease for fear to be fired off. So my question is, how can I start to help her? We have not money right now to pay for professional help, but I can't wait a second to start helping her, so please help me to know where to start, what exercises can she start doing at least to start recovery (don't purge herself). I know a lot about addictions, I'm coach and activist for pornography and sex addiction, so I know a lot about behavioral and substance addictions, but Bulimia is something new for me, so please guide me to help her. Where does Bulimia starts in life? For chilhood neglected, traumas, social anxiety? Some Kindle or ebooks that could be helpful to read? In the meanwhile I would read as much as I can this website, and forum, also I will suggest her some exercises we do with sex addictions to set up boundaries and start loving oneself. Your help would be fully appreciated, thank you so much!",_admin_moderator,"Mon,12/03/2018-1:43pm",Medical Signs and Symptoms ,"Hello. We're sorry to hear about what's going on with your partner.

27,likethebird,11/10/2018,am I doing this right?,"My girlfriend and I are both women and 21. We have been dating for two years, and she has been open with me about her disorder for as long as I've known her. I have been pushing her for recovery this whole time and I think now it's finally a possibility. However, I have watched her attempt recovery before and fail because of lack of support. We have no family that we're on speaking terms with, few friends, and we live paycheck to paycheck with no insurance and no wiggle room for therapy. It's just her and me.She is completely controlled by the disorder at this point and simply is not able to change her thoughts, behaviors and habits on her own even though she wants to. She is (understandably) terrified of recovery but trying her best. She needs help, but there just isn't any besides me I am her only support and am finding myself playing her therapist and nutritionist as well as lover and best friend. I know you're not supposed to do that but there isn't any advice for when other options aren't available. I'm overwhelmed and scared of what will happen to her and to me if I fail.I've promised her I won't leave her because of this and I intend to keep that promise. We are currently working together to find self-worth and confidence for both of us, and I have her writing down disordered thoughts so that she can learn to tell the difference between disordered thoughts and healthy ones. I don't know if either of these things are the right thing to do, but I also don't know what else to try.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,11/12/2018-1:56pm",Free and Low Cost Support,"Hi likethebird,We're glad that you're aware of your partner's disordered eating and want to help her make healthy changes.

28,dangerousBlues,11/07/2018,Partner refuses to get help and I'm scared for her life,"I'm having a hard time writing this because it's upsetting me to even talk about it anymore but at the same time I feel like screaming. I (19, f) met my girlfriend (19,f) a little under a year ago in a class we shared at our community college. We've been together since then, and I've always known about her eating disorder-it was never a revelation or her confessing to me. From the beginning, I knew that certain places were to be avoided when we went out to eat, etc, and that she had meticulous behaviors that revolved around food and eating. Obviously, as we've been together, I've learned more about her disorder. She has been suffering from disordered thoughts surrounding food and body dysmorphia since she was 11 or 12, she started restricting a few years after that and when she was 17 she began restricting heavily. On the daily, she generally refuses to eat a low number of calories a day, and sometimes she will fast. When I met her, she told me she was attempting some form of recovery-she had had a ""wake up call"" in the form of a doctor's visit after she didn't get her period for over 6 months. They tried to take blood but she hadn't eaten anything for days before the appointment, and as a result she passed out, seized, and then vomited and they weren't able to do labs. This was about a year ago, and it made her want to get better for a while, or at least try to. When I met her, I think she was already on the downward slope, and she says its worse now than it has ever been. She has heart palpitations, sharp pains in her chest and ribs, sharp pains in her limbs, she gets dizzy and nauseous, she can't walk up stairs without nearly passing out, and most recently after fasting, she woke up one morning and had a serious bout of vomiting. She is an adult, and refuses treatment adamantly. Her mother and I took her to Urgent Care 2 weeks ago at about 1 am, because of the heart things that were going on. The doctor barely looked at her, said ""well you look fine, you look hydrated"" and left for 30 minutes. He didn't come back, so we just left. The doctor's reaction made her feel like she isn't ""sick enough,"" even though she is VISIBLY underweight. Last week we took her back to the same doctor she first went to about her period last year, and after doing some tests they determined that she is, in fact, underweight (they didn't tell us or her her weight, and didn't write it down which she appreciated) and her heart is slowing down. The doctor then told her to come back in a week (which fell today) and gave her an assessment packet from the local eating disorder clinic. Since then, the two of us have had numerous arguments about this. Our only disagreements or fights to date have been about her eating disorder, and her refusal to get help. She feels like her mom and I are forcing her into treatment, into doctor's tests and the like. I KNOW that you can't force someone to recover, but the doctor told us all that right now it's critical. She's doing serious and permanent damage to her body and she knows this but can't bring herself to seek help. She feels she's not sick enough, and refuses to seek help until she reaches her ""goal weight."" she reached her original GW months ago, and moves it down each time. The doctor flat out told her she will die before she reaches this one. I know she's mad at her mother and I, and I know she feels weird about the openness with which her family is finally talking about this. Yesterday night, Her mom, mom's boyfriend, brother and I went to a ""family night"" at the clinic to learn how to better support her. It was geared mostly at people who had a loved one in recovery, or at least starting to recover. My girlfriend isn't close. She feels as if she can't, and I have seen how much she suffers. She has panic attacks every time she eats, she feels the need to purge constantly (although she hasn't done that in about a year,) she exercises obsessively and it's frankly terrifying how thin she's getting. The worst thing is she can't see that, no matter how obsessively she performs body checks, her brain makes her see herself entirely differently. This is long, and there's so much more, and it's breaking my heart how much this is hurting her because I truly do intend to spend the rest of my life with her. I can't express how scary this is to me and how upsetting it is without causing her to feel guilt, which is not my intention at all. She feels she is being forced, or guilted, or unwillingly put into recovery before she is ready but if she doesn't seek help soon she could die. I'm terrified. I want to support her, I am there for her as much as I possibly can be, but I work and am in school (she is taking time off school,) so that's a lot of time she feels isolated and alone. During this time, she watches toxic movies that she KNOWS will trigger her (to the bone, similar movies) she scrolls through ""thinspo,"" she does anything she can to purposely trigger herself. Her brain twists everything I say or do to mean that I don't like her, or want to be with her. No matter how many times I repeat it, if I do something like fall asleep when we are watching a movie when I get off work, or even when I don't think I HAVE done anything, she gets so so upset. Of course I would never blame her for this, I know it's not HER. but at the same time, It's so hurtful. I feel absolutely helpless, I feel like I am standing around watching her kill herself, and when I do anything else she feels like she can't trust me anymore. I'm scared to lose her and I don't know what to do. I just want to beg someone to help, anyone, I'm not even religious but I've prayed for it. I'm desperate. I don't know what to do. I would do anything for this girl, I just have no idea what she needs.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,11/08/2018-12:44pm",Hello and welcome to the,"Hello and welcome to the forums dangerousBlues.

29,Helpforafriend,10/16/2018,Sorry to have to ask this...,"I don't mean to be at all insensitive, so please don't take this as such. I have a friend who has been suffering from anorexia for many years. She has two small children. I know this is nor unique, unfortunately, but she denies the existence of a problem and refuses help. Her husband is in denial, constantly making excuses that she has been feeding him for years, excuses such as ""She has had two kids, so her doctor's would have said if she was really in danger,"" to"" people are just jealous of her,"" to""well she survived this long so she will be fine.""I, as well as many others in our community, fear that her death with me sooner than later, so here is my ask; I am looking for a widower who has lost his wife who has young  children. We feel that the only way to get her husband to wake up is to find someone who has gone to the end of the line and is in a similar life position. We fear that if we find someone who has lost a teenager, or a spouse who doesn't have kids, that her husband will justify the lack of reality based on the difference in life styles. We feel that he needs to reach her because she is too far gone to get help. Her husband needs to be the wake up call, and she is the dominant force in the relationship, so he, essentially, needs to be scared straight in order to help.

30,mdkz137,09/21/2018,New Here ,"I'm new here, my therapist recommended finding a support group for caretakers and thankfully the National Eating Disorder helpline referred me here as an option.  And forewarning I'm just venting here right now.My wife has an ED (Bulimia, I think?) and now that the ED is out in the open and she's being treated for it it's a blessing, because that's great she's at least seeing professionals about it.  But I'm going to be really honest here.  Watching her binge eat, then purge, then binge eat again, then purge, sometimes 2-3 times in a single evening.... It's hard to say but it kind of grosses me out.  I go from starving to not hungry at all as soon as I see her start.  It's in her whole attitude, it's impossible to describe.  And every time I use the toilet to see even just hints of evidence of the purging. This just like really sets off my thoughts of it especially when I clean the bathroom every weekend and because of the frequency of purging it always looks disgusting.  I need to talk to her about this but I'm afraid of how to approach it in a way that won't trigger her.I feel guilty with feeling frustrated and frankly a bit disgusted by it because it's a disorder and I don't like the thought of making myself the victim, I want to help.  But there's ... nothing I can do for her it feels like. But lately I've begun to notice that I was coping in negative ways.  I was spending more than I should on a hobby that I could focus my free time on, because by focusing on the hobby I wasn't fixating on the eating disorder.  Which then creates more stress in the house and exacerbates everything.  Additionally in order to avoid facing *my* spending habits I was ignoring hers, and in 2 weeks she went through almost $1,000 of food.  Some of that was going out with friends which social interaction is good for her, but a lot of that was grocery shopping and buying a ton of easily bingeable food for home.  We shouldn't be spending even half that for 2 adults and a toddler in the home.  But her go to is to go grocery shopping.  It's like everything she does circles back to food.  everything.  I went to a therapy session with her (her therapist) and that helped in some ways but we didn't actually talk about the ED at all, and that's the main thing I had questions and concerns about.  But it's not my therapy so I didn't want to intrude...I talked to my therapist about it and a few things she's said are helping me come to terms:
1) It's a marathon, not a race.
2) The eating disorder is the tip of the iceberg, it's what you can see, but there's so many factors going into what's causing it.
3) Focus less on the eating disorder which you can't change, and focus more on the environmental triggers that lead her to the eating disorder behavior to see if affecting the environmental triggers helps.
4) ED's are commonly a way to get 'control' (this was just something that helped me understand)This is one long rant that's been sitting with me for a while so I apologize.",_admin_moderator,"Sat,09/22/2018-3:39pm",Edited Post,"We are glad that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

31,JayWeb26,07/30/2018,I don't know what to do. I want to help.,"My girlfriend of 2 years has anorexia and i've been trying to help but i now realize i have no idea how to help her and things are getting worse and i think im making them worse. Im very concerned about her and i want to help. i'm not very good with these kinds of things (i'm not even very good at talking about emotions in general) so i came here because nothing i do seems to be working. it has gotten to the point that i'm very concerned for her health and wellbeing. Every time i vocalize these concerns and ask how i can help she minimalizes her disorder (she says she doesn't even have a disorder, it's not a big deal, etc.) and says i shouldn't waste my time worrying about her. Shes told me many times that she doesn't want to get better. She thinks the only way she can be happy is if she continues doing this to herself. I've tried to get her to see professionals and she said she'd try but that was so long ago and it's so much harder because she is a minor and still lives with her parents who don't seem to care, and not only that they won't let her see me. I also want to see her happy but if this is truly the only way she can be happy i dont think i can take it. any help or advice would be truly appreciated. i don't know what to do anymore, but there's not a chance i'll ever give up on her.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,08/20/2018-4:23pm",Lifeline & NEDA Resources,"Hi JayWeb26, we are very sorry to see the very sensitive situation you and your girlfriend are in.

32,Jennalee,07/27/2018,I dont know how to do this,"I'm so scared and exhausted from this journey. My partner of 7 years has struggled with ED since she was 15. We are 36 now. For the first 5 years of our relationship the disorder seemed to be dormant.. probably because she was working 65-70 hours a week... once that changed and she was no longer being a work-a-hokic she began compulsively working out and reducing her food intake.
My heart is hurting so bad... I was so hopeful that I would get my partner back when the work hours reduced and we could start making our life together..but really she just went from over working to overexercising and restriction..while trying to cover her E.D. with the goal of doing a triathlon..I'm not handling it well.  Every time I try to talk to her about it and get some empathy as a partner of the disease, she just gets defensive, tells me to withdraw energy from her so I dont care so much or feel so hurt. She doesnt see that when she is engaged with the E.D. there is no space for her to be emotionally available.. I end up either angry and over talking at her or just crying... hoping she will hug me or offer some sort of emotion..but normally she just stands there and looks at me, seemingly annoyed that I have emotions about her eating disorder. I'm finding that all of this is making me anxious, depressed and questioning my own body.. it doesnt feel good or sustainable..

33,drlemur,07/06/2018,Girlfriend in distress,"My girlfriend has a pretty extreme eating disorder. I am from Australia, she is from London. We met online and we were friends for a year until  we become involved and I blew up my life and sold everything I own to go to London and take care of her. I thought things would be better once I was here but it feels like they are worse. I really love her and I don't know what to do to help. It seems like any encouragement I try to give only makes her worse and emotionally it's really hurting me that she isolates herself and pushes away from me during her binge / purge cycles. I only want the best for her but constantly I am the bad guy and we fight all the time and it's always around the subject of her ED or food. Sometimes she won't even drink water for days and me encouraging her to try only makes her rebel against that more. I really don't know what to do anymore to help her. She won't seek help and thinks she's fat but she's dangerously underweight in reality. Her main problem is she binges and then makes herself throw up and abuses laxatives constantly.. I stay awake with her as she goes through the pain. I can't stop her taking them she is very stubborn. Also she consumes an appetite suppressant. She often reports heart beat abnormalities and dizziness and her blood pressure is worryingly low. Of course she insists she is fine. Clearly she is not. I just need to know some of the best things I can do as I feel like a failure of a boyfriend and it hurts to watch her hurt herself but I feel the more I try to encourage her the more distant she becomes and the more our relationship suffers but I will not enable this behaviour or pay for her to binge when it only means she will harm herself after. I love her more than anything but I feel like she wants to keep her disorder more than she loves me and that really hurts because it is literally killing her. I don't know how anyone here could even help at this point but just hearing from someone who understands the toll this kind of thing takes on a partner would really help me personally I think. She doesn't appreciate any of the things I do for her or the fact that I care about her health and that is really hurtful. I will never give up on her but I have cried too many tears over this and I don't know how much I have left.Dan",_admin_moderator,"Sat,07/07/2018-6:10pm",Welcome,Hi Dan and welcome to the NEDA forums!

34,drlemur,07/10/2018,Laxative abuse damage?,"My girlfriend has been abusing lax and suppressants and things for a very long time since before I met her even. I've always been worried about this but I can't stop her doing it obviously. God knows I feel like throwing them in the bin when I see them but I know this wouldn't help things any. I feel like any comment I make about them or anything else I do will only make the situation worse so I have to stand by why she hurts herself by taking way too many and it just feels awful having to do that. Sometimes she tells me she has taken too many and has been bleeding when going to the toilet but today she told me she's been bleeding for several days and it hasn't stopped. She collapsed in the shower after being too weak from purging yesterday and all of this behaviour sprang from a comment I made that she took the wrong way so I feel responsible for all of it and she's telling my friends (our mutual) as much who are furious with me and it's making me look like some kind of heartless abuser. In reality I really just don't know what to do apart from continue to try and avoid her triggers. She refuses to see a doctor about the bleeding and I'm really worried. I know this isn't a medical advice forum but has anyone else heard of this happening with lax abuse? She seems to think it's fine because it's happened before and she hasn't died yet but it's very hard for me to take constant rectal bleeding as ""fine."" Plus I know tonight it's just as likely she will take lax again and things could escalate further. I just don't know what to do or what the right thing to do here is.

She’s probably had it her whole life, was probably exacerbated after breaking up with an abusive boyfriend a few years ago and worsened after getting sick from antibiotics a few months ago. It doesn’t help that she lives alone and probably cannot care for herself, has an alcohol problem, and has low self esteem. Most of this post will probably get deleted but I think it’s important to stress just how serious it is. This in not just some skinny girl who doesn’t eat much it is extreme.

36,Mtoto22,01/15/2018,For partners,"In writing a letter to my partner about what I need from him as far as support in recovery, it struck me that this might be useful perspective for other partners of people recovering or recovered from EDs. Here's a piece of the letter, context implied (dot-dot-dots for editing out long-windedness and things specific to our situation)..... Even if I were actively struggling with this disease, anger and accusation and shaming are the absolute worst way to confront someone and express your concern when it arises.....The first time I ever felt myself make real progress in my recovery was when I found good friends who accepted me exactly as I was, struggles and all, loved and supported me unconditionally, saw the best and not the worst in me, hugged me when I messed up, were willing to talk honestly with me about it, and believed that I could get through it. Only then did I have the space to detach from the guilt and shame of what I was going through (which I knew impacted others, like family, who understandably could only respond with fear and mistrust), and learn to love myself as I was (a wreck at the time) and trust in myself to make good decisions. The self-respect and acceptance was the absolute core and foundation that needed to be laid before I could move forward.That foundation can never be undone.The best people in my life were the ones who saw my strength, not my weakness; recognized my successes and didn’t judge me for my failures. That’s what I need in a supportive partner.Mistrust only recognizes the weakness, and in a way forces a person into that identity. In that sense it’s similar to treating a recovered alcoholic like an active alcoholic. It’s like doubting a child who believes they can achieve something instead of supporting them.It took an absolutely tremendous amount of energy to get to the point of knowing that I was safe with myself, that I would make decisions that were good for me. It wasn’t just about eating food, or healing years from eating disorder behaviors, which was a whole other series of chemical roller coasters. My brain chemicals were extremely unbalanced, my blood sugar was extremely unbalanced, I experienced waves of crushing depression and crippling anxiety and full-blown panic attacks and self-hatred and shame. I was so distracted I couldn’t hold down a job or get through school, and I was too ashamed to ask for help. This went on for years… years… even after I got to the point of being my own ally. And that was just the physical, biochemical stuff..... Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that as my partner, I really need you to recognize this strength in order to be able to support me as a healthy woman going forward .....",_admin_moderator,"Mon,01/22/2018-7:53pm",Edited Post,Hi Mtoto22!

37,eatinghelp,03/10/2018,"TW: Eating Disorder and Cardiac Issues, Need Advice","Hello guys I am here to ask for some help after getting dead ends everywhere in the health care system here in Ireland. I am asking for advice for my girlfriend or some kind of experience you had. My girlfriend struggled with Anorexia Nervosa for a long time now, almost two years but she is been eating okayish lately. So basically she starved herself until she was bare bones and it really affected us both but after months of no help from any of her doctors she saw, I stepped in and helped her eat. She is on a steady diet with a healthy amount of calories a day and she counts everyday to make sure she is having enough. She is still struggling with ED and refuses to eat but I try support her during meals. Anyway last year around this time she was very underweight and was in hospital for a month for starving very badly. After she was out of hospital, me and her worked on a steady low-fat diet that's when it started. She started rapidly gaining weight and her diet was comprised of a very low calorie diet back then, and plain foods, but people said it was normal to get some water when people start eating after starving. So after so many breakdowns, I kept ensuring she keeps her diet steady.. As weeks turned into months the weight kept going up and up. She got swollen and started having complications.. She gained weight and her complications got worse. She couldn't walk for extended period or a small walk. If she walks down the road just 20-30 steps she would get super exhausted and suffering to breath. There is been times where she has to sit down on the sidewalk because she couldn't breath and her heart would feel stabbing pain. She has to use wheel-chair most times when we are travelling because she can't walk. At night times she wakes up with stabbing pain in heart and cries alot. It's been a year and nothing has changed only gotten worse. There is been times where she would struggle to breath like almost choking and gasping to breath. Her diet hasn't changed. She doesn't eat alot still or anything with certain kinds of fat. In last three months she has gotten Electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter monitoring, Echocardiogram few times but each time they all come back healthy and even a blood test which was healthy. If we compare her pictures she is getting more and more swollen month by month and her heart feels like it will explode any day. I am struggling to tell her to hang in day by day.. this is made her so suicidal because of weight gain and struggling to live. I have seen her cry day after day and ask for help but doctor's say she is fine since her vitals are fine but I psychically have seen her gasp for air like a choking. Even after eating she feels so full after only few spoons she still manages to finish small portion and cries from the pain because her stomach feels like it's gonna burst. I feel like she has some kind of heart condition because sometimes when she uses a blood pressure monitor it shows that she has irregular heart beats. What should we do in this situation? The doctors seem to tell us it's in our heads and she is fine but she can't do anything psychically. She has to sit all day and take taxi's everywhere or when travelling use wheel chairs..",_admin_moderator,"Sun,03/11/2018-8:08pm",Post Edited,Hi eatinghelp welcome to the forums!

38,Red123,03/04/2018,Trying to support boyfriend with BED,"My boyfriend and I live together and have been dating for over five years. He told me early on that he had BED, but I didn’t really understand the full extent of it until we started living together. I’ve learned to live without certain foods in the house, but that’s the easy part. What is difficult for me is that he will seem totally fine for a while, be eating normally, not counting calories or worrying much about food, then it will start small-we will forget to go to the store and end up ordering out three times in a week. Then he will text me on the way home and tell me to meet him at a restaurant, then he will start finding excuses to eat big meals... all of this would be fine, except that it inevitably ends with him feeling total shit about himself, getting mad at me for not stopping him, and then counting every calorie he eats for the next month and a half.
My challenge is this- the early signs of a relapse are hard for me to notice- I often don’t catch them in time, and then when I do try to say “maybe we shouldn’t go out again?” Or the more likely “oh I think I’d rather just stay in/make dinner, I have this new recipie I want to try” (etc) he just gets angry and either tells me I’m just trying to ruin his fun, or that I’m being a party pooper. I know this is his BED talking, but it’s hard to suggest a reasonable alternative when I know he’s just going to get angry with me. Then, when I don’t speak up, he gets upset afterwards saying “why did you let me do this? Why didn’t you stop me?” (Though when I do try to, it never works!)
I finally lost it on him tonight and told him that “it’s impossible for me to keep up with what I’m supposed to be doing to be supportive since it feels like that’s constantly changing” and that I don’t know what the heck I’m supposed to do. He got understandably upset, said that he’s “sorry it’s so hard for me to support him, that he couldn’t possibly understand how hard it is” (yes sarcastically) and didn’t talk to me the rest of the night.
I feel awful. I still feel justified in feeling frustrated and confused, but i dont want him to feel badly about his disorder or to feel like I don’t support him. I want to support him, I just don’t know what to do, and each time I ask him he gives me a different (often contradictory depending on his mood) answer.
I know that it isn’t my job to monitor what he eats, but what about when he asks me to pick up the ingredients for a heavy meal or meet him for all you can eat restaurant? If I say no, he gets upset, but if I say yes he just gets upset after we are done eating!

40,PoetGuy,01/03/2018,How to help in a new way,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for 4 years now. I have known about her ED since about half way through our first year. It hasn't been too bad for the past year especially. After going into counseling for a second time, it seemed to really help. But she has been out of it for about 6 months and she is beginning to reach an unhealthy point again, and I don't want to ignore it or let it get worse. I am encouraging her to go back to therapy again, but she is saying that we don't have the money (which isn't true) and that she doesn't want to right now. I understand that, but I realized that a lot of what I was saying to encourage her was quite wrong. I was trying to compliment her appearance still and hiding a lot of my own emotions and worries. So it is probably super important I educate myself more and get her to therapy. I wanted some advice on how I could continue to encourage her to go back to therapy, and in what ways I can talk about what I am feeling without upsetting her. I also want to know what else I can do, besides complementing her physicality, to try and distract her. Any tips and advice would mean a lot. I have no intention of leaving her after all this time, and understand that she is not fully herself right now. Oh, and anyone with good books to recommend that would also help me support her, would be appreciated too.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,01/23/2018-10:34am",Edited Post,"We are glad that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

41,Mtoto22,01/08/2018,BF does not trust/believe in recovery,"(Posted this in another section of the forum but realized this was a better place for it)
Is anyone else out there dealing with the intense frustration of a partner not believing you when you say you are recovered?
I was acutely anorexic from the ages 12-16 or so, and my recovery, which spanned a good decade, probably the defining struggle of my life. I draw an immense amount of personal strength from that experience, and my recovery journey is a huge part of what shaped who I am now. As an organic farmer, I am intimately connected with where food comes from, and I rely on a strong and healthy body to do the work that is required and that I passionately love doing. My relationship with food has been completely transformed, and for several years now I have been very confident in my recovery.
Have been with my BF for four years, and told him early on about my past struggles so that he could know me better and hopefully appreciate my strength. I regret telling him, because though I have never relapsed since we've been together, he holds onto my past and continues to worry about me and treat me as though i am still sick. I am naturally thin, always have been, but very healthy. There have been times when I've lost weight due to illness or stress since we've been together, but i have intentionally gained the weight back each time, not just to prove him wrong but because I truly have no ""use"" or desire for EDs in my life anymore.
Part of what bothers me is that he brings it up in very unkind ways (angry and accusatory), talking to me as though I am in the throes of an active ED and in denial and harming my health, not trusting/believing me no matter how many times I tell him the full-circle story. Often it seems as though he uses it as ""ammo"" in unrelated arguments, trying to tear me down. The lack of trust also bothers me - as my partner i feel like he should be open to listening to where I'm at with this, and trust me, and not just make up his own truth. But more than anything, i feel like he is seeing me as so much less than i actually am, because coming through the struggle is such a big part of who i am, and he is in effect denying that whole experience and journey.
This makes me lose my mind with frustration, to be honest.
At what point does a loved one's relentless ""concern"" become a damaging thing that ties you to your past and to an unhealthy identity?
I guess i'm just wondering if others out there deal with this too, and if it's normal to be so upset by it, and if anyone has had luck working through this with a partner.
I also wonder if it's more of a relationship issue in general than an ED issue.
