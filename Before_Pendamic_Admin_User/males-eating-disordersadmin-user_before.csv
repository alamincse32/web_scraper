0,constantvigilance,07/10/2018,Binge Eating Recovery,"Sup, everyone. This'll be my first post.So I've been struggling with binge eating since 2012 now, and decided to do something about it in 2017. It's never shown physically because I like to keep fit.I went and got therapy and have been actioning the steps. They've worked for the most part, but it's so hard. Sometimes I won't even use them because the urge is so hard to get rid of. It's overwhelming. I have goals in life and fitness but in that moment, then and there, nothing else matters. I just want to be filled with food. In the following days, my productivity is at an all time low.I'm trying so hard with the dealing with the urges, but they accumulate (e.g. I'll deal with them one day, then they'll come back stronger the next). I want to get out of this. I'm scared to let people outside my family/past therapists know, and I don't go out drinking with my friends because I'm terrified of gaining weight through excess calories. I've no idea what to do anymore. I just want to stop doing it. Bit deep, but that's the truth, lol.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,07/31/2020-2:32pm",Dear Harold4327,"If you have medical questions regarding eating disorders please reach out to our NEDA Helpline at 800.931.2237 M-Th 11am-9pm ET and F 11am-5pm ET or chat with us online M-Th 9am-9pm ET and F 9am-5pm ET.

1,todded,07/11/2019,Treatment Options for Long-Term ED?,"Hello all, This is my first post in this (or any) eating disorders-related forum or group. I'm a 29-year-old male (former competitive distance runner) who has struggled with a variety of eating disorders for close to the last decade. For me, disordered eating started with extreme caloric restriction for the first few years, followed by years of back and forth between binge eating and periods of restriction. At the present time, I'm dealing with what I know is a very unhealthy behavior pattern. As you might expect, those patters involve semi-frequent overexertion and injury. I've also developed an all-or-nothing mindset where I either am able to track everything I eat and hit my nutrition goals perfectly OR have very large binges. More often than not, I find myself ""staying on track"" during the workweek, then bingeing during the evenings of each weekend, often surpassing X calories on days of binges. Intellectually, I know I'm doing short and long term damage to my mind and body (which, at moments, is utterly terrifying), but I find myself cycling through periods of motivation and utter hopelessness and am at the point where I know I need outside help (in some way) to begin on the pathway toward some kind of recovery. Does anyone have thoughts or recommendations about where and how to start? My spouse has some idea of my challenges with food, but I've largely played down the fact that this is still a prominent issue in my life. Additionally, I'm not sure if I should consider some kind of out- or in-patient treatment, possible medications, or therapy. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.Thanks!todded",_admin_moderator,"Thu,07/11/2019-2:18pm",Hello! Welcome to the NEDA,"Hello! Welcome to the NEDA forums!

2,stanleyfromtheoffice,02/20/2020,Dysphagia,"So last summer I went through a period where I suffered a lot of trauma and an inordinent amount of stress and anxiety which has caused me to have chronic tension headaches, acid reflux, and feeling of tightness in my throat. The feeling of tightness has gotten so bad to the point where it is very uncomfortable to eat anything solid. I have not eaten anything solid since last month. My last full meal was Halloween 2019. I have lost a lot of weight since August 2019 to now. Doctors have done a CT Scan, bloodwork, an upper endoscopy, and a Barrium Swallow Test and found nothing. Still do not know what is the matter, but we think it might be my body stuck in tense mode after being stressed out everyday for months. I have been drinking high protein to keep some nutrients in my body but I wonder if there are nutrition plans online that can educate me on how the body changes after long periods of starvation and what steps I can take to reaccustom my body gradually to solid food without making myself sick.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,02/20/2020-8:56am","Dear stanleyfromtheoffice, we","Dear stanleyfromtheoffice, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove specific mentions of food, which could be triggering to other users.

3,JakeGross ,02/05/2019,"Body dysmorphia = constant anxiety & Low self-esteem, who's been here?","Hi guys. 25yrld hetero male. Part-time musician, full time ball of self-doubt.I was overweight as a child and compensated for that by being the class-clown amongst other forms of coping, i.e fashion in attempts to make me feel more confident -( which probably led to my love for the Arts).In high school I restricted heavily. I called this portion control.In highscool I achieved significant weightloss.
I gained confidence: Lead in musicals, marching band, choir, class president, homecoming King.
I also started a punk rock band.Since graduating HS I've decided to pursue music as opposed to going to college, this, against the will/approval of my parents, teachers, and some peers.Anxiety and depression hit hard.
A lot of parties.
A lot of jobs in customer service
Prescribed medication for anxiety
Multiple antidepressants off and on
Abused other medications to help me escape my anxiety and feel ok with my reality, it gave me confidence, diminished my self doubt.     This was my drug.In and out of rehab for 4 yrs.
I don't take well to advice.
I had to do it myself.
Practically locked myself in a room.
I've been away from, ""clean"", off opiates ( the drug I can't control) for around 3 years now.Gained a lot of weight back after sobriety.
This scared me sh**less
Confidence now completely gone
Anxiety in full gearSometimes I'd manically 'exercise' (walk miles until my feet hurt). I didn't see results.
I started a new diet.
Eventually this diet mixed with poverty has lead me to a new weight. I'm fine with this number.
But not with the mirror.I obsess over my hair, have since puberty
I think my legs are fat, unproportional
Stomach rounded and pronounced
I sometimes I think im generally unattractive, the lines under my eyes, the way my mouth slopes downwards.
Times when I've changed my outfit 6 or 7 times before performing a show (still a musican, folk music now)
Times I've changed my outfit 6 or 7 times before going to the grocery store, to work, to the bar, to my parents house, to the park.I feel I'm never satisfied with the way that I look and this huge lack of confidence has and is TAKING A TOLL on my everyday life. It's hard for me to express this to anybody because they don't believe me unless they know me well. I fear people will think that I'm just bullsh**ing for attention or something. I'm told I'm attractive, I've been with beautiful women, I'm popular in this small town, I'm a performer, I get on stage in front of people, sometimes a crowd, often times strangers. Why would they believe me?  Thank you for reading my story.It would be great to talk to anyone else who has gone or is going through anything somewhat similarAdvice would be wonderfulFeeling less alone would be wonderful(And I'm not talking about AA or NA meetings or else I'd be on a different website or the basement of some church, I'm talking about men that struggle with thier self image)Thank you-jake",_admin_moderator,"Tue,02/05/2019-9:24pm","Hi JakeGross, Welcome to the","Hi JakeGross, Welcome to the forums, thanks for posting. A portion of your post was edited and deleted due to the mention of numbers and specific behaviors that may be triggering to other members of the forum.

4,Pineapple-Boy,10/16/2019,How do you cope?,I've been struggling with my relationship with food for a long time. I knew my eating habits weren't normal for a while and have caused me significantly more distress as time goes on. I switch between restricting and over exercising to bingeing. Food is on my mind 24/7. I've been like this for years. I didn't think I had a serious problem until the past week or so. I was watching a show and one of the characters ate/didn't eat like I would. The reaction from a character that saw this gave me a wake up call. I want to get better. I told a friend a little about it but they don't understand and change the subject quickly. My family wouldn't believe me or take me seriously. I don't have access to therapy or support groups right now. Is anyone in a similar situation?

5,mfwarlock,08/23/2019,I need advice I’ve come to realisation I have an ED this past week ,"I’ve had a eating disorder for over a year and it started after doing a type of diet and losing a lot of weight, It gave me so much confidence and joy I just wanted to maintain my new body. I was careful of what I ate but slowly I would started developing bulimia it wasn’t excessive I would occasionally do it when I overate. I went through periods where I did it a lot then stopping.7 weeks ago I decided I needed to lose weight after noticing I had gained X pounds after not monitoring or calorie counting. I was so upset I wanted to give up my unhealthy purging habit but felt so inadequate and punished by own body, when I realised I gained that much weight in such a short time. It basically justified my reasons to purge.6 days ago I noticed I lost weight in 7 weeks, I went into panic mode and decided to start eating again. Since then I’ve gained  X kg  I’m close to the weight I want to be At I want stay at a certain weight. I’m just having anxiety with such rapid weight gain in such a short space of time. I know I sound pretentious and shallow but I don’t want to go past a certain level of weight, i feel confident and happy when I see myself in the mirror plus it’s a healthy BMI range. I never intended to be skinny I just wanted to maintain the weight I got down to after my weight loss journey. I want to stay at X pounds.I’m currently eating X calories a day for a week and I’m happy to regain as I know it’s good for my body and it’s rebuilding. But with just rapid weight gain am coming close to my goal weight. I want to give up my eating disorder and I will but I’m worried once I reach this how do I maintain and look ahead to the future. I read online about metabolic disorders and it freaks me out hope someone reading this can give me advice.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,08/26/2019-5:06pm","Dear mfwarlock, we would like","Dear mfwarlock, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove weight and calorie numbers, as well as mentions of specific diet regimens, which are not allowed on the forums.

6,imgoingtorecover,08/07/2019,Recovering,"I was just wondering if anyone is recovering on their own. For me i find that when i allow myself to take as much time as i need to do certain things my stomach is more receptive to food. The only problem is that this proccess is both healing but also agonizing. It would take me forever to get up in the morning, for example. I guess the best way to explain it is like a walking meditation, or eating meditation and kind of feels more like a relaxed lethargy. This is where it would take a long time to do a certain task. It's very affective and healing because i become very conscious of my body, but i end up falling back because it can be so daunting and i just quit and stop eating all together. I haven't fully completed like a week or couple days of it even though i know this is the best way for me to recover. I've been dealing with my ED (alone) for so many years. I've tried many different ways to recover and i would just love for it to be over. I am not that good at explaining it but I was just wondering if anyone was going though the same proccess. Also, this place has been so helpful. They really get it. I called for the first time yesterday and i appreciated it so much. It inspired me to write this which I've never thought id do.

7,JMC41996,07/18/2019,Options in PA for BDD and ED,"My earliest accounts of suffering are at the age of 14. I am now 23. When I was 19 I received a diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder. Just a few months ago I was diagnosed with an eating disorder. It is hard for me to write here because my perception of myself has made certain aspects of my life much more difficult. The best way to explain my situation now, is to touch base on the past few years. I became extremely self conscious at 14 after I developed cystic acne. I mean, it was just unusual. It led me to skip school, not look people in the eye, and just socially withdraw from almost everyone except my family and girlfriend who acted as both a lover and best friend. The times I was in school, my ""friends"" would say out of shock ""OMG did you get into a fight""... or times at fast food restaurants there was a sudden conversation about how greasy foods affect your skin; probably started by looking at me then ended with suggestions on what I could do to improve my skin. Well, thankfully my mom took me to a dermatologist. From that first appointment until now the remedy has been the perscriptions they provided me. Its important to note that since I was 17 my acne has been under control, which I am beyond thankful for. My self consciousness was not just limited to my skin. I also despised my nose. I mean despised. I remember getting into countless fights with my parents and girlfriend over financing for it. Told my therapist how uncomfortable it made me and swore that I would eventually have plastic surgery to fix it. Well, that still hasn't happened. My senior year (aged 17-18) I ended the relationship with my girlfriend after 3.5 years together. I cared about her deeply but felt that I was indeed attracted to the opposite sex. So, I came out. It was relieving and I could not have asked for a more supportive network. However, upon coming out... it left a lot of questions for me to answer from others. ""Are you the 'woman' or 'man'"", ""You do not LOOK gay"", ""You are a failure at being gay"". These questions in association with ""suggestions"" on how to improve on being ""gay"" just really hurt me. I know that being gay, liking the same sex, has absolutely nothing to do with the way you look or behave but there is infact this stereotype I struggled to deal with. I had a lot of remarks about my hair. I was shaving it but after suggestions on to grow it out, I tried. I mean tried. After a lot of research I ended up going back to my dermo. with the complaint and she gave me some perscriptions. I truly want to say, it has in fact done WONDERS.i While yes, my hair condition was being handled. I still was receiving this ongoing feedback regularly on how to improve my appearance (even writing this I just cannot understand why their was so much emphasis on my physical appearance in relation to my sexuality but their in fact was). I remember hearing from multiple people that I was a ""failure at being gay"" because I did not look a certain way, like certain things, etc.. Underlying all of this was this ongoing preoccupation with my appearance apparently people did not perceive I was concerned about; when I actually was. In January 2017 I started to go to the gym. Where I currently am, I work at a gym. My peak was Sept-December 2018. I had lost over X pounds however gained a lot of lean muscle. Truth was I was exercising all the time plus restricting my calorie intake. At my lowest I was Xlbs 5'4"". Around November 2018 I knew the holidays were here and I wanted to eat. I honestly forget where I saw it but that was when I started taking laxatives. It's so embarrassing. After overeating, I fast. This is still going on and I do it out of pain. I feel like I am just so ashamed of my physical appearance. I am always hungry. Probably because of how much a train + the emotional turmoil of it all. I went to my doctor a few months ago, told her my concerns. She knows I have been struggling (in 2016 I was diagnosed with BDD after an involuntary hospitalization). She diagnosed me with an eating disorder and referred me to a nutritionist. They both felt like I need impatient but it was in the middle of my semester. I still struggle everyday with food, binge eating, fasting or using laxatives. All for a compliment... I need help but I am so concerned with this derailing my graduation in May. I also cannot afford to take off work. Please, what resources are available for me?",_admin_moderator,"Fri,07/19/2019-1:54pm",Welcome! ,"Hi, JMC41996. Thank you for posting.

9,Oliver278,09/08/2018,Desire to Relapse,"I have been living essentially ED-free for years. I considered it a somewhat embarrassing, but otherwise inconsequential part of my past. I'm 23 now, and I was 16-18 back then; I felt like I'd learned and grown and anyway, I didn't *really* have anorexia because I didn't lose enough weight, so it really didn't matter. Then, my doctor told me I'm slightly pre-diabetic, and that I need to lose some weight. I'm aware that I'm overweight these days. Maybe as a result of being on so many SSRI meds, maybe as a result of a somewhat sedentary lifestyle, maybe as a result of not really paying attention to what I eat. Who knows. So I changed my meds with my psychiatrist, downloaded My Fitness Pal, and decided I would eat a certain number of calories a day. Only, I started noticing some troubling things. I would feel pride and happiness when I ate less than I allotted myself. I would feel intense guilt about eating ""bad"" foods, even if my calorie count was fine. And perhaps the most troubling thing, I didn't care at all if I'd skipped a meal or two for whatever reason, and ate less than I should have. I talked with my therapist, and she told me to delete the app and stop counting calories. I talked with my girlfriend, and now she praises me for ""letting myself"" have unhealthy, which annoys me to no end. I just want to be skinny again. And I want the good feelings that come with restriction. It's driving me crazy..TLDR: My Dr says I need to lose weight for my health.
