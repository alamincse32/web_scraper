0,jalis,10/04/2019,How to choose path of treatment for my sister,I've done some research on eating disorder treatment (anorexia is my sister's issue) but how do you decide which kind of treatment? My sister works full time and has kids. There are centers that seem unrealistic due to the expectation that someone will spend many hours there per week. I also looked at psychiatrists which seem more realistic (1 hour per week or however many sessions you want to pay for). How to make a decision where to start? Each option is a little different. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks,_admin_moderator,"Tue,10/08/2019-1:48pm",Welcome! ,"Hi! Thank you for posting. We’re sorry to hear about what’s been going with your sister!

1,orlandaws,06/14/2019,when will it end?,"I have two younger sisters, they're identical twins and they both have been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa this year. They're fifteen. One twin is hospitalised at a facility for young people with eating disorders, and the other twin is recovering at home but she's too weak to go to school. They're both at different stages in their illness, but it's such a long road ahead that I feel overwhelmed by it all. I help my parents with both my sisters, but the way my mum in particular handles my sister (the one at home) and her re-feeding process/meal plan makes me angry. If my sister refuses to eat something, or cries, or shouts, or argues about a portion size/aspect of her meal, she reacts emotionally, will get upset, will try and make my sister feel guilty for being difficult, or will give into my sisters demands and change the meal according to her specifications. We got to family therapy and have all read books about anorexia, and she should know very well that this only fuels the eating disorder. My dad and I are much more on the same page. I ressent my mum for being so immature and unable to cope with my sister's illness. I myself am tired and I can't see an end to this. I plan every day around my sisters meals and her progress and I visit my other sister at least once a week. I've gone back on anti-depressants and I find work and school too much, let alone socialising. The twins' anorexia came out of nowhere for me and I'm still shocked, even though I've been living at home now for nearly two moths. When will things go back to how they were? When will things be like they used to? I can't talk to my parents about how I feel because I'm scared that I'll upset them further, and none of my friends understand what it's like to have a loved one with anorexia, let alone two loved ones. I just want someone to understand, I feel as if it has taken over my life and that it'll always be there.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,07/16/2019-1:52pm",Resources ,"Hi, iwanttolive.

2,namuuu,05/01/2019,I’m stuck - long post,"Hello, I’m new to this forum but I’m hoping that I could get some advice. My sister has been suffering from bulimia for about a year now. I’ve known about it for almost every day and I feel horrible. I don’t know what to do to help my sister. I should have stopped her earlier but I always thought that she’d be strong enough to stop on her own. It’s been a year now and it’s just gotten worse. I’m so worried about her health and I wish that I knew what to do to help her stop. I’ve tried talking to her but she just waves it off and says that she’s fine. My mother and I are trying to get my sister to agree to go to the hospital and talk to a therapist but she flat out refuses saying that it’s all useless. She already has cuts inside her throat, all that purging and laxatives have messed up her insides so bad that sometimes she has trouble breathing. My sister knows what bulimia does to the body but she’s become so addicted to purging she doesn’t know anything else.I know that my sister has always had a tough time with her body and after her major weight loss it just became worse. She believes that being skinny is the only way to be happy. She always tells people to love themselves but when I see her not loving herself it makes me want to cry. My sister and I have a lot of the same mental health problems and I went through a small period of purging as well, so I know how she feels to some degree but obviously I don’t know all because I have not been able to successfully talk to her about it.  I just want to be able to help her because I’m concerned about her body and her health. I feel bad sharing so many personal details about her but I really need some advice right now. I need to know how I should approach my sister about this, how I should talk to her, and how to get her to at least visit the hospital. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,05/01/2019-11:06am","Dear namuuu, welcome to the","Dear namuuu, welcome to the forums!

3,sistersforever,04/17/2019,Needing some insight,"My sister has an eating disorder going on three years. The thing is, she isn't sooo bad. That's not me in denial. She's definitely too thin, she needs to gain some weight. But she doesn't starve herself completely, nor does she throw up - she eats, and she's been doing so much better the past 6 weeks. She's been eating three meals a day (I think), and isn't as concerned with what she's been eating. But now, she has the chance to be admitted as an in or out patient (not sure which at this moment) at a facility, and I can tell she's unwilling to go through with it. She wants to enjoy her summer. I want that for her too. But I want her to get better, first and foremost. But I'm not even sure if this is the kind of treatment she needs. The menu they provide seems to be less than what she's eating now. She's gained some weight in the last 4 months. Progress is progress, but I can see how hard it is for her to gain weight, on a physical level. How long does it usually take for someone with an ED to fulfill proper weight restoration? I imagine its different for everyone. Do you think she should go in for treatment? Because maybe if she remains diligent, she can recover on her own, with the support of myself and my parents.I also think going to a therapist is extremely important for her, so she can confront the body image and dysmorphia she's been struggling with for a long, long time. However, she's seen two, both of which seem to not really help. I think its about finding the right person. Would you recommend she talks to someone who has recovered? Like a sponsor of sorts? Where could she find help like that? She's been to a group session, but they have restrictions on what they can talk about as to not trigger anything. I get it, but I think she needs someone she can really be open and honest with, and someone removed from her friend group and family.I'm just so unsure of everything. I don't know how to be there for her when she complains about the way she looks. I try not to engage with that kind of conversation, but I just never know what to say or what the right thing to say is. Often, she gets mad and upset no matter what I do. She says that I insinuate that she looks ""different"" aka fat, if I refuse to engage about how she looks, or if I tell her to remember that she doesn't see herself accurately. I try not to take it personally, but I've been having bad anxiety and panic attacks afterwards. I've been very supportive, and she knows that I'm always going to be there for her. I tell her how proud I am of her, and how this is just another battle that she will conquer. But it's taken a big f'ing toll on me. I just feel so bad. I am constantly thinking about it, and I'm so worried about her.Any insight would be really appreciated.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,04/18/2019-4:28pm","Dear sistersforever, we would","Dear sistersforever, we would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove specific numbers.

4,worriedsister,12/09/2018,Should worry about my 16yo brother?,"Hi everybody, My name is CC. I'm 20 and I live at college about half an hour away from my family. I'm worried about my 16yo brother. He's grown very tall and skinny in a very short amount of time. He was a chubby child, and my mom and his soccer coaches used to bother him about it and encourage him to work out more often and eat more healthy. He counted calories for a bit, lost weight, gained muscle and became a very accomplished athlete. They were kind of mean about it though, and I worry the criticism may have negatively affected him and made him obsessive. He doesn't often join us for meals, although I'm not home super often. He eats sort of secretly in the middle of the night, and if I ask my parents if he eats enough, they say he just eats in the middle of the night. This again, might just be what a teenage boy does. However he also is very sensitive about eating food. He will snap at me if I ask, even jokingly, if he eats enough. Over the last year, he has grown very thin and he exercises very often. He plays tennis very seriously and goes to the gym several times a week. This definitely could just be that he's growing very fast and wants to be fit. I know our mom feeds him a big breakfast (I haven't personally been up early enough to see if he eats it. I assume he does or my mom would be worried.) He completely skips lunch at school but usually (according to my mom) eats a big snack when he gets back. A few weeks ago, he actually passed out when he didn't eat an after school snack and fell down the stairs, which scared my dad. My brother, like my mom, passed out a lot as a kid from talking about blood or getting a shot, and I believe his blood pressure is low. Everybody has a different story. My brother claims he didn't pass out from hunger, but instead tripped and hit his head and passed out. My dad claims he had a seizure (which nobody has any history of, and my dad hasn't seen my brother pass out often enough to know what it looks like). My mom believes it was from hunger because he didn't eat all day and plays sports after school. Everybody was freaked out, but it hasn't happened again, and it just got kind of dropped. He doesn't seem to avoid certain kinds of food too much. He certainly doesn't like sweets as much as he used to, and he won't usually indulge in dessert. He obsesses a little over not eating too much junk although he definitely could afford to. Again, this could just be a health-conscious teen. On their own, none of these are entirely concerning (except maybe passing out, but he has always passed out very easily, and the reason is debated). However, this morning I found a bottle under the sink of knock-off weight loss pills that look too sketchy for my parents to have purchased them. When I asked my mom, she said that nobody had claimed them. Since my dad has no reason to hide them, they belong to my brother. I don't have any experience with eating disorders, and the evidence doesn't seem solid enough to bring up to my mom. On top of that, my parents are weird and uncomfortable about mental health problems (I hid my own seasonal depression and anxiety from them through high school and only found a therapist in college). If I bring it up to my brother incorrectly, he will become defensive. He and I have a pretty good relationship, but he sometimes shuts down about certain topics if he isn't in a great mood. I don't think he would confide in me if he were having self image problems. I will be home for winter break for about 5 weeks where I will see him every day, so I will be able to see whats going on. Should I be concerned or am I worrying too much? What should I do?

5,vital,08/05/2018,I am close to a breaking point,"This will be quite long and lengthy just to note in advance. So my younger 15 year old sister has been dealing with an eating disorder for about two years now. It all started in the fall of 2016 when she tried taking her life and everything has been downhill since then. She suffered with the eating disorder right after that and for a while life was bad for her, that was until she became apart of a teen program which made her find a hobby and what me and my whole family thought was going to help her on a road to recovery. At the time she was 14 and became friends with a 19 year old boy there and he'd come to the house and it was just all really good for, but me and my mom and dad (i was 17 at the time 18 now just incase anyone wonders) would tell her you know its wrong to ever do anything right? And her response was always very reassuring and she told she would never and that doing anything with him would be gross and wrong, but unfortunately we found out they were a couple and she never would have told us if it weren't for my mom finding out :( so we were back to going downhill again. Unfortunately there was more stuff with him and multiple times of her running away and another attempt at killing herself and she was off to residential. During that time when she was gone I felt very guilty for loving the time she was away because we'd all be at peace. A few months later she told me how she had relationships with a bunch of guys in that teen program and they were boys who knew me and who were older then me and I just couldn't believe it. I had become a tattle tale and a snitch because when she would tell me things I would just have to tell my family because she puts herself in danger. She has become a huge liar and a very convincing one as well. She takes a lot of my things without asking me and thats created a huge strain on our relationship. I'll express to her how much I don't like that she takes my things and it got to the point my parents put a lock on my door. But everytime she takes my things she is so convincing and makes me believe it won't happen again so I don't lock my door and then she does it again and it messes with my head. A few examples would be her taking a very expensive make up product of mine and genuinely driving me insane because I can't find it anywhere and I thought i lost it for months and a week ago she gave it to me and apologized because she said it happened when she wasn;t eating a lot and couldn't remember hiding it, but she lies so much I don't know what to believe. And before I explain the next part I need to explain that I do smoke to help cope with anxiety and panic attacks sometimes and so one night I went to go get my smokes and it was gone and I was so shocked because I never ever forget to put it back in my bag so I got to her and I ask her if she took it and she tells me no and then I ask her if she'll check outside with me and she got very very defensive and told me no. Then she also told me and god I can't believe what a good actor she was but she said ""well you misplaced your makeup so you probably just misplaced your smokes."" And i went to my room so confused and then it just hit me and I went into her room and demanded she give me it back over and over and then she finally did. She's been smoking a lot and my parents keep catching her doing it and flushing it she has down the toilet and telling her no more! You are going to hurt yourself mentally if you keep using it to cope. Right now I just don't know what to do. My parents are on the verge of divorcing because this is becoming something they can't cope with together and I am so angry at my sister and I know my feelings are valid and I'm not alone but it's so hard to try and be there for her when she lies so so much and puts herself in danger with older men. I feel like it is all her fault and I feel like she loves having so much control over all of us. It is hurting so much. What has happened has made us cancel a huge family trip, is ruining my parents relationship, has made my anxiety and depression so much worse and it just sucks so much. I miss my old sister shes changed so so much and i miss the old me too. I just miss the happy family dynamic we once had and I can't even remember the good times anymore just the bad. My house just has a dark cloud around it and it is so sad here we are all so sad. And right now I have become a punching bag for everyone. When my mom has to deal with my sisters eating disorder and then my anxiety she can freak out on me a lot because her tolerance is wearing thin or if she gets into fights with my sister or my dad she'll freak out on me. This past weel has been the worst of me getting the short end of the stick. If anyone could help me or tell me I'm not alone or literally anything it would be appreciated.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,08/06/2018-4:20pm",Edited Post,"Hi vital, welcome to the NEDA forums.

I called her husband to chat and he just laughted, he said welcome to my life. She is refusing help, I suggested an introvention and my older sister said it wont work. She lives far from me but I said I want to help or shes going to die and no one else seems to want my help? Im extremely frustrated and sad that no one has asked for my help let alone have seeked outside help. I called a therapist in her town who is willing to help but my brother in law is avoinding me. I suggested to him to talk to the therapist himself to better help his wife. They used to go to church every Sunday and have stopped going 9 months ago. I told him also my sister needs fellowship and other women to lift her up, as she is a stay a home mom and has no one in the daytime to talk to.

9,23Taylor,01/12/2018,15+ years of not talking about,"My older sister has suffered from an eating disorder for over 15 years, both bulimia and anorexia and my family refuses to talk about it.
When we were growing up she had major anxiety and would often get into clashes with my parents and sometimes me. My brother and I are much closer in age and were closer while growing up, while my sister always seemed to be on the perimeter of the relationship.When she got into high school her disorder got really bad. She would also openly binge in front of family, cooking strange elaborate dishes, that were practically inedible, but she would gorge herself on them. My parents have never been good at dealing with bigger issues as a family and during her high school years we never discussed what was going on. She would call my mom and me fat, and say nasty and scathing things to both of my parents. She then went onto to college. I will never forget the first Thanksgiving she returned, she was so skinny. My parents never addressed it with my brother or myself. I know she saw a therapist, but that is literally the extent that I know about her treatment. She continued to struggle and have blow-up fights with my family. Sh transferred colleges twice, ending up at a local state school, where she met a boy and started a seemingly healthy relationship. She eventually dropped out of college, but she seemed to be living a more normal and stable life. She had a job, lived with her boyfriend, and had a normal relationship with my parents. She was still extremely thin, but again we never talked about it as a family.
A few years later, I moved back home, along with my brother. My sister was living with a different boyfriend and seemed to be at a healthy weight, had a good job, and even got her degree. A little over a year ago though I noticed a dramatic shift. I was planning my wedding, trying to get into shape for it, and I introduced her to running and a workout class I love. I’ve never known my sister to workout so it was exciting to see her get into it. A few months before the wedding she broke off her long term relationship and her boyfriend moved out. Her weight loss was gradual at first, or maybe I didn’t want to admit it, but fast forward a year later and she looks almost emaciated. I realized that as her eating disorder has gotten progressively worse, so has her dependency on my parents. It’s like she’s reverting back to childhood, and they just let her. I’ve also seen a major shift in her personality in the past year as well. When anything goes wrong, or people are upset with her, her immediate reaction is to break down and scream and cry. It’s terrifying.I said something to my parents about her weight after I heard her purging at their house the other day. They admitted they were concerned too, but said when they brought it up with her she said she’s just been working out more. Which maybe true, but wouldn’t cause this sort of weight loss.And here is the big thing I’ve realized. It makes me SO MAD. It makes me mad at my parents who I feel like enable the behavior (and won’t admit that her behavior has had a huge negative effect on my brother and I), it makes me mad at her who refuses to admit she has a problem, it makes me mad at myself for NEVER saying anything to her. I have never had a conversation with my sister about her eating disorder. So instead I become stand offish and I just get upset and I'm mean to her. My parents have tried to foster a dialogue between us, to mend our relationship, but whenever I try and bring up things from the past I’m told that it’s off limits and I’m just being mean by doing so. It's almost like if no one says the words eating disorder, it won't be true and we can go on being a normal, happy family.
The whole thing makes me so upset that I don’t want to be around anyone from my family. I finally said something to my brother about it and he said he feels the exact same way. So what do I do?
Do I avoid my family?
Do I say something to my parents? My sister?
Ultimately I know I need to be compassionate and come from a place of love, but I can’t right now.
