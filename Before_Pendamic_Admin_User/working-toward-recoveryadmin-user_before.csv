0,AAAlice01 ,09/14/2018,Worries / constant burping,This is my first time writing on here and I just wanted to know if anyone is having a similar problem to me.... This might sounds stupid but I burp ALOT and I never used to being my ED. It varies from good to bad throughout the day. It can sometimes happen in the mornings before I’ve eaten or drank anything and will always happen after a meal. I’ve started having a gaviscon tablet a few hours after my lunch but this only helps for 30-60mins. I don’t know if I’ve damaged my insides from purging for the last two years and my body just tries to bring up whatever’s in my body. I’ve raised it with both my gp and therapist but it didn’t seem to concern them. It is very frustrating and makes me not want to bother eating anything at all because it gets worse after meals. This is when I feel to restrict my diet by just consuming liquids which then leads to a binge and follows with purge. I feel like this is a never ending cycle and after reading some post on here it seems the ED never fully goes away which scares me so much!!! I just want to be able to socialise with my friends and family without having any worries :(,_admin_moderator,"Sun,01/19/2020-4:47pm",Edited your comment,"Dear antreaz, we would like to inform you that we edited portions of your comment to remove BMI numbers that could be triggering to other users and specific medical information.

1,kaneishappy,06/30/2019,coping with anorexia/ bulimia & pill cross addiction ,"Hello all,This is my first time writing in the forum. My name is Kane and i’m a 21 year old college student. I’m taking a year off from school right now to live with family and try to deal with my eating disorders that have manifested in combination with addiction to a medication. Both behaviors feed off of each other and led me down a very narrow path where I felt as though I had to maintain those behaviors to feel comfortable and happy. 6 months ago I attempted suicide because I had gone off the deep end a bit from the combination of malnutrition and pill use. Today, I am healthier and have been clean from the medication but face daily battles where I hate my body and wish to return to anorexic behavior and pill use. Any words to help me stay on the positive path?love,

2,hyacynthe,07-07-18,I'm 39 and Trying to Recover from Bulimia after 20 Years,"I am a 39 year old woman.....bulimic since age 18. I am a mom, a wife, with a great job, but I secretly suffer with this as well as Bipolar II Disorder. I was in denial about the severity of my Bulimia (purging frequently) until I sought out treatment last September. Since then I’ve been seeing an amazing therapist. The first time I saw my therapist he told me that my bulimia was so severe I had one chance to reduce my behaviors or be hospitalized. And that scared me so badly and finally hit home for me that I did start to recover. I  also have started seeing a nutritionist since December. I see both therapist and nutritionist  weekly or 3 times a month. (It’s a lot out of pocket). I have gained weight and my body image has gone into the gutter. I was not underweight to begin with but my body (as I’ve learned) was not where it was supposed to be according to my nutritionist. Besides gaining weight I’m also dealing with almost turning 40 and aging and  detesting how I look and feel. I had to essentially get rid of all my clothing, all my “youth”. Nothing fits and I feel like everything looks horrible on me. All day in my head is a running dialogue about how disgusting I look and feel. I am not recovered yet by any means but I am better. I eat meals now and don’t purge all of them. I went from purging very frequently to less frequently. I have good days and stick to eating meals on a pretty intuitive basis but then other days I can’t fight my triggers.  And I am feeling so guilty and like I will never be fully recovered. I am trying, I really am....but for me bulimia is such an addiction that I’ve had half my life. And if I’m honest my ED began way before 18 probably more like 11 with restricting and diet pills in high school. It’s days like today when I feel despair and question why I am paying so much money for treatment if I’m not going to do the work. I know I’m not going to recover overnight. I just need hope that I will fully recover. I am motivated and I am also doing this so that my kids will never have to know I have an ED and deal with that.

3,camelia1118,02/24/2020,please read my story and give me advice :(,"hi everyone,im new to this forum and needed a place to talk. ive struggled with my weight for a few years now, i've never been overweight i just dont like the way i look. my weight was slightly heavier but it was because i always had a lot of muscle---regardless in jan 2020, for new years, i decided it was time to make a change. i wanted to be strong, muscular, sexy, and comfortable in my own body and once i was strong and muscular, i could eat the foods i want because my metabolism would be high so simply resting would burn more calories than before. so i literally cold turkeyed and cut out a certain group of food. it started off really good. i worked out hard in the morning and then went to swim practice. i saw results immediately and was super pleased. by the end of the month i had lost a good number of weight and didnt want to stop. my mom who is a doctor, ALWAYS got involved though, but i have to say that it was partly my fault because i always talked about it. she knew full well what i was doing---i didnt even bother hiding it. she nagged me all the time but i put up with it. i also exaggerated with the amount of food i was eating so she'd lay off of me. one month into my diet, my mom took me to my pediatrician. i hadnt lost a dangerous amount of weight, and i was still pleased with myself and wanted to keep going. my pediatrician wasnt that worried. she wanted me to see a sports nutritionist though to help me through things. anyways, february hit hard. i got increasingly worried about what i was eating once i got a calorie counting app where i could log every food i ate and every calorie i burned. i was obsessed. i made my goal a low number of calories to eat and made sure i made it every single day. if i went over, i'd work out super hard to burn the extra calories. that's when things spiraled out of control. i began eating a really really low number of calories and i was also getting super skinny. i knew things were bad, and what was worse was that i also burned my muscle and i knew my metabolism was severely slowed down, which was not what i wanted at ALL. i was terrified. i called my mom in a panic telling her i was scared i was going to spike back up to a high weight because my metabolism was slow so even if i ate slightly more, it'd gain way easier. so as a result, i decreased my calories even more. i was so tired. i slept through school, and swim practice was the hardest thing ever. my coach yelled at me asking me why i was so slow. i told her i was sick. i was so tired. the thing was, my weight was never UNHEALTHY. like many people I know are that weight. but it was the manner in which i lost the weight which was unhealthy. i lost so much so fast, and i was so tired and had no energy and my stomach had shrunk severely. my mom, who's a doctor, took me to the ER before it was too late. i was so angry at her,because my weight wasn't terrible...it could have passed off as normal even. but the doctors told me my heart rate was really abnormally slow and that my calorie deficit was causing problems with my organs. they were going to admit me for 5 days but they made a deal with me making me promise that i'd eat X number (a lot of calories compared to what i used to eat) of calories. i thought i'd get away with only eating portions of my food and hiding what i wasnt eating. but my  parents were like the FBI and literally watche me eat every bite. i was terrified. i was so angry and upset. i admitted to them that i knew what i did was unheatlhy. but, i told them that i wanted to be muscular and be able to eat what i want (once im muscular) without worrying about being overweight, and that i couldnt go back to eating my unhealthy ways (too many carbs or too little carbs) and that i want to go forward. my parents promised me that they would help me get to exactly where i wanted, and i just needed to eat more and calories to ""get out of the hole"" i dug myself in. i was willing, and actually excited. the first day was really hard, because my stomach was so small i could barely eat anything. but by the second day, i had like a lot for breakfast and a huge lunch as well as a huge-dinner (which i gorged on, which made me feel horrible about myself). my mom was really proud but i felt horrible. today for breafast i ate more and i really enjoyed it but i feel guilty. i think im taking advantage of my recovery period and that im going to gain it all back super fast, but instead im going to be overweight and no muscle unlike before (where i was part muscle part fat). my mom told me i wasnt allowed to work out and that's even scarier, because im just eating and not getting any muscle. she promised me she'd help me get where i want, and i really want to trust her but i dont know if ican. im so scared. i just need advice. i understand i need like a week of eating a lot to heal my organs but i already look a lot fatter before and i dont think my mom really cares about what i want in my ideal body image she just wants me to be ""fat, happy me"". im so scared. please please please help

8,laevender,02/21/2020,No motivation to recover...,"I realize my bulimia is ruining my life... I wake up every day and can only focus on food; I think my issue is that I love food too much. I use it as an activity that brings me joy and I find that it is the most important thing to me. I don't know if I can live without over indulgence. Purging is a habit now more than anything. My bulimia was about weight loss in the beginning but is now only about consuming anything I want in unlimited quantities. I don't want to be limited so I am struggling with wanting to recover. Another thing is that I never feel full if I eat what I think would be okay to keep down. This makes it impossible to ever recover. I feel so hopeless, and like this might be what ends my life eventually. I absolutely hate loving food and I don't know what to do. It's all in my head right?

9,Abbie_g,02/22/2020,Where do I start,"**background** I have struggled the last four years heavily with recovery from what I am considering an ED. I have celiacs disease and before diagnosis I was eating once a day, sometimes less, because of pain and nausea. I lost a significant amount of weight since then and since that diagnosis I have gained it all back (which is a good thing for my body). But, the last year more than ever I’ve had daily struggles with making sure I am eating meals, not snacks, and I have almost lost the mental strength to keep up with this. I have never seen a professional because I have always felt ashamed for being this way. I am hoping that being here is one step in the right direction before I really relapse. Any suggestions on if I should seek professional help/what kind of professional to seek/any just tips on maintaining the will to keep at it is greatly appreciated.

10,Imgonnawin,02/17/2020,I don’t know where to start ,"Hello everyone,
I want to thank you in advance for any advice given.
However, recently I’ve realized I think I have an eating disorder. I am 21 year old senior in college and my roomates have started to notice. I want to change my behaviors and become healthy but I don’t know how. My two roomates that do know are wanting to help in any way they can but don’t know how and I don’t either.
I am a person who has never been happy with myself or appearance. I work hard to make sure everyone is happy around me and I am a perfectionist in everything I do.
I am working on getting therapy however my school only offers it every other week so beginning treatment is kind of hard.
I need help as I want to eat again but calories scare me. I record everything I eat, I work out at least once everyday, and I don’t eat much but when I do I eat alone and often feel guilty after eating. I especially find myself feeling awful if I eat something like chocolate or cookies and find myself back at the gym due to guilt. Over the last couple days, I’ve taken laxatives as well.
Today I was really wanting to try and went to the store to buy something to try to eat, but I always found myself checking calories on the back and putting everything back including healthy things.
Any advice I can have to get me back on the right track and not be afraid to eat would be appreciated.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,02/17/2020-8:27pm",Edited your post!,"Hi Imgonnawin - welcome to the forums.

12,gretchs13,02-12-20,12 Years in the Works,"I was 11 years old when I wrote a list of what ""hot"" girls had. That list has destroyed me. It has continued to affect me for 12 long years. When I started my ""recovery"" journey, I was 17 years old. My high school boyfriend found my food diary, and confronted me about it. He convinced me to talk to my mom about it, who convinced me to talk to a physician. I had blood work done and we talked and ultimately she unofficially diagnosed me with disordered eating, which I later realized was binge eating disorder (a diagnosis that wasn't as popular as anorexia and bulimia at the time). The summer following my senior year of high school, I took part in a 12 week discussion group with a life coach and a group of other women who had similar food problems. And this type of therapy really helped me. I was the most confident and most happy I had been in a very long time. My first year of college was great - I ran my first marathon, I worked out consistently, I met my now-husband, I joined the club soccer team, and I spent very little time thinking about food. At some point after my first year of college, things went down hill.

13,daisypatterson,02/13/2020,BED ,"hi, I’m daisy. I’m 17 years old and I suffer from BED. An eating disorder that eats me, and anyone around me. I hate that I can’t just eat normal. I mean I wish that I could just eat junk food with my family and not feel so guilty afterwards. I hate it. One day I’ll binge and feel so disgusted of myself, so the next day I restrict. I’ll restrict for hours and day's, then I get this urge to eat anything and everything. So, I do, then I restrict. It’s this cycle that just kills me, drains me. I isolate myself from my family and friends because I think about all the food I ate, and just think they’ll see. They’ll know I ate so much food and just judge me, they’ll think that I’m disgusting. So I told my mom about my eating disorder, told her everything about it. How it makes me feel, how I hate myself for it, and just everything. I thought, ‘she’ll help. She’ll get me help and fix me.’ But she didn’t. All she suggested was that I go on ‘a type of diet’ because I’ll lose weight and I wouldn’t be allowed to eat some types of food, so it would help me not get these urges. I didn’t want to tell her that, that dieting wasn’t going to fix my ED. So, I nodded and said I’ll think about it. Since then she’ll ask me how I’m doing with my ED and I’ll say something like, “oh, you know great. It has definitely helped.” She thinks that if I lose weight I’ll stop hating myself, that if I lose weight I would stop getting  these urges to eat so much. Sometimes it has me thinking, is she right? If I just lost weight would I be happier and just not want to eat so much food in one sitting? Would this eating disorder just disappear? Maybe she is right, I don’t know. I don’t know much of anything now. Is BED supposed to hurt so much? Is it supposed suck this much? Is it supposed to make you feel alone? Or is that just me? I want to recover from this, the healthy way. But how do I do that?",_admin_moderator,"Fri,02/14/2020-3:42pm","Dear daisypatterson, we would","Dear daisypatterson, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove the name of the diet, which could be triggering to other users.

16,janesaddiction9696,02-05-20,Binging and Purging ,"Hi there,
My relationship with food has been lackluster lately, so I decided to sign up to seek helpful conversation on this forum. I've maintained my weight for about 7 and a half months now, which is the longest I've been able to maintain a relatively healthy weight, but I've been doing it through binging a couple of days, then restricting on the other ones. I know I have a problem and I need to work on my eating habits. Yesterday was the last in a string of really bad days eating-wise, and today I decided to do something different in signing up for this forum, because I often feel like my internal struggle is just that, and that everyone around me is closed off from my disorder. Last night I bought snacks from the local convenience store and ate them all, along with tea. Before that I had more food. The gentleman behind the counter commented on how much sugar was in the snack and I, out of shame, told him that they were for a family member and I was bringing it home for them. I just tried to keep in mind that he didn't know the true nature of my mental situation, and that some people are just ignorant when it comes to the concept of an eating disorder. I thought about it a lot when i went home, secluded myself in my bedroom, and ate all.Now I'm just trying to stay on track because I know prom is coming up and I want to be able to fit into my dress. I'd like to loose X pounds or so, but I'm also trying to remember that my disorder is a vicious cycle; feel bad about your weight, eat less, feel hungry and have cravings, binge, repeat. Old habits die hard though.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,02/06/2020-9:56am","Dear janesaddiction9696, we","Dear janesaddiction9696, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove weight and height numbers, as well as details about specific food items since they could be triggering to other users.

17,Samira,02-03-20,Stuck,"Hello,I am new to this forum and hoping that perhaps I might be able to connect with fellow travellers who may offer some enlightenment through their own struggles.I am an adult university student with life long chronic anorexia, at times modified by bulimic and binging behaviours. I have destroyed most opportunities in my life by being trapped in my insane behaviours, including hoarding food, ritualized and restrictive eating, etc. and my thin appearance.I am going through a particularly bad patch - augmented by depression, intense loneliness (as I have alienated most people except my mother, really), seasonal affective disorder, fear, and anxiety - all problems I have grappled with since childhood drifting in and out of care, better and worse periods.I have been starving myself more lately.Part of the problem is that I cannot get any physical activity due to extreme amounts of homework and work that have consumed my life - as school usually does - and play havoc with my mind. I feel I cannot eat because I cannot get any exercise.I am scared about what is happening. I have lost all muscle tone, I'm very underweight. I can barely get up in the morning. My legs and arms and everything is weak and heavy, even when I do eat. I fear waking in the morning in the dark early hours to get to school and work. I don't know what to do.School is feeding into this cycle and I just want to curl up and disappear, but I have no one to talk to.What is going on with me? What should I do?

18,danaaxox,01/20/2020,Scared and confused,"Hi there,I guess I’ll just get right into it. For the past 8 years I’ve  been in a terrifying binge/diet/starve cycle. I have been chronically dieting since the age of 15 and I am 23 now. I have been on every diet imaginable. I think it’s important to mention that I have debilitating hypochondriasis (health anxiety). My health anxiety scares me so much that I’m terrified of certain foods because I’m always scared I have some type of illness or disease so my main goal with diets recently have been those god awful “anti-infalmmatory” diets. However, when I was 15 the goal was just to be as small as possible. I remember my main goal was to have a body like a model. That’s all I cared about. However, when I graduated high school and transited into early adulthood that’s when my anxiety started and instead of trying to be the smallest size I could be (although I won’t lie that was still the goal) I made the excuse that I was doing what I was doing for “health reasons”. I just wanted perfect health in every physical way. The kicker though was that I was already healthy but my anxiety wouldn’t allow me to believe that. After years of binging, then starving, sometimes for days, binging again and then starting a new diet that would only last a few days before extreme hunger settled in and the cycle would continue, I am literally ill. Low thyroid hormone, headaches every day, irregular periods, panic disorder. And worst of all (I apologize in advance about negative talk regarding weight), I have actually gained X pounds over these past 8 years when my goal was to lose a bunch of weight. Food terrifies me completely now. My dad has noticed I’ve been lying when he asks if I’ve ate and I say yeah but I really didn’t. About a year ago I had something happen that made everything worse. My mom found out about my binges one day when I was out. I was absolutely mortified. She said she just wants me to be healthy. But I know that means dieting and exercising more. When I already do both in excess and these binges are a result. Basically I am at my wits end. I haven’t eaten very much the past few weeks cause I’m just disgusted with myself and scared of most foods. My stomach hurts so bad because it’s so empty. I’m genuinely in need in help. I’m willing to get it. But because I’m overweight, I don’t know where to go to get help. My doctor is incredibly fatphobic. I have no clue who to ask or how to get a proper diagnosis. I would greatly appreciate any help or advice. Thank you so much! P.S. sorry if this sounds all over the place I was writing this as I was crying in a panic.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,01/21/2020-12:51pm","Dear danaaxox, we would like","Dear danaaxox, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove weight numbers, details about disordered eating behaviors as well language that could be triggering to other users.

19,siejwiatr,01/29/2020,Do i need recovery?,"Hi everybodyI think that I already know the answer but I just have to be sure.
My story is typical - undereating and overexercising for few months, lost a lot of weight and then my period dissapeared. That was in the middle of 2018. I started to take some pills, gain a little weight by eating more and exercise a little less as well but still there was no sign of period. Half a year ago I got some 'heavier' hormons stuff and finally suceeded in bleeding:) That came along with getting on weight like really fast (really scary). Then in december I stopped taking these hormones (as my doctor suggested) and finished with practically all exercising, yet  it is now the end of january and yeah, no period again.
What's more even though i am now X lb heavier than before dieting, I am still thinking about food more than (i guess) a 'normal people' do.Do I need to eat more, rest more?

I do not think too much about how many calories I take in, but I know I’m underweight and not eating enough.  Sometimes I feel like I go on “inverse binges” — periods of time where I eat nothing, have a little bit of food if something prompts me, then feel like I can’t eat anymore; I end up avoiding food for an hour or two due to a fear of throwing up/having diarrhea.

23,lucyjennifer,01/23/2020,Want to recover but don’t want to tell anyone about my ED?,"This is my first post on here and I’m not really sure how this works, so bare with me. I’m a 16 year old girl struggling with ana, and I sort of feel like I’ve hit rock bottom recently, like I essentially have to choose to recover, or to die. I get it, of course recovery is the only option here – I don’t want to die. But I don’t want to tell anyone about my ED. Literally nobody knows. I’m currently living with my family who are all so, so supportive of me and I know if I reached out, they’d support me and want to help me, but I can’t bring myself to do it without feeling like a burden. I also am currently seeing a therapist for general mental health issues, and I can’t bring myself to tell her. My situation appears so simple. I have a massive support system, I’m seeing a qualified psychologist/therapist, my family can probably afford sending me to treatment if it came to it (that’s another reason I’m scared to reach out for help)- why wouldn’t I reach out?  I just can’t burden my family (especially my parents) with my ED. They’ve already bent over backwards to help me with other mental health issues (depression, anxiety, etc), I’d feel like such a pain for being like, “oh yeah, by the way, I’ve also been struggling with anorexia for the past year and a half!”. Also, even though we are a fairly financially stable family, I know money is tight for my parents right now and seeking professional help for my ED would just be more weight on their shoulders. Another thing is that my mum would blame herself for my ED. A while back, she sort of expressed concern about how I looked as though I’d lost weight (I brushed it off and said I hadn’t been trying to lose weight and that I’d probably just grown taller) and she said that it had always been a worry of hers that her issues with her body (she’s a chronic dieter, and recently had weight loss surgery) would rub off on me and my sister. And I just... I couldn’t bare knowing that I’d be making her feel that way. Because it’s not her fault. I don’t feel comfortable telling my therapist about my ED for numerous reasons: 1), I think she has an ED herself, or definitely at least struggles with disordered eating. She’s a chronic dieter and has lost heaps of weight throughout the time I’ve known her, and has made it clear to me she was trying to lose weight, and 2) she’s the sort of therapist who you’re only supposed to see for a short period of time, until you’ve “gotten better” (???) e.g. gained good coping skills etc., and I’ve already dragged it out long enough that I just feel bad every time I email her askinf to see her, because at the end of our sessions she’s always like “you seem to be doing a lot better. Remember you can always email me but if you feel you don’t need me anymore...” blah blah, and ugh. I just feel like a bother to everyone. And, on top of all of this, even though in my heart I know I want to recover, I’m so terrified to let go of my ED. This whole post is pretty dumb, and I realise how privileged I sound. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t even know what I’m expecting people to respond. I just feel so stuck.

25,thinkin-,01/23/2020,i dont know what to do ,"im 22 and i have been suffering from body image issues and disordered eating since i was a young teen. from anorexia to binge eating and back and forth with very little instances of normalcy. all the while with disordered thoughts. there is no rest from my tainted brain and the pathways i've created.anyway, my current issue is this: i have no idea what to do with myself. i can't simply 'be normal' and stop thinking about my weight and what and how i eat even though thats probably the best thing i could do for me. i feel so out of control when i try to 'let go'. i end up gaining weight and feeling worse. in my opinion, i do not need to gain weight. (sorry about body talk, i dont know the etiquette here) i am a normal BMI. let me get to the point, i just wanted to have you get a feel for where my brain is at. my husband (ive known for nearly 4 years and i married this past september) wont let me go on a diet. i do want to eat healthier but my thinking is very black and white. i like to go all out when i want to eat healthy. but i know im doing this mostly for weight/fat loss. having better skin and getting more nutrients in is just a bonus. he knows about my issues, he knows that me dieting and cutting out foods is mostly just me trying to drop weight. my problem is that i feel like i HAVE to diet or else i wont get relief from feeling like crap about myself. i want my husband to love my body (he says he does) and IIII want to love my body too (sometimes i dig it but im really not comfortable in it), so in my mind i think ""oh if i am smaller, we will both love my body"" but achieving that takes a lot of...pain...i always end up starving myself, getting anxiety and heart palpitations, because i take 'dieting' so far every time.my options:-i try to be normal and stop thinking about weight and food police-ing myself.
outcome: i'll get massive because im gluttonous at heart. i become more unhappy and it triggers myself to starve away the weight i gained.-i eat strictly clean and healthy. no treats. no sugar. no gluten because why not.
outcome: i feel insane and deprived, my husband is mad at me for restricting calories and food again, but im happy because im getting smaller and feel better about my looks and way of eating.-i find a balance in between. somehow eat healthy but include treats while not thinking about weight and about 'good and bad' foods and eating behaviours.
outcome: i can't do the above. i can only go one way or another. i can only think about if im gaining weight or losing weight. i cant eat healthy AND include unhealthy food without having restrictive eating thoughts. i need to have those thoughts or else i lose control and eat more than i need.i have no access to therapy or counseling and i dont even have a physician. i just moved to canada from the US and i dont have a health card/insurance yet and i dont have a job or money yet because i cant work without a work permit (but the WP is on its way). my husband (who does work) would pay for a therapist for me but its $180CAD/hour and i feel like thats too much and not worth it(?) i wont have insurance until i become a permanent resident which i am in the process of. so PLEASE dont tell me to simply 'go to a therapist!' or 'omg you need medication/treatment!!!1' because i really dont have access to those things yet. i also cant talk to my husband really because hes heard it all from me already and all he tells me is 'to just STOP' and gets upset and stressed out. and he also gets depressed because he knows he cant really help me. i am just wondering what i should do for myself in the meantime. somehow be healthy and happy with myself without resorting to ED behaviours and making my husband upset. maybe lose weight healthily?(but me equating losing weight to happiness and comfort is my ED brain talking so ignore that unless you think i could do that to help my mind but do it healthily without spiraling into sick behaviours) and please do not tell me to eat whatever i want but do exercise to 'make up for it', because i know that i'll just exercise to purge the calories...im so confused in the head right now, it makes me want to break things and scream but i cant and that makes me feel even more insane. im really sorry if this doesnt belong here or if I dont belong here and that i written this so lazily without punctuation and capitalisation and thats its a big mess wall of text but i really needed to get this out and i need any help i could get.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,01/24/2020-10:11am","Hi thinkin-, we would like to","Hi thinkin-, we would like to inform you that we edited portions of your post to remove language and details that could be triggering to other users.

29,RightHereWithYou,11/30/2019,Purging: A Letter for You,"Hi there, I hope whoever is reading this is doing well and if not, that you will feel better soon.I wanted to start off by mentioning that I have had an eating disorder for almost 10 years. Mostly battling anorexia but also about a year of purging. I am still in the grips of anorexia getting to a scary weight this past year, the lowest I've ever been. But I am trying to adjust to recovery.I have some things I'd like to share with whomever may be reading this. I purged for almost an entire year. Nearly every single day, sometimes multiple times a day. I was also starving myself for a majority of this time. At around the year mark I learned I had a cavity in my front tooth. Somewhere I never get cavities. I was taking care of my teeth as best I could considering what I was doing to them. But that made me decide to quit purging by vomiting. That isn't where the story ends unfortunately. Around the time I stopped I started to notice that I was going into coughing fits a lot. Something that had never happened to me even with being an asthmatic. I also noticed things like food sitting in my esophagus, difficulties swallowing food/water without coughing violently and acid reflux. That was in 2015. Today almost 5 years later I still deal with those symptoms. Still just as bad as then. I won't say what I think I have in medical terms because I have not been diagnosed though it sounds like dysphagia.I'm pretty sure it was caused by my time constantly purging. Either way, I have damaged my body. I do not know when it will heal, if ever. And I know if you reading this feel the way I used to, then you may not care about yourself enough to make a change or you may care and are just scared of what life would be like without purging. It is scary. It's still scary for me. Even this long after. But please understand I only saw the tip of the iceberg. Things could have gone much worse for me. My relationship with how I operate during the day has changed completely. I must always have water, I cannot eat very dry things, I must be careful when I swallow food/drink. It is not easy. I don't want this for you. It is frightening to be alone while eating not knowing how my body will react. No one really gave me a wake up call. I quit partially because I wanted to for my fiance (boyfriend at the time) and partially for the cavity. But I didn't have a reference point to look to. I knew vomiting was bad but I didn't understand the deeper ramifications. You may understand them and still feel unmoved to stop. I do not blame you. What we do to ourselves is sometimes illogical. Things that we let slide for the very reason that it is ourselves who are suffering. You are not alone in those feelings. I am not here to patronize those who know the risks but to steer those who don't. You may think these and all the other horrible side effects won't effect you. Just as I did. Some things I didn't even know could happen. Please take care of yourself. I beg of you. Because someday you may be better. And stopping now could mean the difference between something that heals in a few years and something that lasts a lifetime. And if you can't stop on your own or have a relapse it is okay. As long as you keep fighting towards a better future for yourself that is enough. You are enough. I'm not the expert here. So many have delt with purging so much more than I have. I just wanted to tell you my experience so that you may know even the shortest amount of time can effect you.I myself am not even out of the woods yet as I am still battling anorexia. But please know that I am here with you. So many others are as well. And we can strive toward recovery together. You, your worth, are not defined by your body or by your relationships with other people. You are also not defined by your trauma or your negative self image. No matter what ED you have you are not defined by it either. You are so much more as a person and you deserve caring and happiness. Don't forget that you have the power to love yourself. It doesn't have to be in an all or nothing kind of way. It can even just be by purging less or taking a multivitamin. It is hard to do those things when we feel our lives are not worth it. Believe me I know. But you must find a reason to fight even if not for yourself. I know I'm a stranger. I've never known you. But I do know how horrible an ED can be. I never want to think that what I experience on a day to day basis could be happening to someone else. So just know that whoever you are out there, that so many people care about you. I care about you. We are here together in this low place but that doesn't mean we are here forever. Even if we return/are returning. We have the ability to get better.

30,alwaysthinking,01/19/2020,Betrayal,"So, when I saw my e.d. therapist on Friday, I had a huge revelation prior to coming to her office, and we discussed it then, and now, I'm having a lot of difficulty dealing with it.  I realized that the main reason I'm clinging to my e.d. is because of my trauma, but for more than I had ever truly realized.  I have always felt separate from my body.  Well, at least, since I was 12, which is when my trauma started.  It's never felt like ""mine,"" even though I blocked out the trauma from my memory until just recently.  But now that I know about all that happened to me, I feel betrayed by my body.  I feel like it allowed all of those awful things to be done to me, so why in the world would I want to feed and nourish it?  I know this doesn't sound very logical, but my therapist said it makes sense.  I blame my body for the trauma, so now I'm essentially punishing it by not feeding it.  So she asked, what would it take for me to forgive it?  Not yet, she said.  She knows that will take a while, so she asked me, for now, figure out for what, specifically I blame each various body part.  I worked on that yesterday, and boy, did that overwhelm me!! I was on the verge of hysteria, and thankfully my prayer to Jehovah God was answered immediately, for inner peace, calm, and His love.  And I still don't want to eat.  Anything.  I do on occasion, and it feels wrong, like I'm feeding a traitor.  I know, of course, that this body does ""house"" me, and if I don't nourish it, I'll die.  It's just so complicated and so overwhelming.  Trauma always is.  I wish I knew what to do.  I'm so depleted and have no desire to do ANYTHING! I know some of this is still part of the one med that my psychiatrist is thankfully weaning me off of, and so much is still from the knowledge of everything that was done to me.  I just don't know how to deal with it.  I'm at a loss.  I want to curl up in a ball and just stop existing.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,01/20/2020-2:28pm",alwaysthinking,"Hi alwaysthinking - we’re so sorry to hear you’ve been having a difficult time.You mentioned some concerning feelings, so we wanted to make sure to post information about resources if you need support:

35,Journey24,01-08-20,Extreme Hunger,"I have been diagnosed with atypical anorexia (EDNOS) and I’ve had a restrictive eating disorder for only nine months
I’m one month into self-recovery and after giving myself unconditional permission to eat, my appetite has increased a lot.
I’m spending 95% if my day eating A LOT OF calories and massive amounts of food. It’s so time consuming and tiring and I’m not even hungry
I’m super bloated all the time but I never seem to feel full or satisfied. I cant stop thinking about food. My stomach hurts.
I never even get hungry and no amount or type of food seems to make me feel full and satisfied.
My blood sugar drops all the time after a big meal and I end up eating a lot of sugary stuff.
I don’t even feel hungry but I cannot stop eating. Its so frustrating. I’m gaining weight so rapidly. Help... no food tastes good or hits the spot. Now I feel like I have switched from atypical anorexia to binge eating disorder...
I’m also taking a medication and I don’t know if that’s what’s affecting me
I cant stop eating ughhhhh. It’s so hard. I also have night sweats.
I think I’m experiencing mental hunger instead of physical hunger because of my food thoughts. Whenever I ignore the mental hunger my body gets all shaky. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to binge but neither do I wanna restrict. I feel like I’m eating out of boredom...

37,alwaysthinking,01-05-20,Invisible,"Why do people, as soon as they learn you have any type of mental disorder, start treating you differently?  This is rhetorical, because I know, it's the society in which we live, due to all of the stigmas the media portrays about mental illnesses.  I hate it, though.  All my life, I've been the different one.  In school, everyone would come to me with their problems, knowing I'd listen, commiserate, give advice, if that's what they needed/wanted, or just be there for them; whatever they needed, I was the person to whom to go.  I would have people I didn't even know very well, by sight only, basically, come to me with their problems and do this.  But the second I tried to talk to ANYONE about MY issues, it was, ""head for the hills, she's crazy!""  Unfortunately, that seems to have continued.  I feel like the only place I ever ""fit in"" is in hospitals, when I'm around others with mental illnesses.  They get it.  They don't treat me like an outsider, or like I have the plague, or whatever.  I hate being surrounded by the people whom I love the most and feeling like I'm in solitary confinement.  I mentioned how I've been feeling to my best friend, (who, by the way, has never treated me this way) and he said, ""they don't know what to say to you.""  My response was, why?  The last time I checked, I'm still a human being.  I didn't sprout 5 ears and antennae, did I?  How hard is it to engage me in a conversation?  I know it's just because they're letting their prejudices about mental illnesses get in the way, and that really frustrates me.  It hurts so much to see everyone around me engaging in conversations with one another, and I can sit in my chair for 20 minutes, and no one even attempts to come over to say anything to me.  So, I am done.  I am closed for business.  If no one wants me to share my feelings with them, or tell anything about my life, or even exist, it seems, so be it.  What's the point?  Why eat?  Why do anything?  I've never been this depressed in my life.  I keep sleeping throughout the day, and I've never done that before.  I've always been high-functioning, even at my most depressed, always doing SOMETHING, even if it's just playing a game on a device.  But now, I literally have no desire to do much of anything anymore.  If people are going to treat me like I'm invisible, I might as well be invisible.  I'm thankful for all of you, who are super supportive.  I just wish the people I have directly around me would be the same way.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,01/05/2020-11:15pm",alwaysthinking,"Hi alwaysthinking - we’re so sorry you’re feeling alone right now.

43,alwaysthinking,12/27/2019,Major realizations,"I had two interesting realizations in therapy today.  One had to do with the choice of how to do self-love that she offered me.  She had me stand against the wall and try to ""feel"" what my body looked like, and then  draw the parameters of my back and stomach on the wall.  Then we talked about it for a few minutes and then she had me come back up to the wall and she had me stand in the area where I had drawn.  This time she put my back against where the line was where I had drawn my back,  and told me to put my hand on my stomach and then draw that onto the wall right where my stomach truly is.  Then she had me step back to see the difference. I was truly amazed. I did not realize that I still had body dysmorphia especially that badly.  I was off by a good 3 inches.  I did not realize that I had such poor body image still. So we talked about that for a while and from where my feeling of having those extra inches comes, and what it does for me.  Primarily, it's fear. Fear of not being accepted, fear of not belonging. Also it has to do with my brain protecting me. I have been hurt so many times by so many people and this is my brain's way of saying Stop opening up because that's how you get hurt.  So these ""fake"" extra inches on my middle section have sort of been protecting me but really has still been hurting me, because I'm still not having the relationships I want to have.  So then we discussed why I do not open up to people except for professionals.  Why am I so cautious and Afraid to let people in and see who I am?  At the moment, I can't remember the exact chain of events that precipitated this entire conversation, but the most important part is that I realized that because I have been hurt so much and have received the messages from so many people that they  either don't want me in their lives or don't care about me, or that my problems overwhelm them, then it would just be better if I simply disappeared.  I do remember we were talking about why I am so conscious of my stomach all the time and always wanting to make it smaller.  And this led to my saying that I'm basically trying to disappear, so I won't hurt anybody. And in a reciprocal fashion, so they won't hurt me.  And I guess what that is turned into, is my brain saying, if I don't eat, that will facilitate disappearing so much easier.  It really surprised me to hear myself saying these things out loud.  I had never actually thought about it in this way before, and I guess it makes perfect sense in a very nonsensical illogical way.  Grrr!! I really hate mental disorders!  But maybe this is a sort of breakthrough that might help me get to the bottom of things and start getting better.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,12/30/2019-1:20pm",Resources ,"Hi, alwaysthinking.

48,CatholicRose,12/25/2019,Admitting I have a problem,"Hello. My name is CatholicRose. I'm a young adult who has just joined the forums today and the reason I have joined is because I've been struggling for years with disordered eating behaviors, and now I think I'm going to seek help.I do not have an official name for what it is that I am going through, but whatever it is, I know that it's not good. In the past, I have done things to restrict my eating, but now it's gone from that to me overeating, either due to not wanting to face difficult emotions or due to boredom. There is also the possibility that my overeating may be due to physical causes as well since my body seems to have trouble feeling full much of the time, no matter how much I eat. I feel like a bottomless pit and that's something I believe I should be worried about, especially since there is some shame that I feel whenever I am eating out in public. When I eat in public, I try to hide myself while I eat because I don't want people to think I am gross, greedy, or unprofessional.Part of me worries about recovery, though. It's good to recover, don't get me wrong, but at the same time, I'm scared that I'm going to use it as an opportunity to act like a drama queen. I don't know why, but for some reason, I always have some kind of drama going on in my life, and it's almost like I want to be sick so people can worry about me. I'm hurting so much on the inside, and it feels like the only way for people to notice how much I'm hurting is for people to see it through my body... That's a horrible way of thinking, but it's the truth. I want to seem as sick and dysfunctional as possible so that people will give me the attention that I lacked growing up. Growing up, nobody cared about me. It was always all about my siblings and my concerns were always downplayed or ignored by others. I was always the one who was scapegoated in my family, always the one who was bullied in school, always chosen last for things at school, and dealt with trauma upon trauma all the way until I moved out at age 18. I learned to hide my problems quickly, and I still haven't been able to show them since. I think this may be the biggest thing driving my many problems, including my disordered eating issues.For the longest time, I thought that eating as much as I could wasn't a problem. I thought it was healthy, but now I think I'm seeing that eating so frequently is an issue because I can't seem to stop and it could very well put me at risk for developing diabetes.Anyways, I just wanted to share this because I am so tired of lying to myself about the reality of my situation. I have a problem and it's time that I start to address it. I'm contacting a local dietitian to see if I can seek services with her. Hopefully she will say yes and also be affordable enough for me to see.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,12/26/2019-3:59pm",Welcome! ,"Hi, CatholicRose! Thank you for posting.

51,Clarissat,12/24/2019,Thinking about recovery,"In highschool I really struggled with eating, binging/purging, over exercise. Basically textbook eating disorder. Half of the time, I only ate what I could burn off and that was just when I ate in front of anyone. The other half, I would binge eat then purge as much as I could. This came in hand with alcohol abuse. And some days, all I had was alcohol. Now I’m in college 2 years later and for a while I felt like I had “gotten rid"" of my eating disorders. Truth was, I now realize it's not something I could just get rid of on my own. I no longer exercise excessively but I starting just giving in to my appetite loss from my medication instead of making sure I eat even when I'm not hungry. After a few weeks of that, I got into a fight with my parents (whose house I moved out of that that exact reason) and started purging. And Ive been drinking again. Now I have to admit I am still struggling with food. I hate my relationship with food and want to fix it so that I can eat without feeling guilty but now think about it so much that I binge. I really just want to have a normal relationship with it. The issue is as much as I want to recover, im too afraid to because I don't want to lose control over my weight. I am not an unhealthy weight. I basically have an average body type that I am satisfied with. Ideally, I want to be able to eat the right amount when I’m hungry, and not obsess over food, but that is without giving up control of weight. I know that as long as I have that goal, I can’t recover because my mindset would still be skewed. I don’t know if a therapist would be the best form of treatment, so I feel like a meeting group where I can talk to other people going through the same thing would help me more; however I don’t know of any groups like that where I live. If anyone knows of a way to find groups or a way I can change my goals, I’d really appreciate to hear what you have to say!",_admin_moderator,"Tue,12/24/2019-6:38pm",Welcome! ,"Hi!

54,Kshaye26,12/16/2019,I'm new to this,"Hi, I'm new to this whole recovery thing. I don't know if I really want this to be honest. Somedays I feel like it would be better for me to just disappear. Other days I kind of want help, but no one in my family cares. And if they found out then they would just send me away, saying I was an embarrassment. I don’t have a healthy relationship with food or exercise right now. I just want everything to stop, and to just feel normal and okay. But one problem is that I cannot afford a therapist or any type of recovery programs.
I'm having kind of a rough day. All of my ""friends"" have been teasing me all day about my weight. I have barely been eating. I have really bad anxiety too, so today, after my afternoon classes, when I was in the locker room, everyone started calling me horrible names I had a full-blown panic/anxiety attack and everyone just laughed and no one would let me leave, and instead started poking at my stomach, continuing to tease me.

56,vordloldemort,12-11-19,Still anorexic or a bulimic/binge-eater?,"My story is that last year I became anorexic at a very stressful time, no prior history of ED. I fell hard and fast became so ill that I was hospitalised for 2 months where they were actively trying to re-feed and safe my life, then I was released to an inpatient program, still very much underweight and ill. In my sore excuse of a country there's only one establishment dedicated to treating eating disorders, owned by the state. At this time said establishment was having massive financial problems as well as being constantly and severely under-staffed so this program was not functional and did not help.Once the inpatient program finished, I did not go on to an outpatient program which would be the normal thing to do as I had no choice of doing so outside of this only ED-treatment establishment. At this time I was still very underweight despite having gained some weight, and as my mind never fully recovered I cognitively maintained this unhealthy weight for about four months. Fast forward to this summer when I decided to eat like a normal person. I gained some more weight fast yet not enough to have a healthy BMI, then my metabolism seemed to heal and the weight gain slowed.THEN the unexpected happen; CRAZY. BINGES. Everyday!I’d feel awful after a binge and I'd swear to not binge the day after but I’d still binge every day. About three months after the binges began I graduated to bulimia because the binges were too much for to handle and the fullness was seriously affecting my daily life as I couldn’t perform daily tasks when too full to move, and I’d have to fix my state of uncomfortable fullness in order to do my job, etc  I’ve been using symptoms for about 3-4 times every day for the past 2 months.Last week I made a pact with my boyfriend where he’d help me with all his might to adapt to normal eating habits and I’d swear to use symptoms. I’ve not thrown up for about a week (a small victory but a victory still). However, I keep. binging. It’s relentless and always becoming more severe, frequent and massive. And I really, really cannot handle it. I even contracted the ED-treatment center that I swore to never again consider but there’s a 10 month waiting list to any program (again, bravo my sore excuse of a country and it’s health care “system”).I’m not restricting my intake at all or compensating in any way as I know that’d make matters worse, but my fucking dream is to just be able to eat like a normal person, if I could just not overeat before 8 AM on a daily basis, that would be great (I wish I was exaggerating, I’m not, it’s a daily thing and just the tip of the iceberg).The point is that I’ve been eating on a regular basis for seven months now, never ever missed a meal or a snack, and eating at least the three major meals for a year. I’m still a liiiitlle underweight but barely but God, isn't this is too much to even be classified as anorexia’s extreme hunger? Can I even get extreme hunger after having been eating for so long? Is this turning into a binge-eating disorder and I’ll just move from one extremity to the next or will this ever STOP?!?I would of course seek professional help on this if I had any means to do so, but this cannot wait 10 months as this is inhibiting every aspect of my daily life, so I’ll just ask this on here with hope that anyone has some tips, experience with similar things or insights.

Along with that diagnosis, my eating disorder was brought to light. I was hospitalized for refeeding and started a php program. I quit. It was a place i felt was not helping at all. I want to be better and they just shoved pills down your throat. Now I'm seeing my normal doc for weight and bloodwork, have a therapist but she only deals with the bipolar. I'm fighting so hard. My restrictions are based on emotions. I shut down. Still no hunger ques. After i got out of the hospital everyone thinks I'm fine. No one understands the battle I'm facing and I'm so alone. How do you fight when you have to do it all on your own? I'm relapsing and falling fast, but i can't stop.

62,valdancer,11-03-19,I need to get this out of my chest,"So I guess I'll start from the beginning. I've always struggled with my weight, I was the fat kid all thought my life and first teeange years, until 2016. I started dancing, and my weight just suddenly stopped, I lost X kg in no more than 2-3 months. I didn't change my eating habits at first, but as I lost more and more wight I became more conscious of my new image and started controlling more my eating portions (rather than whether what I was eating was healthy or not)
I wasn't as obsessed at that point, but I especially hated one part of my body, that has always been ""larger"" than the rest of my body, making  me always look fat.
It wasn't until a year later when I discovered counting calories and it took my eating obsessesion to a whole new level. I downloaded an app and used it for a couple days, deleted and then re download it a couple months later. That's when it really hit me :I started counting everything I ate, I couldn't eat without registering it
With this also came the lying to myself: I would eat and try to ""hide it"" from my own self (ie not logging it into the app) wich made me feel miserable.
However, it was manageable until I started dancing more and more hour. I am currently studying a dance degree at University and food is my number one obsession.
I can only think about the next time I will be able to eat. I can either not eat at all or binge on everything I can find, causing me to have countless stomach issues....
I often use other behaviors in the hopes of eliminating everything I ate, which only contributes to the problem. The amount of times I've searched how to throw up... I can never be myself to do it.
I used to be able to restrict after big BINGES though. I would eat X calories for the next days to compensate. But for the last 2 months, ever since starting college, I have not been able to control myself, since being aways form home has also made me very sad and confused.
I have went from weighing X kg to over X kg if not more, and I feel completely disgusting with myself. I feel as if I'm becoming who I was before 2016 and that thought is unbearable to me. I cry every single night after bingeing on everything I can find in my kitchen
And it is especially hard to go to dance the next day, see myself in a leotard and see Al the damage I have done (or actually feel all the damage, because my stomach usually hurts like crazy and I have too much gas build up)
Right now it's Sunday and I am decided to start my new life tomorrow, but confused as how to. My initial thought is to restrict, but u do not feel strong enough, which makes me feel like a failure. I feel like a failure when I let myself eat.
I have messed up my metabolism so much, I can't even distinguish when I am hungry anymore, all I do is eat and eat and then feel disgusting about it, decide I'm going to starve myself, until the next wave of anxiety and hunger hits.
I don't know how much longer I can do this for before I explode, I literally feel like a time bomb.
Most of my friends know something is up with me, but because I just don't look that skinny they're not that concerned.... Wich is understandable, I have also questioned a lot of times if I'm just a whimp and I should just be able to get my shit together.
It's also messed up how I actually want to be told I have an eating disorder.
So all I do is just get fatter and fatter everyday.
I can't believe I let myself get to this point. I started crying and decided that I need help.
I want to be normal, I want to eat when I'm hungry without constantly thinking about it, I want to not have my stomach hurt so much every Monday because of what I did on the weekend. I want to look in the mirror and not feel like a failure, which I do right now.
My plan is to restrict. The thing is, when you are dancing 7 hours a day it is hard. Deep down I know I shouldn't do it, I'm not stupid, but I also would love to be able to pull it though.
I think I really need someone to tell me what to do, because I've completely lost track of my life.
This is the very first time I have actually admitted these words to myself, and I feel surprised to say the least.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,11/05/2019-12:51pm","Dear valdancer, we would","Dear valdancer, we would like to inform you that we edited portions of your post to remove weight numbers and specific disordered eating behaviors, which are not allowed on the forums.

65,Rebecca53,11/28/2019,I'm falling back to Ana ,"I'm a fourteen year old female in high school. I started starving myself by means of weight loss when I was 12. For years, no one knew I was suffering from anorexia, that is, until May of this year. I lost a significant amount of weight and was hospitalized. I don't remember much about it, but that's when they diagnosed me with anorexia and that's when my family found out how much I was hurting myself. Aside from routinely starving myself, I self harmed and had attempted suicide. The doctors there recommended sending me to outpatient therapy, and getting a psychiatrist. I did both and after a few months of really hard work, I remained on my meds, but was released from therapy and started living a somewhat normal life again. But I can tell things are about to start going downhill again. I'm starting to feel extremely self conscious about my body again since I'm finally in the correct weight range for my height. I've been starting to restrict myself again and I even went a day without eating anything at all last week. It still feels different though, the last time this happened, I wanted to eat really badly and I didn't really have that much of a negative opinion on food, other than the fact that I didn't like what it did to me. Now, I'm hungry, but I'm absolutely disgusted by the thought of eating or even looking at food. I know I'm going to end up falling back into anorexia, but I really really don't want to. I'm going to hurt myself worse than last time if I do, because now I know what to do to hide it better. I need help but I don't feel like I can ask for it since I finished therapy and I don't want to disappoint my family members. Do you have any advise?

67,alwaysthinking,11/27/2019,Overstressed and self-care,"Warning - this is going to be long because I have not posted about my issues for a while.
 So ever since the death of the friend in my congregation, I have been overstressed and overwhelmed  to the max and to my Breaking Point. It has put me in serious crisis points, and one time last week, I  almost landed back in the hospital. I was texting the crisis line and ended the conversation abruptly which didn't bode well and the next thing I know, I had the police pounding on my door and I landed in the ER for a psych consultation. But I had so many appointments last week that I really wanted to make that I was able to convince the social worker that I did not need inpatient hospitalization especially since I didn't have glasses and really needed go to my eye doctor appointment the next day so I could get an examination in order to get a prescription for my glasses. It may have seemed trivial to many but the idea of having to go inpatient without having glasses from which I could see properly was just intolerable. I never want to have to do that again. This past few weeks has been miserable for me. I have not been able to cope well at all. Not having glasses from which I could see properly has made life completely intolerable because I only had three activities which I could do without my glasses, one of which was exercise! And I'm not exactly supposed to be doing that very frequently obviously :-) so this was very stressful. Thankfully I am able to drive without glasses so at least that was not an issue. I had so many headaches because of the eye strain but the thing that has been the most stressful has been the constant battle going on in my head which has nothing to do with the Lost glasses. And this battle continues to wage constantly. I have been overstressed beyond belief and trying to take care of everybody in my life and realizing that basically nobody except for my best friend is trying to take care of me. I Quite often feel like I am  always giving but never being able to take. And it's taken quite a toll on me. So I desperately need a break and I'm going to take it. I'm going to take advantage of the next few weeks to reassess and start some desperately needed self care. Unfortunately, even within my plans for self-care, they still don't include eating properly. My eating has become atrocious. I am restricting like crazy and whenever I do manage to eat, I usually end up taking laxatives. I have the mindset right now of wanting to lose so much weight that hopefully I get to a point where my health is in danger and maybe my friends will realize how much I need them to take care of me. Because I have been taking care of them for so long without any real appreciation. I don't think sometimes that people realize how much we do for them or if they do they forget to express their appreciation for it. When my friend died, people were saying so many nice things about her and it made me wonder if they ever said those things to her. Did she know that they felt that way about her? It's a shame that we as a society so often do not express our feelings to people directly to the people we love most. I know this, because in general, I have never felt truly loved or felt like people Express to me how they feel
About me. That's why I do everything I can to show and tell people how much I love them and how I feel about them. Life is too short not to let people know how wonderful they are. And so I guess a part of me is resorting to eating disorder behaviors right now in an effort to get to a point to be so unhealthy in a hope that it will require people finally to realize that I'm sick and to give me attention. I know it's distorted and I know it's not the type of attention I really want but I also know I'm not getting the attention I do want and deserve. It's so messed up and I really hate it. I also just really don't want to eat. Because I'm really depressed. Thank you anyone who read this extremely long post.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,12/01/2019-11:41pm",alwaysthinking,"Hi alwaysthinking.

68,alwaysthinking,11/30/2019,It's starting again,"So, I feel like an idiot. Yes I realize that's a judgment and I do this to myself all the time anyway so it's no different than anything else that I'm always doing in my head, but I awoke this morning and felt like eating a decent meal. I wanted to eat according to my meal plan. Problem was, I had no milk. So I needed to go to the store to get some. So I did and when I was in the store, I started getting a lot of those old symptoms that I've had before prior to needing inpatient hospitalizations. I was having some lightheadedness and dizziness and what I call fuzzy head. And for some reason, or like I said, because I'm an idiot, once I got home, I no longer felt like eating. But because I was so light-headed I did eat something salty because I could tell that my body definitely needed some sodium. And I also took laxatives. Which I know is completely defeating the purpose. I really don't know what to do anymore. I'm not at the same point that I've been prior to other inpatient hospitalizations, because at those point in times, I initiated the process of getting hospitalized, because I knew I needed it and I wanted it for my health. Now, I really don't care. Which is a little scary. And at the same time isn't. At least now, I have an eating disorder therapist which I never had before, so if she thinks it's bad enough, if I can't do it myself I know she will put me in the hospital. Because I know she's trying to get me into PHP and just can't get a decent response from anybody there. Because I know without a doubt that I need PHP. But now that I'm starting to have physical issues and also since I'm eating less and less every day, I have a feeling I'm going to need inpatient soon. But I don't want it. I'm so depressed though. I don't want anything. I'm so tired.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,12/01/2019-11:40pm",alwaysthinking,"Dear alwaysthinking – we are so sorry to hear you’re struggling with these difficult feelings right now.

69,Oliveristrying,11/23/2019,I'm tired of chasing an unattainable goal.,"My name is Oliver and I'm 18 years old. All my life I was bullied for my weight by peers and family. Always getting comments about how I ate like a cow, I couldn't go a minute without a snack, etc. I tried multiple times in my prepubescence to starve myself, of course failing miserably within hours of beginning and turning back to snacking. A little over a year ago, I met a girl who had an eating disorder and we never spoke about it but i remember seeing how thin she was and feeling extremely jealous. It brought all of those feelings about my body back and all the memories of people putting me down over the years and I spiraled. I had ups and downs over the next year. At first I was engaging in eating disorder behaviors but not to the point of ""this is a problem"". I lost a certain amount of weight (in my own mind) so I went lower. And lower. And I restricted even lower, sometimes eating a certain amount of food and drinking only certain drinks while I was trying to feign of dizziness was pure hell but I kept doing it, trying to get to that beautiful goal of ""skinny enough"". But of course I would engage in certain eating disorder behaviors after going days living off of only a certain amount of food, whatever it was I ate. And the cycle repeated itself for a certain amount of time until something clicked within me. I lost rapidly then and started feeling like hell. Around that time, thinking back on it now, i was having a lot of problems with my mom and little sister and i was probably using it as a means of control. The worse my life got, the less i ate. I felt powerful in my own mind. Putting anyone down in my head if they ate more than me. Counting the calories on their plate and snickering.But I started hating my eating disorder. Started wishing to eat but feeling stuck. I was so busy focusing on how good it felt to be ""better"" than everyone that I didnt even notice anorexia taking over my mind. It went from being a choice to something I couldn't stop doing. Why? I dont know. I just couldnt. Maybe it was pride.Well 2 months ago I moved out of my mom's house and into my boyfriend's. Hes been really supportive of me and makes me nothing but happy. We've talked extensively about my eating disorder and he wants me to get better but doesnt pressure me. What's helped me the most is how we talk about it. We refer to anorexia as a ""him"". Almost as if it's a possessive demon feeding on negativity.I've been working on not engaging in certain eating disorder behaviors and listening to my body. When I slip into my bad days my boyfriend reminds me that it's just the demon trying to save its a**. When I feel guilty for eating, or think of recovery negatively (it's just an excuse to be fat, etc.) He tells me that the guilt is just the demon trying to stay longer in my head. And if I feed those thoughts and follow their directions I'm telling the demon hes welcome. I have to fight them and keep working. I cant lay down and let them have their way. It helps a LOT. I'm ignoring the guilt more and I'm getting a taste of what it's like to not have it. It's still a huge struggle but it's getting better. I dont feel bad for enjoying the taste anymore of certain drinks. Its not a huge step but its something and I'm proud.Anorexia, you're no longer welcome here and soon you'll be gone.

And recently I’ve been binge eating / overeating almost everyday. I am gaining weight and I don’t know if I like it. Before I was at a normal weight. My BMI seemed kind of low but I was fine with it. I liked how I looked but mentally I was in bad shape. Ever since I decided to stop restricting to calories and letting myself eat, I’ve been eating like crazy. I could be eating almost X calories in one day. I have gained weight really quickly and I want to lose the fat and go back to dieting. Is this weight gain and bingeing and overeating normal or should I be concerned? Also is there a possibility to lose weight again but safely right now?",_admin_moderator,"Wed,11/27/2019-11:33am","Dear noeai, we would like to","Dear noeai, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove calorie numbers, which are not allowed on the forums.

72,jester,11/24/2019,What to share with therapist / psychiatrist,"Hi. So I've been relapsing badly, but I have not been keeping it a secret from my therapist which is good. Unfortunately I am a bit lost as to how much to share. I just texted my therapist about this but thought I would ask here as well.I have a therapist I see every week, and a psychiatrist I see less frequently - I will next see him after thanksgiving. I have told my therapist I am struggling with food again, and that I feel a desire to be sicker, but have not told her specifically what I am eating. Should I? I have reached my low weight from before I think so I am thinking I should tell her I feel like it doesn't count because I don't have [physical symptom i had before] and that I don't feel like it is anosognosia because i really don't think i'm ""sick enough.""I also probably should talk about the fatigue and vision blacking out when I stand... But I am not sure how much to share about the food. And the same goes for my psychiatrist. I plan to tell him about this when I see him but idk what to say. Let me know if I said anything wrong that should be redacted. Any advice appreciated. Thank you.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,11/25/2019-12:43am",jester,"Hi jester.

73,alwaysthinking,11/17/2019,"Just don't want to eat, and I feel like a failure","I just don't even know why I'm striving for Recovery anymore. I honestly feel like a complete failure when I do anything. If I eat, I feel like a failure. If I don't eat I feel like a failure. Bottom line, just by living I feel like a failure. I know this all stems from the way my mom treated me and manipulated me and guilted me for years. And it doesn't help the way that I got bullied in school and had to be perfect for all of them. And right now, I just feel like everything I do is complete waste. I managed to eat a little bit today and I'm wishing I hadn't. I've already put at the top  of my paper on my schedule of things to do tomorrow, NO FOOD!! And it feels wrong oh, and yet it feels like it's necessary. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm sick of being sick and yet I feel like this is my future forever. I have to call that PHP place again tomorrow to see if they have outpatient providers that accept my insurances. My current eating disorder therapist is only part-time and can only see me one time a week. And when we met on Friday, since we couldn't get a concrete answer about the PHP or IOP program whether or not they accepted my insurances , she wanted me at least to investigate about the same facility having outpatient therapists who at least should be able to see me two maybe three times a week. Quite frankly, I don't even care anymore. I don't even care about seeing her anymore. I enjoy seeing her. She's very nice and very educated. I just don't feel like it's worth it , because I don't feel like I'm worth it. And this entire post feels so redundant. It's such a common refrain. I feel completely worthless and I'm just tired of everything. Is this ever going to end? I had another flashback today which I'm sure is contributing to my mood. But even without it, I really didn't feel like eating at all today. And when I did eat I felt so guilty. I know logically that my purpose and the whole point in life is to vindicate Jehovah God's sovereignty. And I struggle daily with having any point in my life whatsoever. I hate this battle that constantly goes on in my head. I hate that every morning when I awake, I have that battle of whether or not I'm going to eat.

74,jakjak74,11/16/2019,Why can't I stop thinking?,"I've had a tricky past with bingeing and purging. I started doing about 5 years ago (I was in 8th grade), but I did't do it all the time so I didn't think I had a problem. Then it got a little better for a couple years, but I still did it occasionally. Then one day in 11th I made myself throw up. I had never made myself throw up like that. and it hurt a lot. and I got scared. so I called my friend and told her that I had a terrible stomachache and just made myself throw up so I wouldn't have it anymore. She said I was dumb and told me to tell my mom. I did and my mom just told me not to do the again. My other friend ended up finding out about it but I told him the truth about everything. He talked with me for a while and helped me. I didn't make myself throw up for a little over a year after that, even when we stopped being friends. But, I wanted to do it constantly. Not a day has gone by since then where I haven't thought about it. I recently started doing again, except bingeing even more which is just making me panic about my weight more but I can't stop.

My brain is so fixated on not eating too much, and keeping me in a comfortable range. I really want to get out of this funk, and to be honest I didn’t even think it had gotten so bad until now. I’m not even eating enough for a normal person, but I just keep thinking about how my body will change if I eat more.

87,healn,10/26/2019,is the end of purging the start of binging and more feelz?,"I have stopped purging for the first time in my life. This is month six. Nothing has prepared me for how strongly my feelings come right up to the surface, practically a purging of those in and of themselves.I feel tremendous anger and resent around past pain. While I'm trying to let myself feel and forgive and let go, I feel triggered oftentimes by other situations. At the same time, I have been setting clear boundaries around what does and doesn't serve me and this has been hard to do because others and myself are not used to this. I almost feel I put my foot down harder than necessary because I'm claiming back my power.Now that purging is less present I see how every present binge eating is, and my habitual ways of relating to my body and food. I do feel shame after I binge eat, but also feel oddly relief that I did not purge. This continues to be where i am struggling and frankly fighting every day for taking back the power of my life.

88,alwaysthinking,10/28/2019,I did it!!,"I did it!! I ate according to meal plan today.  Yes, after breakfast, I compensated, but I still wasn't in the right head space, yet.  But since then, once I had lunch, I've been doing really well.  Both with behaviors (or rather lack thereof) and with my frame of mind.  I haven't heard my father's voice all day, and I have been able to hear Jehovah God's voice more and more.  I am SO grateful and feeling content and hopeful.  Maybe I won't need PHP or IOP after all.  I know a lot will still depend on lab work tomorrow, and I definitely did not feel the greatest physically this morning.  I also know, due to my bipolar and borderline personality disorder, my moods are VERY mercurial, so who knows what I'll feel like by tomorrow or the next day.  I do have planned at the moment, at least, to go grocery shopping tomorrow morning, and I intend to take my time and focus on what truly appeals to me.  I actually have enough money to do so.  Normally, because I'm low budget, I have to depend so much on the food pantry, and as grateful as I am for that provision, there are times when I really do get tired of the same old type of stuff and crave food that I haven't eaten for ages.  So, I'm looking forward to this, at the moment.  Let's hope I still feel this way tomorrow morning.  Regardless, I'm just grateful for my eating habits today and am proud of myself for being able to do it, with Jehovah's help, of course.

90,sandragahlinger,08-07-19,Inquiry about anorexia/others experience,"HI all, I am new here...I have a couple of questions. I’ve had an eating disorder in the past, and only realized this past spring that it was back, full force and has been for several years. Not sure how I “missed it’ and have realized that I am completely ignorant about the disease. The attitude is “I need fixing” or “I’m inherently wrong” - the behaviors to a degree are an effort to ameliorate a self-perceived deficit I guess...control it to a degree. I know that this mindset and these behaviors are my “normal” - I was stunned to find this website and read some of the articles (The first video I watched on the homepage was about mindset and eating disorders. I knew other people had eating disorders - and yet, I didn’t know other people thought like me, if that makes sense.) First time around, I remember everyone focusing on the food (or the lack of it that I was eating) and to me, it just came across that this was one more area in my life where I wasn’t welcome....and maybe that’s the whole point, I felt unwelcome in my own life. Somewhere, i got the message or constructed the message that who I “be” isn’t “right” or correct. It’s my dream to be free of this, liberated. I’m not sure if I know how to really live and engage life, though. I first had treatment in my early twenties. (I’m now 50.) I guess I (and everyone else) thought I was “cured” - I was eating. I can’t remember the end of those sessions. I don’t remember them ending or why. I remember life going on but with a sense of...something I can’t quite describe - a feeling of being unmoored. The anorexia actually provides a sense of connection, of grounding, of focus (albeit in a very dangerous way). But these are things I crave. These last few years, all the signs were there. My husband (who lives on the west coast) questioned my eating and sleeping. I was eating 1 thing. My sleep was messed up - I was sleeping on the sofa and not going to bed. (Probably sounds silly but there seems to be a correlation between the disease and sleep - anxiety? LOL I’m up right now and should be asleep.) My heart was acting up horribly - ended up wearing a heart monitor. Again, never occurred to me that it might be the eating disorder. Nothing physically wrong with my heart. (I feel kind of stupid honestly - and ashamed - that I didn’t realize. I should be “better”.) And as I say that, I can see that this, too, is part of the disease (at least I think so LOL). Dare I hope that this mental “torment” isn’t normal and “just the way things are” - that maybe I could be free of it? I’m trying to put the pieces together, understand the disease.I had started seeing a therapist again (not a specialist in anorexia) - good therapist, but I haven’t found anyone (yet) who really “gets” the disease or specializes in its treatment. Everyone wants to treat the food - this last time, or rather now, I’ve found that the disease affects other areas, like finances. I heard someone say “financial anorexia” this past spring and it hit me like a ton of bricks...the same deprivation and denial behavior, the hiding, the secrecy, underearning, the shame, the anxiety, the panic and terror...isolating/hiding/avoiding. I spend my life doing these things or thinking about them. It is exhausting. Yes, it’s showing up with food, but in other areas, it is easier to hide. I’m curious if anyone knows of any resources/research/articles/specialists in the area of anorexia and how it affects other areas like finances, marriage, etc. I saw one article on finances and anorexia on the site. I also saw an article on the personality traits of anorexics/bulimics and how to use those for your good...I’d be curious to read more in that area as well. I’m also curious about other health affects of anorexia - there’s lots on how it affects the heart. Anyone know of any connection to cancer? I’ve started asking cancer patients if they’ve ever had an eating disorder, but it’s a question I’ve just started asking. (I’ve had cancer twice and have long suspected that there may be a connection.) Appreciate this space and any sharing of resources. I’m looking forward to reading other people’s experiences with the disease and of finding the way forward (and free). Tanti grazie!

91,abe123,10/21/2019,I have Binge Eating Disorder,"When I was 14 I struggled with anorexia but I recovered and moved on with my life. For over a decade I had a healthy relationship with food and what I can only describe as a kind of freedom from  constant thoughts about food, weight, etc. Then, at 26 I got my wisdom teeth out and due to complications had a very restrictive diet for a month. Well since then I have developed binge eating disorder with some periods of bulimia. At first I thought it was just a habit, now I know it truly is a habit, an addiction, and a coping mechanism. All things that when added up equal an eating disorder although not one, I ever thought I would struggle with in life. Now I feel the constants thoughts of food, calories, weight, and shame weighing me down again. I know I should find that I recovered once as proof that I can recover again, but instead I am just so sad and angry that this is my life again. I guess I just needed to post publicly and acknowledge my problem, so that I can start trying to move forward. So if anyone has any tips for recovering from BED please provide them to me. Although, I read a book recently and found its focus on viewing BED as just a habit left me really vulnerable to emotional over eating.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,10/21/2019-9:58pm",Welcome!,"Hi Abe - welcome to the forums.

92,katymacie,10-11-19,Not sick enough,"Hello again! I don't really know what I'm looking for out of posting this but I guess I'm just trying to put my confusion into words. Since going back to college things have not been going great, I've lost definitely more weight than I should have and, while I know that I am probably ""sick,"" the fact that I had weight restored over the summer means that despite my weight loss I am not underweight. It's been decided by my family that I should go to a school closer to home next semester so that I can focus more on treatment, I am so scared to actually go back to my treatment team because they might tell me they can't help me because my weight isn't low enough. I just feel like this is such an unnecessary thing to be having to worry about on top of everything else, but I can't even really tell if it's an ED thought or a legitimate concern because in my last relapse I did have a doctor tell me I didn't need help because my BMI was normal. I know that going back to treatment, and probably something more intense than the regular outpatient I had been going to, is probably a good idea if I really want this recovery thing to stick once and for all, but I'm just so nervous about being rejected and invalidated.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,10/22/2019-11:06pm",Resources,"Hi, curly.m18.

93,hortenzia,10/21/2019,Is there any positive outlook at all for long-term AN when you have nothing worth fighting for,"I’m not entirely sure what I’m trying to convey here, so I appreciate it if you bear with me.I’ve had anorexia for 13 years, am now 26 years old. The past 9 years have been nothing but cycling in and out of the hospital and residential centers; I sign out as soon as I am able, lose, am put back in. Absolutely can’t cope with even that point and it drives me insane. It’s a very hollow life. I currently live with my parents and am on disability for anorexia. Lots of health complications and can’t do much, unable to think of anything but my weight. I’m currently on an SE-AN quality of life type plan with my doctors- just let things run their course with no inpatient intervention, essentially.I realize that it’s at a do-or-die point, so to speak. I wish that I could improve (admittedly mostly mentally) to some degree, but it’s unimaginable with how irrationally despondent I become in treatment. I feel like no potential thing I could create in my life seems appealing at all. No degree, no job, no interests, very few social bonds, no redeeming elements of personality. My identity has been anorexia and very little to nothing else for most of my life. I’m at a total loss for what to live for or why, if not making myself feel marginally calmer through losing weight. I know how horribly my presence/illness makes my parents suffer, but I am apparently too neurotic and selfish to be able to tolerate the pain of a high weight instead. I only feel any motivation from guilt, not from the prospect of other opportunities arising, and that isn’t enough.I guess my question essentially boils down to this: Is there any validity whatsoever to the typical rhetoric that you feel less distraught by weight once you reach a healthy one vs. bailing ship on the way up? I don’t trust doctors on this; I feel rather violated in a lot of ways by how I’ve been treated in the hospital. I’d likely better appreciate and trust the opinion of someone else dealing with the same issue. Moreover, does anyone have any experience recovering/improving in a similar life position (i.e. don’t have any external factor strong enough to win out over the compulsion, starting with a totally blank slate in regards to work/qualifications, etc)? I’m not actively interested in recovery but I’m very upset by how insidious the illness has been in derailing my basic obligations as a member of society and how unshakably consuming it seems.Thanks very much for reading and any potential responses.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,10/21/2019-8:26pm",Welcome and take care!,"Hello Hortenzia - welcome to the forums, we’re so glad you're here.

95,sunshinesurf,10/24/2019,sharing my secrecy,"I was diagnosed with anorexia when I was 16. I am 30 now. During the forced refeeding and meal plans I began using disordered eating behaviors to try to regain some control in a situation where I had none. this has continued for the last 14 years to varying rules, patterns, routines and lifestyle changes. At least for the last 6 years, my life has been very isolated. I have lived mainly alone, worked/studied each day and then returned home each night to disappear into hours of behaviors.I don't know if I have rumination syndrome too. I don't fess all this to my psychologists as they have never really prompted me to and I feel like it is too serious or heavy to bring up.
I so desparately wish to be free of it but I also know its like better the devil you know. Its comforting, controlling, familiar and I don't know life any other way.

I soon realized how bad this was and was able to stop on my own. But in the past week, I completely relapsed and started purging again.

100,dianneesmuytriste,10/20/2019,How Do You Know ,"I guess I don't have exactly a normal relationship with food but I wouldn't say I have an eating disorder really. I just eat when I'm hungry and that happens to be X times every couple of days. I have some issues from it like I get really tired or shaky or irritable or dizzy but nothing ever comes of it. Sometimes I really like eating and its delicious but sometimes I try to eat and when the food hits the back of tongue it takes like hot garbage and I can't swallow it. I usually never even think about my weight. In fact I have always wanted a certain figure that would fill out jeans, it gets annoying having guys tell me I don't have a ""real womans"" body. But the second I feel like I'm filling out my clothes or like last summer I went to an amusement park and they couldn't tighten the seat belt to the smallest setting I felt disgusting and ugly and even though that's what I wanted and suddenly food tastes bad again. I guess Im really just looking for someone to tell me that everyone feels like this and its normal and I'm reading too much into this. I got a roommate for the first time and she makes a huge deal about how I don't cook and when I do I just eat some ramen and move on.

101,alwaysthinking,10/15/2019,Vacation,"So, I've been on my solo vacation for four days now, and I really was hoping it would get me out of my funk.  But I'm more depressed now then I was than before I left.  I brought food with me, because I'm low budget, and I've hardly touched any of it.  I'll probably be bringing back 90℅ of it. I just don't want to eat.  I don't care anymore.  About anything.  Before I left, I told my e.d. therapist that I knew I needed PHP, but I was leaving for vacation, and maybe I'd be better by the time I returned.  Now I'm afraid she'll want me to do inpatient again, instead.  I'm so sick of hospitals.  I just can't care about eating.

It feels like nothing I do will ever matter because I've always been this way. I know others have told me why I should want change, but those reasons don't truly speak to me. I feel like I've been stuck in this trap for years and I don't know how to let myself get out. I go to therapy and see a nutritionist, and for a little bit there seems to be a glimpse of hope, but throughout the week the hope fades away into nothingness. All I have left is numbness and the struggle to connect with anyone including myself. I really do want to change, but I can't make myself feel that way during meals.

104,Jayge,10-12-19,Exhaustion and struggling to maintain/make friends,"So, since May/June my relationship with food detoriented. I've always been a light-eater, but the past few months I've just progressively gotten worse. I have a set limit (which is lower than what my daily intake should be), and I feel awful if I push myself to eat more than my limit. I don't know if I would call it a disorder, because I don't care too much about my weight, but I feel like food is all I can think about lately. I'm pretty sure my eating problem is a way to punish myself because I feel like a bad person, and also just a way to redirect the stress and pain in my life to something physical. And it also just feels...good...to be in control and ignore my needs, if that makes sense. In any case, it's really starting to affect my life. I experience physical symptoms, such as coldness, dizziness, and pains, but I'm also so incredibly fatigued. I can get through my school day if I rest between classes. The moment I get home and finish whatever schoolwork I need to get down, I just lie/sit on the floor or on the couch, unable to get up for some time. I feel miserable and exhausted, and usually end up going to bed between 8 and 9 pm. Obviously, this is impacting my social life a great deal. My exhaustion makes it hard for me to socialize when I'm at school, and I'm unable to hang out with people after. Additionally, my mood is very irretable. I get annoyed when people text me, or when my cat tries to get my attention. I try not to let it show, but it also makes it hard to even mentain my internet friendships, especially since I don't have the energy to have a conversation most of the time. I'm also a big introvert, which makes things worse. I know I should eat more. It would fix a lot of my problems. But I just...can't. Part of it is that I feel like a fraud whenever I eat above my limit, and that it disqualifies me from reaching out for help. Another factor that makes me feel invalid is that I can eat a piece of dessert without feeling guilty as long as I stay below my limit, so it's not like I have fear foods or anything like that. Just a limit. I am already in therapy for different reasons (depression and OCD), but I don't want to bring up food because of this fraudulent feeling, though we have talked a little about it. So, I guess I'm looking for advice on several things: - How do I prevent my exhaustion and irratability from interferring with my social life? I really want to make connections with people, and to be able to maintain them. - I know I should be eating more, but how? I have tried pushing myself to eat more, but I just feel incredibly stressed whenever I do, and end up restrcting food even more the next day to ""make up"" for it. - How do I tell my therapist about this without feeling like I'm being dramatic or fake?",_admin_moderator,"Sun,10/13/2019-11:48pm",Jayge,"Dear Jayge, thank you for posting on the forums.

I've been struggling in many aspects and am trying to receive some kind of support I feel that I haven't gotten. It's been getting more difficult to reach out to friends about what I've been experiencing with my possible eating disorder and depression. Isolation has been sounding better to me than asking for help from loved ones, even if there are times that I feel it would be nice to talk to someone. There isn't really anyone who understands, and I don't expect them to since I don't either. But there were a couple of comments friends have made to me recently that have made me feel the emotions I stated before to a higher extent. This past weekend, I spent time with friends to celebrate a birthday. They were trying to figure out where to eat and one friend said, ""let's be like [me] and not eat."" I talked to him about it later, but it really hurt and he said it in front of someone who wasn't aware of what I'm going through. Basically, I'm feeling really alone.

111,document.my.rui...,10/13/2019,Bingeing and Extreme Hunger,"For the past two-three weeks I have been battling extreme hunger. I have struggled with anorexia nervosa for half a year or so and I have been through episodes of extreme hunger before (about beginning of May/end of June of this year) but I've never experienced being at an average caloric surplus over a whole week - let alone two weeks straight. I feel stuck in a limbo of pseudo-recovery because I want to get rid of this illness but I'm deathly scared of fat gain which is what's holding me back from honouring my hunger and thus leads to bigger ""binges"" the next day. I'm very scared that I am developing binge eating disorder, but I do feel physically hungry so I'm very confused. Do people with BED experience real physical hunger or are bingeing episodes for them more like uncontrollable compulsions? I usually find that I can make decisions as to what I will or won't eat (e.g. put something back in the fridge/pantry instead of eating it) during a binge, and I don't really experience any kind of ""blacking out"" when I eat excessively. I also have body dysmorphia and I have noticed that some parts of my body (under my jaw/chin especially) have gotten bigger but I can't tell if it's water retention or actual fat. I don't have anyone in my life to put me even a little at ease so I feel trapped and unable to cope with the violent cycles of restricting, getting extremely hungry, and bingeing. Overeating also triggers my depression and so I lose the motivation to get work done and to compensate for the food I ate through exercise like I normally would have (the latter may be a good thing, I suppose). I'm not sure whether I even articulated anything at all with this but I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm just endlessly expanding and I'll never stop eating because I'll never not feel hungry.

I am sixteen and have been binging for nearly three years now. Any time I try to ask for help from my parents to get me a therapist we get into an argument as they tell me I have made up the eating disorder in my mind and I don't actually have a real problem. They tell me to just ""stop eating and get out of the kitchen."" I am so desperate right now and can't take this eating disorder any longer and I know that I need my parents' support but as hard as I try they just don't understand, they sign me up to gyms and try to make me lose weight because they don't understand that my problem isn't about losing weight, my problem is about my terrible relationship with food. I tell them all these things but they just don't listen It's not that they don't care, it's just that they don't understand because in middle eastern culture, ED's are stigmatized and never discussed in the home.

117,alwaysthinking,10-04-19,Accountability and being unsure,"So I saw my new eating disorder therapist today for the second time only.  I'm unaccustomed to seeing a therapist for my eating disorder because there's never been one available that takes my insurance. She decided to make today about my treatment plan and making goals in regards to that. I wasn't really sure what to do because I've never done this before. She was talking about Contracting and setting up some parameters in order to have some ideas in mind as to knowing when I might need higher level of care. We still haven't come up with a concrete plan because I really don't know what would constitute my slipping too far.  But in the back of my mind, I was feeling very scared. As much as I hate to admit it, I realize there's a part of me that is still hanging on to the eating disorder tooth & Nail. Because as she was talking about  what behaviors would indicate that I need higher level of care, my brain was thinking about entirely too many disordered behaviors that I really wish I could continue. And I feel so guilty admitting that and I feel like a total failure again. What is wrong with me? I thought I had said I was done with this. I realize that a lot of that still has to do with zero self-worth because of my trauma history. It's very difficult to feel like I deserve to eat when I've had so much stuff happen to me in the past that makes me feel so totally worthless. And yet, I really can't seem to give up that feeling of wanting to give in to disordered behaviors.  I just don't feel like I'm worth recovery. There's a part of me that is feeling like I ought to just call her and say I don't want to see you anymore. Because part of me truly doesn't feel like I'm ever going to get better. I so often wonder with both my eating disorder and other mental disorders why any of my team even bothers with me. I'm always afraid they're just going to give up on me because I feel like I'm totally broken and it's a waste to keep trying to help me. Sorry for this entirely long rant.

About 3 years ago I became very ill and was admitted to hospital, where I stayed for 6 months. Since my hospital admission I lost weight in the first few months and now have been stuck at a low weight for the last 3 years. I struggle with restriction and being petrified of my weight going up. The numbers are my worst nightmare. I have tried counselling/ CBT once a week for about a year but I found seeing someone once a week to just 'talk' wasnt enough for me. I know I need to gain weight and I want to get better more than anything else but I just cant seem to do it or come away from the safety of my anorexia. Can anyone suggest any treatment?

I have fallen down fast and hard and I am trying my best to keep my head up, but I just can't seem to stop using behaviors. It stinks because not only do I have to go through the actual act of doing it but what follows and guilt it just makes the whole experience worse but I just can't fight the urge/need to do it. I also forgot how tired it makes you. How honestly an eating disorder in general just makes you so tired. From changing clothes 16 times before leaving, from not being able to understand or control you perception of reality. Like do I actually not look good in this shirt because of my body shape or the color or is it my eating disorder making me see things that rant there. just so exhausting, having the eating disorder take away your ability to be able to tell how you actually look and feel as a human being. It makes days long because every second is a constant question of should I eat this or not. sometimes it tricks you and you think your happy and healthy and you remember something you ate or a bad moment and next thing you know you are right back at square zero doing all the bad behaviors you have exhausted yourself trying to prevent from doing again. And the guilt that has to be the most tiresome and just knowing what you are doing down to its core is wrong but not being able to stop is what hurts the most. wanting to stop so bad but not having control spending so much mental energy and time fighting with the voice to not eat something or to not keep it down only to lose in the end. It is all just so much. It truly is a disease not only does it take away from your joy of food but it takes away From your right to relax, when your too busy keeping youself over occupied throughout the day so you don't have time to eat or purge or think too much when you have no choice but to tire yourself out more because being tired is better than fighting the voices. Honestly, sometimes I'm scared to my bones that I'm going to have to live the rest of my life not being able to help the fact that I care more about my figure and I think more about calories in a day than I do about my actual self.

I had been in recovery from bulimia for about one month before finding out I was pregnant. My recovery was going well, I did put on some weight (at least I think so, I threw my scale out) and was starting to eat much more intuitively. I stopped overexercising, had my boyfriend take my step tracking/running watch and was just going for walks/short runs when I felt like it which was wayyyy less than I was. I then found out I was pregnant and am currently 7 weeks. I’m extremely bloated and my breasts are much bigger. Things are definitely feeling tighter. I have not engaged in any behaviors but my thoughts are so preoccupied on my growing and changing body. It’s been really difficult. I’ve been comparing myself a lot and know I have gained weight.

131,Charliebarr,09/22/2019,Failing,"on September 18th I looked in the mirror after getting ready for a party and cried. I cried because I thought I was fat and I couldn't go out in those jeans that use to fit me. I cried because I didn't like how the outfit looked. I cried because I couldn't get the thought of what people would think out of my mind. I still went to the party but I hid myself in all black and a baggy sweatshirt allowing myself to sink away and hide. From that day on I've been failing. Failing my family and myself again failing my treatment process. I just can't get myself to eat enough, to not work out to much, I am back to that bulimic cycle. I was bad today I failed today I ate to be good but couldn't keep it inside me. I hated that I did it so I wanted to be healthy so I went to the gym but the gym shouldn't be my place of grace after what I did. I know I am only allowing myself it as an excuse to go so I can make my demons happy in my head. I am so tired, tired of failing, and of always having to keep myself so busy all the time so I'm not hungry or tempted to purge, tired of counting, and lying, tired of doing all this and still failing, still just not being thin enough not be pretty enough just not being happy enough. What is the point of It all I've had it both way thin and recovered, recover din big, I've had it in-between, I've had it on total opposites of the spectrum and I just can't find my happiness.

137,pub03,09/18/2019,"Is it wrong that I don't care about my health, I just want the anxiety to go away?","(warning, a sea of extremely unhealthy thinking ahead)
Hey, so,
I recently relapsed into anorexiaI hate the feeling of not being thin enough, obviously, and I have only once ever reached a level where I felt content with my weight once, and it was extremely unhealthy.Thing is, I really honestly don't care about being unhealthy.
I drink, I do drugs, restricting is just another layer on top of it.
And I feel as if not being incredibly skinny is just plain stupid FOR ME, in that, I'm a female metal vocalist, and, well, to put it bluntly people listen with their eyes. Being incredibly skinny, even past the point that is generally considered attractive, just lends to my gothic alternative look. But, all that being said, I do what to recover, but not for health, I just want the anxiety of eating to go away.
What I mean by that, is, if I have only a few meals a week, I consciously know I'll still reach that look I want.
If a friend invites me out to dinner, if that's the only meal I've had in a certain amount of time, I know in my head it won't do any harm to what I'm doing.
But I feel this horrific anxiety even attempting to just have a certain amount of meals. Yesterday I managed to eat an entire meal, with a friend texting me encouragement about how I will be just fine doing so.I should be able to slim down just fine, and so it shouldn't bother me to eat with friends or something, but it does, it mortifies me, when I look at the food I start to panic.Somebody told me that any help is good help, and getting myself to eat is the best first step. But someone else told me that targeting the problem of that anxiety would only make it worse because I would be ignoring the ""real problem"".
She drew parallels with Bulimia, getting rid of the anxiety of eating by literally getting it out, something I used to do, but don't anymore out of fear for hurting my voice.I really just want to be able to eat.
I want that anxious feeling of trying to eat to go away.But the deeply repressed voice of reason trying to stop me from slowly killing myself, is telling me to ask, is it a good idea to specifically try to stop that anxiety... And nothing else? I am not proana, so please don't call me that, I would never want another person to do what I do, but I simply cannot get mentally behind fearing the health detriment of something that benefits me so much when I already do many unhealthy things. I'm anxious about posting this, but I really don't think I can start trying to stop that anxiety without at least asking about this.

138,EstravenAi,09/15/2019,Relapse,"I went to residential treatment for an eating disorder about two years ago, but I recently relapse pretty hard and am now engaging in behaviors every day. I have a therapist, dietician, doctor, and psychiatrist and I've been honest with all of them about what's going on, but I just can't seem to stop. My therapist is recommending treatment again, but I just can't right now. I would lose my job because I don't have FMLA yet (I just started 6 months ago), so I would also lose my apartment and have to move back in with my parents (I'm 32) several states away from where I am now, which also means I would lose my health insurance, so I don't know how I would pay for treatment anyway. And I'm getting a service dog in the next few weeks, so I need time to bond with him and cement his training. Plus, I'm in my final year of grad school and I am already graduating late because of a mental health crisis last quarter. Basically, residential or PHP or even IOP is not an option right now. There is no program or even support group where I live either. The nearest one is about two hours away. My therapist is great, but she doesn't specialize in eating disorders and there aren't many that do in this town. Does anybody have any ideas about how I can get some extra support? I found out that my old treatment program holds a virtual support group for alumni, so I emailed about that. In the past, I went to a couple of support groups, but there are none here. My old treatment center has a virtual IOP, but I think you have to live in that state to participate and I moved to a different state. I'm still going to call them about it though.

143,Alexo_eats,09-08-19,Sister in the Psychiatric hospital,"It's kinda ironic in a way. I left my sister when I went inpatient for ED treatment and now my sister is in inpatient now. I get to be the kid alone and at home, and honestly kinda neglected. I have to pull myself together, and try not to stress out the family anymore than they already are. I need to  take care of myself, so my family can worry about my sister. It's really scary. I'm terrified to be alone. I was alone by myself for 4 hours. That is a record. I think the longest I've ever been alone. Some urges to move around, are hard to fight when no one is there to remind me to be still. I just feel guilty for sitting for hours studying. Even though I know I need to sit down to study. I can tell that those thoughts are ED's. Which should make it easier to dismiss them but it's not. I feel awful for my sister but kinda relieved she is finally getting the care she needs. She has a lot of SH behaviors and it was terrifying to see. I'm really feeling the pressure to recover and get my stuff together. I hope I can put my healthy copping skills to use and not resort to negative ones. It's comforting to know that I'm in a better place than last year so I can cope with this development better. Honestly worried about my mom. She is taking this really hard. Both kids having to go inpatient. Me, last year, my sister this year. Just wanted to share. I just feel like I'm floating. Everything is happening so fast, the house is so quiet.

My coworker (who is also a close friend) said he was sorry which was oddly the most helpful and sweet thing anyone has said, though I didn’t realize it at the time.My mother said I didn’t have one which is fair because I eat normally around family.One of the friends went on a tangent about how she never had the self control or willingness to throw up to have an ED and how she felt guilty for that.The next friend just changed the subject back to her relationship.

145,CASACERA,09-01-19,so alone in my addiction,"for that's how this is. Nibbling on this and that late last night before bed. Grateful for sleeping through the night (woke at 6 but went back to sleep till 7). Like I was going on some marathon. Couldn't get to my breakfast fast enough. Decided on one that would be easiest on my stomach.The veracity with which I eat is so scary. Like I'm someone else and I'm not. I am so sorry for everyone here that suffers but I wish there was another soul with BED. I use to be able to get away for a break. Not an option anymore. And the terribly sad thing is, I know there are people who cannot talk about this. My best friend whom I met at a facility said to me recently. I'm the only one she can talk to about this but right now she's shut off, 'cause she's trying some new system. My ED feels different from bulimia because I feel like I have to live with the pain of and results of my behavior. I don't hate myself. I've struggled my whole life just managing something I have to keep doing to live. How to explain I operate on two levels. The CC that takes good care of herself and the subconscious part that pushes me and demands gratification and the sensation of turning to food. Waiting, longing for the oasis of blessed remission that I get every so often. Whoever reads this, thank you. I can't walk around and complain about this. There is no program of any sort here. And, I spent 15 yrs. in a well known support group system (not helpful). Hope to go for a bike ride later. Debating whether or not to post this. Well here goes. Hope I haven't upset anyone.

146,roseec,09-04-19,Binge eating/Anorexia cycle feels never ending,"I've been struggling with the binge eat, gain weight, then restrict cycle for years and years. I restrict and become too thin and people worry, and then suddenly I spend one night binging and its all I do for a period of time. I don't understand how no one has noticed this cycle of me being thin and then a little chubby over and over. My eating habits have been severely disordered since I was 14, I am almost 21 now. When I was 13 I was put into a residential treatment center for issues centered around depression and self harm. I feel my eating disorder really developed here. I dont think the staff were fully equipped to deal with my growing illness and responded by just making me eat 100% of every meal, many of them being pretty large. I heavily abused laxatives from 14-15, was always a little underweight as a teen, and the past 2 years or so have just been an endless cycle of binge and restrict. I feel so lost in this. I don't know how to reach out and let people know this is bigger than it may appear. I'm suffering so much and I know my body is too, constantly going from one extreme to the other. I also deal with irritable bowel syndrome so when I take in mass amounts of foods my body doesn't like I become very sick, but that doesn't stop me. I've also had two serious boyfriends who also dealt with eating disorders(bulimia) and I can't imagine that has helped me. I never feel happy with my body either way, but especially when I gain weight binging it destroys my confidence, I don't even want to go outside. I finally told my mom a few months ago how bad this was after I had lost a large amount of weight after a very painful breakup. I am currently on a waitlist for outpatient therapy at a treatment facility but I don't know how much longer I can wait. I've since gained the weight back and probably plus some. I'm currently in the binge cycle but I know soon I will break down and the restricting will return. I feel hopeless in this.

148,Charliebarr,08/27/2019,Hi I'm back and Slipping ,"Hi guys, it has been a decent amount of time since I have posted here. Honestly I feel I have fooled myself that I was better because over the summer I was distracted and keeping myself busy and having fun. However, I have been back at college for a week and a Half now and after going about 3 months without purging today I purged. Along with this I find myself getting anxiety again when I have to eat or even when I think about food, I am restricting and I am already starting to feel my brain over working exercise. I signed up for boxing because treatment told me organized exercise is really good after recovery and I told myself I would go certain days but I find myself going X times a week instead. I can already see my self cracking after thinking I was doing so much better. I do not know why this is happening either I don't have a lot of stress right now and I am happy honestly. I just am confused as to were these thoughts are coming from, not to say that I am 100% happy with the way I look. Looking in a mirror still hurts my soul but not like it used to. I am nervous because school just started and it is only going to get more intense from here. I don't really know what to do to reel it i. I want to be healthy but I also feel that I need to lose weight so I feel better about myself. I think a big problem I am having is trying to find middle ground. I have a very big all or nothing mentality. Along with this I think that I still crave the control and I may be pre-planning for school to get rough. By giving myself control over this now maybe I can prepare for the bad stuff in the future. I don't know if that really made sense I'm kinda typing and thinking at the same time trying to just get my thoughts out.",_admin_moderator,"Mon,09/02/2019-7:28pm",Edited Your Post,"Hi, Charliebarr - welcome back to the forums!

151,meagan1995,08/14/2019, New and Looking for Support,"Hi all! I'm newly entering the world of seeking treatment for years of eating disorders. It's strange to open up to myself about the realities of my experience with the disorder, much less to open up to my therapist, friends, and others. I'm wondering if anyone has specific advice or experiences they could share about coming to terms with recovery, as well as building a broad, honest, and authentic support network. My family is not supportive, and my friends are either unaware or uncomfortable with discussing eating disorders and mental health in general, so I find myself feeling lonely and isolated more often than not. I'd really appreciate any advice you all have to offer, or even just to hear about your own experiences.
Lots of love and healing!

152,alwaysthinking,08/26/2019,Slight setback?,"I'm kind of worried and a little scared and very anxious right now. I've been doing well for most of the day except for when I was doing my own choice of exposures. Yes I'm doing my own PHP again since I can't get into a hospital at the moment. I was doing an imaginal and that alone was giving me a lot of anxiety because I have a doctor's appointment on Friday where I know I will be getting weighed again, and one part of me is afraid that because I've started eating again I'm going to freak out when I see my weight. I know logically it really doesn't matter and what it really means is that hopefully I get to go on vacation later on this year and it means I got to do my ministry soon. But, as our inner voice loves to lie to us and mess with our heads of course there's a part of me that is freaking out about something that hasn't even happened yet. But for the most part I've been able to talk myself out of it using logic and get through the day. Then came supper, which made my anxiety increase exponentially, and I've been in freakout mode ever since and now I'm beginning to think I do need the hospital after all. So I really wish the one Hospital would make a decision and let me know what it is so that if they don't accept me I can start calling other ones. Because I also really want to be out of the hospital before it's time for my vacation start. I really thought I could do this on my own oh, which really isn't on my own because Jehovah God is always helping me and is always with me. And maybe by tomorrow or even later on tonight I'll feel that way again. Right now though I'm freaking out and it feels like a major setback and it feels like I just cannot do this on my own or at least without professional help I guess I should qualify by saying that. I hope I have other options. I'm just scared. Even though I know logically I still am not eating very much , it seems like it's been too much too fast. I need to get myself some space from all of this anxiety.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,08/27/2019-12:43am","Hi, all!","Hi, all!

154,alwaysthinking,08/25/2019,"Another day, another meal","So, today I had another meal and a small version of a snack. I'm starting in gradually so my body doesn't go into shock and also so I can prepare my brain for regular eating. I've been really doing well and very little anxiety at all about the eating today. For which I'm very grateful. I know that this is because Jehovah God has given me the confidence I need, knowing that he is giving me the strength that I need as well. I have found that the thing that was worrying me the most and also the thing that was preventing me from being able to eat prior to this was having people's Voices From the Past in my head constantly telling me not to eat. And also they would tell me that if I did eat to compensate for it. So instead of just telling them to shut up and saying I wasn't going to listen to them I realized I had to listen to someone else. That someone of course is God. As well as my own mind. I'm reclaiming my power. It sounds kind of weird to say that because I've never had any power of my own to begin with so I'm just claiming my power for the first time ever. And it feels great. I was really worried that my trauma issues were going to screw up all of this and they haven't been an issue. It's as if because I'm not doing what their voices told me to do, they're not going to hurt me anymore with other trauma related things. And I really hope all of this is allowed to be said, moderators. I know this is a tricky issue and I don't want to trigger anybody but it really goes to the entire reason for my eating disorder and for my success today and the past two days. So I hope all of this is okay to be said, and I am just so grateful for yet another success.

155,Humming_Bird_Woman,08/22/2019,Addicted about Food without feeling Fat or Sick.,"Hi. I am a newby ! I am french, married, 33 years old. So sorry in advance for my English .... :) I've started a diet almost 3 years ago because I wanted to feel good in my body. I've always felt bad with my body image (a little bit overweight and hairy.... :(...) For 2 years, i am bulimic :( :( :( But I really want to recover so I force myself to stop purging but I still have urges to binge so I gain weight ... I haven't stood on my scales for 10 days and I am so happy for that but I know I still am fragile and I can lose control more than I do now :( I've always felt an empty space in me... Like i can't do things alone.. I always need others and being reassured ! I'm still on track to recover but I need to find girls/women like me to share expériences and : - improving my English (It's like having a new passion .... I wanna improve my language skills to think about another thing than food) - Winning self esteem to do things alone and stop being perfectionist. - Stop being addicted with food (I've always thought about food for a long long time even when i wasn't sick. for you too ? I don't know why and that is why i am scared because I know i was addicted before being bulimic (and then restricting myself). indeed, before when i was with family or with friends, i didn't understand why i ate more than us i was really an addict ... even if i ate before... why ? just because bad habits I've created in my childhood ? Actually it's weird but i am more scared to be like before (aka thinking about food again and again even if i nourish myseff well, eating a large amount of food compared to others people) than gaining weight. i've never been fat but i've always ate more than others and i don't know why. my husband for example can forget to eat but not me .... why ? am i not normal ??? I would love to find some people to talk to trought Instagram, Messenger or Skype. if anyone is interested... it would be a pleasure ! :)",_admin_moderator,"Thu,08/22/2019-4:39pm",Welcome! ,"Hi!

156,Buddy58,08/22/2019,Overshoot?,"Hi,I am hoping anyone here has any guidance on this topic. Growing up I was always a chubby kid, doctors always told me that I needed to lose weight. 2 years ago, I went on a certain diet and lost a good amount of weight over a certain amount of time. I lost at a very steady weight. After I went to college I became obsessed with losing weight and became anorexic. I would workout excessively and fast until dinner.I have been in recovery for about a year but have been struggling. I gained all the weight back and am now back at the weight I was when I was overweight in high school. I have been eating very regularly and still trying to nourish my body. Is this where my weight will most likely be because I’ve spent most of my life here? Will it ever go back down? Is there something I should try and do differently?Suggestions appreciated!",_admin_moderator,"Fri,08/23/2019-12:17pm",Post Edited ,"Hi Buddy58,  We are glad to hear that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

157,c.cake214,08/22/2019,"I want to get better, but I have no hope","I don't remember when I noticed myself restricting. I grew up not having a lot to eat in the first place. Now that I'm older and have a job and can now purchase my own food, I thought I would be doing it all the time. Now I find excuses to avoid the grocery store as much as possible, and even when I'm there, the prospect of eating ANYTHING disgusts me. I've always been a picky eater, but I feel like it's leading to a terrible downfall.
I'm out here trying to reconnect with food. I'm trying to re-establish a relationship with it that I actually feel as if I benefit from. Here's what breaks my heart though.
I have a support system. The best one I could ask for, really. Yesterday really made me realize something. I always thought that if I could cook something for myself instead of whatever fast-food I could pick up, I'd start to love eating more. With that said, I went to the grocery store yesterday with some friends to buy ingredients. I cook the entire meal, they eat.... And I go home with my leftovers in tow. I look at the leftovers all day. I try to eat one. I take a bite and am immediately sick to my stomach. It's like my body doesn't want anything inside of it anymore. I feel hunger but I hate food. I'm not scared of gaining weight, in fact I've been TRYING to gain for almost a year now. The closest ED specialist works about 114 miles away from where I live, but I'm so desperate I might just be willing to make the trip. I hate that I'd be undertaking all of this while starting up school again, but god I'm tired of feeling sick and helpless all the time.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,08/22/2019-4:41pm",Resources ,"Hi!

I'm wondering what to do. I have a mental illness and receive individual therapy for it but now that my symptoms from that have seemed to fade it's uncovered some severe anxiety and disordered eating. All my thoughts revolved around food, planning, exercise, and weight. I eat until I'm overly stuffed and almost throwing up. Luckily I have celiac disease and avoid processed food so I'm binging on certain food most of the time but I'm miserable. My brain tells me eat or die. I love my current therapist but she says she doesn't have experience treating eating disorders.I'm wondering if there are resources so she can continue to treat me or what treatment I should seek. I want a healthy relationship with food. I'm preparing for medical school and believe that food is medicine but the way I'm using it now is killing me.

I have attempted to recover several times but I’m too scared of gaining back all the weights and losing control. I have been eating X kcal/ day the last 2 weeks but gained none and I eventually decided to restrict this week. I ate today and used behaviors.

I’m scared the gain will come this week or next week so I want to restrict again. I don’t know what is my ideal weight. I look thinner than those models I found online. I’m scared if I gain to the weight I want now, I will have to restrict later, and as I’m going on holiday 1 month later, I’m afraid I will gain even more. I’m such a mess. I want peace in mind.

163,alwaysthinking,08/17/2019, Feel like a disaster,"Today has not been good. I've had zero motivation or desire to do anything and I've been super tired, primarily because of the zero sleep  I had the night before last. But the biggest problem today has been what keeps going round and round in my head. I'm having so much anxiety about worrying that the places that I called for treatment aren't going to accept me because they're going to think that I'm not sick enough. So even though I know my assessments over with and I can't amend it in any way, I have been doing stuff today that could be very detrimental to my health in the hopes that I will be sick enough. I feel like a total disaster. There's a part of me that just wants to give up completely and say forget it it's not worth it. And yet the fighter in me is saying no, I want to live. That's why I called those places. I know I need help. I can't do this on my own. But my experience with the ER has me so frazzled that I'm feeling like no one's going to ever think that I'm sick enough unless I'm at death's door. So today I'm doing stupid things that Might literally put me at death's door.  Not right away of course but quicker than I can get the help I need. I'm so frustrated with myself because it's like I'm wanting to be light-headed and dizzy today and I feel like I deserve to be and when I'm not getting light-headed like I have been for the past week, I feel like I'm not sick enough and I don't deserve the help that I know in my logical mind that I truly need. My feelings are really playing Havoc with my wise mind and logical mind. But then they always do. Big sigh. I just don't know what to do anymore. I've thrown this on God and I know he'll help me get through this , and I'm still hurting big time. I feel defective, like a total disaster, and like I'm always going to be on this Merry-Go-Round ride in and out of hospitals for the rest of my life. That nothing is ever going to get better in this system of things. I'm so sick of this. If those places don't accept me, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Because I basically called the only places that accept my insurance. Hopefully, if they don't Neda can give me other resources that I couldn't find on my own. I'm just tired of doing this. I wish someone would do this work for me like my therapist or my psychiatrist. Kind of thought that's what they were supposed to do. I've been doing all the work my entire life and I'm tired. I just want someone to take care of me for once. And I know it's not going to happen but I still want it. We never stop hoping for a mommy. Someone to take care of us when we're sick. I never thought when you're sick that you're supposed to take care of yourself. And yet that's what I've done ever since I was four. I'm 43 now and I'm exhausted. Because basically, I've been sick since I was 12. Mentally sick that is. and the times that I was physically sick when I was growing up I still had to take care of myself. Is it any wonder I'm so messed up?

164,alwaysthinking,08/19/2019,"Not ""sick enough"", and I want to give up","I'm so discouraged and so frustrated and just so, so ... I received a call back from two out of the three eating treatment centers today. One of them recommends PHP for me which is not possible because there is none in my area that accepts my insurance. The other one says since it's all trauma-related I need to seek out a trauma Treatment Center. Well that would be lovely except that my doctor said that if I'm not eating properly then no trauma treatment Center is going to touch me with a ten-foot pole. I'm so frustrated because I feel like I'm constantly getting the runaround and that everybody is telling me go to somebody else. And the one trauma Treatment Center that I did try a few months back said that I've been in too many hospitals so they can't help me. Can't help me? So what does that mean that I can't be helped? What does that mean for me? Let me in there is no help for me? What am I supposed to do then? I'm so frustrated and scared and I feel so helpless and  beginning to feel hopeless as well.

165,AstoriaHeaven,08/14/2019,I am struggling with my recovery,"The truth is I have never truly recovered from anorexia nervosa. My anorexia just has changed into binge eating disorder. I've gained weight only because on some days I was binging. But then on the others I ate even less then during the time I was anorexic. And on that days I thought that I should stop starving as I remembered my heart pounding in my chest before and I went to eat something. And than I binged. Sometimes it's not even that much - normal amount of food but I could feel I was binging. And it still is that way. I know I should try just eating enough, but I can't. It hurts me so much because it's not logical is not smart and I hate it. But I also hate my body - when I look at my stomach I wanna cry, I wear male shirts in a certain size (it's far from my actal size), I can't stop covering my body with blankets, especially when someone sees me, even if is so hot that I can't stand it... And I know why I eat like that. I am depressed. Nothing is intresting. And then food maybe is. I am on medication. I've told my psyciatrist about my ED and she's just dismissed it because my weight is appropriate for me. And I don't really want to draw attention to it again because I feel like I want to go back to being anorexic. It's so messed up and illogical that I hate this statement.

169,supertaster,08-10-19,Can't eat fruits or vegetables- ARFID?,"I'm 21 years old and I hardly ever consume fruits or vegetables. I'm extremely ashamed of this and have tried to change my eating habits, but can never follow through. It seems irrational to say this but I feel a lot of anxiety about trying to consume fruits and vegetables. I've experienced so much shame and self-loathing for this behavior, so when I heard about ARFID, I felt some hope that maybe this isn't my fault and that it's out of my control. I don't know if I meet all of the criteria for ARFID, though. I'm a healthy weight and lab tests indicate that I don't have any serious nutritional deficiencies. But I'm certain that my diet is affecting my health, and it may explain my weak immune system and low energy. I'm worried that more serious health problems will arise in the future. It also affects me socially, although I try to hide my shame behind self-deprecating humor. I experience a lot of anxiety about eating out or at dinner parties, because I'm worried I'll be served a salad and I don't want to make a scene. Could this be ARFID? I'm desperate to fix my diet, but maybe I should be treating it as an eating disorder rather than a matter of pickiness or stubbornness.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,08/13/2019-12:56pm",Welcome! ,"Hello, thank you for posting!

170,oooof358,05/20/2019,Worried about bulimia health complications :(,"Hey, I just joined this site and would love some advice! Some background: I’m 18 years old, and have been struggling with bulimia for about a year and a half now. During my junior year of high school, I was diagnosed with rumination disorder. It evolved into bulimia when I began to improve stress-wise, but couldn’t get used to keeping down food again. Now I’m in my last week of senior year, and my family thinks that the use of eating disorder behaviors is still because of the rumination disorder, so it’s been pretty easy to hide. On the surface, I’m at a good place in my life. I’m working two jobs that I love and trying to make it in the restaurant industry, hopefully as a cook someday (kind of in conflict, because I love cooking and food studies, but food is also obviously a huge stressor for me.) I know I won’t be able to succeed without recovering, but I have no idea how to open up to anyone without jeopardizing my jobs, friendships, and family relationships. I’m also starting college next year on a full scholarship, and I’m scared that being sick is going to screw it all up for me. I’ve been noticing some health problems in the last few months that could be linked to bulimia. I keep having a dull pain in my left shoulder that spreads down my arm, which made me drop two dishes at work last night. I’ve also had pretty consistent tightness in my chest and trouble breathing, a low temperature, and just general feelings of weakness and exhaustion (especially over the last week, when purging has been especially severe.) Has anyone else had similar problems, and if so, did you see a doctor? I don’t feel like I can tell anyone I’m bulimic, but I’ve heard stories about scary complications and I’m really not trying to die right now.Thank you for reading, any response helps!",_admin_moderator,"Mon,05/20/2019-3:28pm","Dear oooof358, welcome to","Dear oooof358, welcome to NEDA Forums!

The only difference is the anorexia monster that almost killed me has been reborn as bulimia. Last night I was up until 4am, ordering delivery from multiple sources, and using behaviors. I'm really destroying myself.  i had to be at work by 6.But I went through recovery. I went to inpatient care. There was a time after that I really was taking care of myself. I don't think I have the willpower to do it all again. I need help snapping out of this really bad phase. I just needed to say it out loud, even if to the void.

172,wheredyougobern...,08-07-19,lies,"I have been in treatment for over a year and a half now, started in PHP and  have been struggling in outpatient for about a year. I am still trying to weight restore (which is strange to type out because ""trying"" seems like the wrong word since part of me still doesn't want to be doing this at all) and have a lot of ED thoughts constantly throughout the day.
But- I feel like finally in the last few months I have been doing so much better. My weight has slowly been moving in the right direction and I am open to so much more food wise and emotion wise. However, there is one big lie i've harped on and I know ED lives off of lies. A long time ago I thought my period had come back (it had been gone for a year or so) but I quickly realized that wasn't the case, but I knew it was a ""good"" thing so I didn't admit it wasn't true, and to make things worse I've kept up the rouse that I've had a regular cycle for a few months.
I feel so torn because I know this is in no way a good thing to be doing but at the same time, I feel like Im doing so well in other areas that my ED is convincing me to keep up this lie.  I know what I SHOULD do, which is be honest, but I don't know how to get myself to do it.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,08/07/2019-5:22pm",Welcome! ,"Hi, thank you for posting!

My mom is going to be in there with me so even if I wanted to say something, she would be there to say i’m ok and shoot me down. On a more positive note, there is this guy at my swimming and not going to lie, he’s been making me feel so much better and I think I might have feelings. Sorry, I needed to get that out haha. Possibly a new support??? I’ve told him the things my mother said to me and he goes through the exact same thing. Just I doubt he is suicidal or anorexic.

177,thursdaygirl,08-02-19,might start therapy?,"hi there, i'm new here! this is something that i literally never talk to anyone about (even though i very much need/want to) so i want to spew out my whole story to see how it feels. please reply if there's anything you would like to reply to :)my whole family is bigger (which is fine obviously). i spent my childhood eating unhealthy food and a LOT of it. i ate significantly more than my friends and weighed significantly more than them. i never really cared too much about it though. i'm not sure when the binge eating started but i'm assuming when i was in about fifth grade or so. i just loved food. i loved it so much and i didn't want it to go away--i always wanted there to be more. it instantly made me feel GOOD. i'm not sure if i was treating the food as a means of comfort so much as a means of pleasure, like a drug. i’m sure the two roles are intertwined somehow—I just know it felt so good.when the binging started to get really severe, that's when i began engaging with bulimia. i was 15 or 16. i remember working at a food chain for 8 hour shifts and eating our products that whole time, and then purging in the staff bathroom with the faucet running. after i got off, i would drive to a fast food place right before it closed, eat a huge meal plus dessert, purge, and then go to bed. this type of behavior continued into college. it's all a blur and kind of went on-and-off but i was purging close to every day for a couple years. it wasn't necessarily ""working"" in the way i wanted it to though--freshman year of college i was at my biggest. i know we're not supposed to post weight on here so i'll say i was definitely a big girl but not like, wildly overweight.in the middle of my sophomore year, my roommate started going to the gym (a place i never had been) and i tagged along once. idk what happened but i've been working out pretty much ever since. this was about a year and a half ago; i'm 20 years old now. i lost a bunch of weight. since then, i've been getting a lot of compliments and male attention. people are nicer to me but i could be imagining that. it's crazy how differently people treat me after the weight loss-- mostly strangers but also people i've known for a while as well. their eyes stay on me much longer. i must have been addicted to that, as i'm addicted to a lot of other things, because i've become quite obsessive about my eating in a more restrictive way.i've been pretty orthorexic in the past year or so. please forgive me with the terminology--i've never been diagnosed with anything as i've never really talked to anyone about this. it's terribly embarrassing and shameful to me for some reason, and i'm usually good about talking about tough subjects and knowing that not being neurotypical doesn't make you ""crazy"". it's all very contradictory to the whole way i present myself, which is extremely confident, carefree, and bold. it's all really such a bummer.back to the current state of my orthorexia/disordered eating. i binge from time to time of course, though what i consider a ""binge"" is less forgiving now and is sometimes what would be another healthy person's meal. i don't usually make myself throw up anymore because i'm terrified that the act of vomiting will eclipse the functionality of my birth control pill. however, if i've been drinking heavily, i will almost always make myself throw up as a ""free pass."" i do not miss the days of knowing where the single stall restrooms are located in every building; it made me feel crazy. but now i think i feel a new kind of crazy, still surrounded by some of the same stress, guilt, and compulsion.food is just extremely difficult for me right now; it's not easy. the way i shop for groceries is very restrictive: no desserts, very little carbs, no meat, no dairy, etc. i check the calorie counts on everything and want them to be very, very low. i even stopped buying one of my favorite foods and relatively healthy one, you would think. i kept binging on them, eating big bags of them in a day or whole jar over 2 or 3 days. i'm hoping my days play out so that I'll be able to skip a couple meals. i usually try to go as long as i can without eating before getting super hungry at night, and then i'll ""give in"". i'm also biking everywhere, trying to stay fit.what i hate is how extreme it is. food is simultaneously repulsive and arousing to me: i can think it is a deadly sin or god's greatest gift. there's just so much anxiety and thinking surrounding my food, in a way that isn't mindful--more disordered and obsessive. i also HATE the way my weight loss/history with ED's has made me look at other women's weights. from my friends and family to strangers, i'm always clocking people's weights, something i never used to do before the last year or so. i can't tell you how often i'll see a woman holding an unhealthy food item and think ""that's why she looks like that"", which is SO toxic and mean. if i see a woman who's thinner than me, i get jealous immediately, which i also hate. if i see a thin woman eating something unhealthy (or even worse, a thin woman repeatedly eating unhealthy food regularly without gaining weight), i get very jealous, maybe even mad.why i chose to write this post is because i feel crazy and i know i'm not. i'm a really smart and thoughtful young woman who unfortunately has a bit of mental illness when it comes to eating. it's just getting really disordered, and i had a bit of a rough week. it's friday now. last friday night, i went out with my friends (after not having eaten all day). when i woke up i was in the guy i've been seeing's bed, but i had no recollection of getting there. it was such a gross and scary feeling. i usually don't black out from alcohol like that. i had to go to work at 9 AM that saturday morning. once i got there, i felt okay at first and started drinking water. even after something like that happening, when i clearly needed food, i denied myself lunch. i felt like shit and had to take a ""bathroom break"" to physically lie down because i felt so week and sick. but i felt skinny. i ate at night and then my sister came into town the next morning. we walked a few miles (my idea of course) to this restaurant she really wanted to try. i fainted in the line at the counter once we got there. to be fair, it was very hot outside. but what if she wasn't there? actually, just what if someone who didn't love me undeniably wasn't thereafter our day together we went on a 4-day nature trip up in michigan. i binge ate the entire time. i don't know exactly why...probably a mix of triggers, boredom, my sister's eating habits and their influence, comfort, anxiety, the prolonged period of restriction beforehand, etc. but i feel crazy after my rough week, my rough few years.",_admin_moderator,"Sat,08/03/2019-1:06pm",Welcome!,"Hi thursdaygirl, thank you for posting on the NEDA forums!

178,Notlivingthedream,07/31/2019,Sick or health conscious?,"I am having a hard time accepting I have an issue, but logically I know I do. I have lost a significant amount of weight this year and am now on the border of being underweight. I calorie count absolutely everything I eat. I avoid social situations because I get anxious about eating and not knowing the calories in the food, I also get very anxious eating in front of other people. I know I am borderline underweight, but I still feel that I need to lose more weight. I just don't feel thin. I work out several days a week. I also started training for a half marathon, but truly I hate running but I know it burns a lot of calories and I keep telling myself it's good for my health. Many coworkers/friends/family members have voiced their concerns about my weight loss, but I just deflect and say I am at a healthy weight and explain that I work out a lot. My boss has voiced concern numerous times because the weight loss is really noticeable and she sees that I don't eat very much while I'm at work (I work 24 hour shifts). I am getting very frustrated and upset because I am getting comments daily on my weight. I know these comments are out of concern, but it's frustrating because I don't see myself as thin like everyone else is saying. I don't feel that I am ""wasting away."" The comments are really getting to me. I opened up to my OB about my preoccupation with my weight, and she highly recommended I talk with a therapist. I resisted and she said if I lose any more weight I really have to go talk with someone. That was almost X lbs ago. I have made an appointment with a counselor several times. The first time I convinced myself I was fine so I subsequently cancelled the appointment. The past two times I requested an appointment they were scheduled on days that I work (and leaving work for an appointment isn't possible). I have sent another request for an appointment, I'm sure the next available appointment is several months out though. I don't feel ""sick"" so I feel that I can manage this on my own. I keep telling myself I will start maintaining my weight instead of losing, but I just can't bring myself to do it. I am not underweight so I feel that my eating isn't a huge issue. My boss wants me to make an appointment with an eating disorder clinic near me, but when I called they said the initial appointment is 3 hours and that just seems overkill. And honestly, I'm not willing to do inpatient or extensive outpatient. I may be willing to do counseling once a week, but I'm not doing anything more than that. Plus, I don't want an official diagnosis on my chart. Sometimes I feel like I have an issue, but other tines I just feel that I am just a health conscious person.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,08/01/2019-5:31pm",Welcome! ,"Hello! Thank you for posting.

183,midwestinthecity,07/27/2019,Finally accepting it...and scared of it,"Hey everyone, After months of counting calories and feeling anxiety from going over a certain amount of calories a day, I have finally filed a request to talk to a dietician about how I feel. I have not been clinically diagnosed with an eating disorder, however, I know the signs and symptoms and am unsure who to talk about this for the time being....Today was the breaking point. I woke up this morning and immediately went to the gym. Healthy, yes? That's what I believed. I felt so good about myself. I fueled my body with breakfast I weighed in order to do the hour-long workout class I had signed up for. Once the class was over, I was exhausted. My legs felt weak and I began to feel hungy. But why was I hungry? I thought to myself, ""I just ate over  2 hours ago. I can't eat yet"". So I forced myself to walk on the treadmill at an incline for an hour until I burned off the equivalent amount of calories I knew my pre-determined lunch would be. Once I got home, I ate my lunch. After an hour, I was still hungry...but I wouldn't let myself eat. It was 3pm and I would not let myself start thinking about making dinner until at least 5pm (since I figured that would take an hour and 6pm would be the perfect time to eat). I knew what I was craving though, and the high protein content of that food makes me feel less guilty about the consuming that many carbs in a meal. So I cooked what I was craving...and I just stared at it. The calories. I couldn't get myself to do it. I wanted it so bad but I felt like I didn't deserve it. Why should I ruin all of the work I did at the gym. I stared and thought of reasons as to why I shouldn't let myself make that for dinner for over an hour while I drank water to suppress my appetite. Coming up with excuses for not making it Once it hit 6pm, I finally went to the store and picked up items that looked good, or at least equavalent to the dinner I had wanted. I looked at the label of each item of food I wanted. I did this so many times that I eventually left the store with nothing in hand, so frustrated at myself for feeling like I didn't deserve to eat. When I knew I needed to eat. I was offically denying my natural hunger because I was scared to eat. It was at this point that I began to tear up and cry at the feeling of weakness I felt and the voice in my head that I was so easily giving into. After a while, I walked to the whole foods up the road and wondered around the hot bar of beautiful food. I knew I was tortuing myself as I looked at the food, wanting it, but knowing the whole time I wouldn't let myself take it home. I love their food and that's why I forced myself to look at it. Looking and admiring the foodAfter 45 minutes of looking at the isles of food, I finally settled on accepting a frozen meal for dinner. This, somehow, I felt like I deserved. But I wasn't happy. I wasn't proud of myself. I still felt weak and I even teared up as I ate it, knowing I was letting some uncontrollable voice guide my life.This is a daily thing. It is only when I allow myself to drink that I will binge on every and all food I see and then feel guilty about eating the next day. Because of this, I am not underweight. I know there is something wrong. I have seen and talked with people with ED's before but never did I expect how easily and quietly it could happen to me. I finally called my mom and told her the feelings I was having and she just said ""why can't you eat calories??"" ""just eat the calories. you're body needs them!"" ""You should be having at least a certain amount a day-that's not that hard"". And of course, I couldn't explain to her why I could not allow myself to eat above a certain amount and why I felt a sense of power by remaining at as little calories as possible at the same time. Why that made me feel accomplished. I know I need to see a doctor, I want to. But I am scared to accept that there is something wrong with my behavior and that I will lose the control I feel over my body. If someone has any words of advice of how to get over this fear of finally accepting that something needs to change, please let me know. They would be greatly appreciated.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,07/28/2019-9:42pm",Welcome!,"Hi midwestinthecity, welcome to the NEDA forums. We're glad you're reaching out for support by posting.

184,ape130,07/29/2019,The struggle,"Hey everyone, I'm new on here. After my therapy session today I felt like I needed some extra support so I'm hoping this will be helpful. My ED behaviors and restricting got significantly worse the past week. I had a few triggering events previous as well.  My dietitian, at our last session, reacted in a way that made it harder for me. She tried turning me ed behaviors into a silly joke and said things like ""Well why not continue restricting until Aug, until Sept? Why stop there?"" She also said if I don't work harder then the treatment team will get tired, which I interpreted to mean they will give up on me. Today my therapist created a plan to follow and wants me to start right away at eating 100% of my meal plan when I haven't been following it more than 60% or less in the last several months. I am feeling overwhelmed, lost, and alone.  My therapist told me to be fierce against Ed. But it took me 2 hours to even drink one boost. I don't know if I can do what she's asking me to do. Ed tells me that I am strong when I restrict, that I'm in control. That my body is mine.  That nobody can take that away from me, and that's comforting in a way because of my abusive background. I guess I'm just reaching out to you for any who can validate or relate or has gone through some of these feelings of being afraid to let go of the eating disorder?",_admin_moderator,"Mon,07/29/2019-8:42pm",Welcome!,"Hi, ape130!

185,jeansweater,07/29/2019,I'm New - Self Diagnosing BED,"Hello...I think I have binge eating disorder although I have not been formally diagnosed. I find myself eating way too much when I am not physically hungry, and it's like a frenzy - I can't seem to stop even though I logically know what I'm doing isn't normal. Most of the time I do this binge eating at night but as I have been out of work for two weeks now, it's become a daytime hobby. I will stuff myself to the point of over-fullness and still reach for more. The hard part is figuring out what is triggering this behavior because I feel like if I knew the reason ""why"" I'm doing it, I might be able to control it better. Yes, I have stress (don't we all?), yes money is tight (nothing new there) and yes, I could point to a few things in my past that I'm probably not ""over"" but compared to some, I've had it pretty easy and have no reason to complain. My new job starts next week, my first grandchild is due within the month, life is really not so bad. I cannot afford therapy right now as I will be losing my insurance in a month so I was hoping that by coming on here, I might gain some insight and practical tips for stopping the binge before it starts or maybe learn how to figure out why I am doing this.

i've been struggling with my eating disorder for years now. i don't know if i can name a disorder because i don't feel like i fit the guidelines, which makes recovery harder. my eating disorder started when my life was hectic and i was looking for something i could control. i became obsessed with calories, how much i weighed, how much weight i could lose, and how few calories i could eat and still survive.and i feel like because i was never a ""typical"" eating disorder case, i wouldn't be taken seriously by my family or any healthcare providers.  i was always slim, i never felt fat in my life, and have never dealt with any fatphobia like many others have with eating disorders. because of this, my many attempts of recovery alone have failed and i still don't know if i feel comfortable talking to family about my struggles, so why not join this forum? this whole post is a mess, but if anyone has any advice towards feeling invalid for not being the textbook eating disorder case, i would love to hear it xx",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/24/2019-6:40pm",Welcome! ,"Hi, gottagetbetterdahlia!

I went to a diet program and lost weight.  I was hospitalized for anorexia and released at X lbs.  This is when I was 17.  I gained weight again.  In the span of about 10 years I got down to X lbs.  Then over the last 13 years I've gained to X.  This started when I was 16 and here I am at 54 years old and still struggling.  I feel so fat and ugly.  I work out a lot but my weight keeps creeping up and I don't know why.  I basically eat the same exact thing every day.Now I am ashamed and embarrassed and feel fat and ugly.  After 36 years of this I just want to not worry. I've been through so much therapy.  I am still in therapy.I weigh myself every day.  It's better than it used to be.

I’ve had disordered eating my entire life. I was in treatment for anorexia as a teen and young adult and went to the opposite extreme and probably had BED for awhile. I’ve gained and lost weight twice now. I either binge/purge and restrict and maintain a normal weight, or I just straight binge until I’m so fat I hate myself even more. Right now I’m trying to stop purging for another pregnancy. I’m struggling. I’m so anxious and depressed. I’m thinking about going to see my GP. I saw her earlier this year but didn’t mention my issues. She only knows I have ptsd but I’m not in therapy or anything. I don’t even know how I will find time for therapy. My bloodwork came back normal other than iron deficiency do I don’t think I’ve done much damage. My disordered thoughts are telling me I should drop weight before going so I’m sick enough. I’m worried I’m going to out myself as a nutcase without getting help. The last time I tried his the doctor (not the same one) said “you don’t look like you have an eating disorder”.

193,Laowai,07/20/2019,Will purging damage dental crowns?,"Hi guys,For the past few years, I have been suffering from severe bulimia nervosa which, among other things, damaged my teeth. Over the past year though, I have managed to reduce its intensity by about 99%, but I think I will never be able to get rid of it entirely.I would like to fix my teeth with zirconia crowns, supposedly the toughest kind there is. Does anyone have experience or know would occasional vomiting chip or round the edges of these dental crowns?The reason I ask is because I had my teeth fixed before with composite resin fillings, but they got chipped/rounded at the edges. Composite resin fillings are supposed to be resistant to stomach acid, so my concern is that the fillings did not get chipped due to acid exposure, but due to the mechanical force/friction of the food coming out. Does anyone know if zirconia crowns could withstand this?",_admin_moderator,"Sun,07/21/2019-6:16pm",Welcome!,"Hi Laowai!

194,Lanacarey01,07/20/2019,different kind of eating disorder... ,"so this is my very first post. I’m a 17 year old girl and I struggle with an eating disorder that I’ve never heard of before until now. just for some quick backstory, I am VERY skinny. I've always weighed a lower amount. all the women in my family have told me that when they were young, they were incredibly skinny like me. they had super fast metabolisms and didn’t actually put on weight until their mid 20’s or after their first child. my mother said she was never as skinny as me though. I was bullied a lot in middle school for my weight or having no chest. entering high school it stopped and the only person that bullies me about it is myself now. the thing about my appearance is, I don’t look super unhealthy. yes I’m very skinny and obviously by just looking at my arms you can tell, but like for instance I have a small thigh gap but nothing too abnormally large. anyway. I have always been picky about food. some food I won’t touch or eat because of the smell or because I know there’s a certain ingredient I don’t like in it. but I still eat. I’m not cautious about gaining weight at all and I eat the fast food I love constantly. my metabolism burns through everything at such a high rate, I don’t gain a single ounce from the food I eat. over the past month or so, I fell hard into my depression again for personal reasons and started eating less -out of being lazy and wanting to sleep all day. this caused my stomach to shrink so much to the point that I could only eat half a meal and be absolutely stuffed. I want to keep my weight. I’m so tired of waiting for the moment and I know at this rate I will drop to under a specific weight. I can’t eat huge meals anymore and whenever I do I go hours before I’m hungry again. It kills me everyday when I realize it happening and I feel myself becoming skinnier every single day. If anyone has any really good advice or a similar story that I can relate to please let me know. I hate not being able to control this and I would love some feedback. ( also fyi, I do drink protein shakes occasionally and that helps but it took my appetite from me )",_admin_moderator,"Sun,07/21/2019-6:09pm",Welcome!,"Hi Lanacarey, welcome to the NEDA forums.

199,izzybkn13,07/17/2019,Feeling Very Ambivalent Regarding Recovery,"I feel so unsure about what I want regarding whether or not to recover. The reasons I’d want to recover are so that I can feel better emotionally and also have better physical endurance and health. But then, I get so terrified of gaining weight — especially all of the weight I’ve recently lost. My disorders have been different throughout the years, where I started off with emotional eating and binging at a very young age, then when I was 11-13 I was very restrictive with my food intake and lost a lot of weight. Then from ages 14-18, I began to binge a lot and gained an immense amount of weight. In the summer of 2017, I was away at college for the first time and began to restrict heavily again and exercised a lot. I ended up going home in September and overate and binged the worst I had. I then entered treatment for BED, where I was then diagnosed with bulimia non-purge (due to other behaviors). I was at the residential treatment center for three months and I was able to regulate my eating again. In August of 2018, I heavily relapsed into disordered eating but this time it was restricting again. Since then, I’ve been very heavily restricting and have lost a good amount of weight. I have a therapist and two dietitians (one who meets with me at home and the other who I see at her office) and I’ve been trying to embrace the recovery mindset but I’m so incredibly scared to do so. I’m scared that if I begin eating the required amount of food, that it’ll lead me to bingeing again and that I’ll gain all that weight back and more.

202,fightingbee,07/15/2019,Rapid weight gain - is it normal? I don't know how to deal.,"Hi, this is my first time posting in a forum, but right now I'm very glad to have this opportunity. Last week I started inpatient treatment for a restrictive eating disorder. I have lost quite a considerable amount of weight since December, was admitted to a hospital at the end of June to slowly start the refeeding process and am now working towards recovery in this specialised unit. I don't really have a problem with the eating, however something I'm currently struggling a lot with is the rate of my weight gain. Since I arrived 5 days ago, I have been gaining X each day. I really feel like my body is ""broken"". We are supposed to be gaining X per week - not per day and I seem to be the only one who gains this rapidly (even though I'm on the smallest intake amount while most of the other patients are eating more and still gaining more gradually) Is this normal or even possible? Is this real weight or could it also be water? I do have slightly swollen ankles and swollen cheeks in the morning. However it is not too extreme. Will the weight maybe go down again after a while or will it continue going up so quickly? I also have a lot of mental hunger (physically I'm stuffed) but am too afraid to ask for an increase because that would mean gaining even more. I already feel huge compared to the other patients who have been here for a few weeks or even months and are still thinner than me. Can anyone help me or give me some advice on how to handle my thoughts, fears and the feeling of not being sick enough/ inferior to the other girls that are really ""sick""?

205,rhysbun,07-09-19,Scared of going into recovery and vacation,I got referred to a recovery clinic a month ago and I’m going to the information session next week. I’ve been so scared and it sent my ed into overdrive because I felt like I needed to restrict as much as possible before entering recovery but now a few days after the informatoon session I’ll be travelling to go visit my partner. We have so many fun ideas to do together and they want to take me to a fancy dessert place and an amusement park to try a dessert option since I’ve never had one before so I keep restricting in anticipation and don’t know how to stop. I’m scared of getting refeeding syndrome while I’m there and scared of not having control over cooking everything myself. I don’t know what to do. I know I’ll have them there to support me and they said that if there’s anything they can do to help that they will which is wonderful but its still terrifying. Has anyone gone through anything similar? Does anyone have any advice to get out of this and feel safe and ok? I have ocd too and it feels like I’m going to be punished.,_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/10/2019-5:47pm",Welcome! ,"Hi, rhysbun! Thank you for posting!

206,Cassidy2332,07-08-19,Restricting/ bingeing and body image pressure,"I struggle pretty seriously with eating and over exercising to compensate. I'm afraid to eat over X calories a day, yet I workout X times a week. In the last 2 months I've noticed that by the end of the day I'm so hungry that I binge. I'll eat around X during a binge like it's nothing. I feel like absolute shit after and tell myself I won't do it again, but the cycle continues. I don't know how to stop it or exactly why I'm even doing it in the first place, but having body dysmorphia doesn't help. I'm constantly looking at my body in the mirror to make sure I don't look chubby. Everyone always tells me that I'm skinny, but I have no idea what they see. I don't know how I got this way and I'm afraid to admit to anyone that I'm struggling. Everyone thinks I'm just really into fitness and eating healthy because I played sports my whole life and I'm a vegetarian, but they have no idea what's really going on in my head. I'm afraid to admit to someone that I need help, even though I want it, but at the same time I'm afraid if I do seek help I'll end up gaining weight and hating myself even more than I do now.

208,AdrianKJ,07-05-19,My Parents Control the Grocery List,"Hello.  I've been seriously thinking about getting help from a therapist, since recovering on my own hasn't really worked very well.  The only thing is, I haven't really told anyone what I'm going through.  My mom knows I used to struggle mildly with disordered eating (haha it was a lot more than that mom) but that's only because she accidentally saw a notification from one of the facebook ED groups; everyone else has no clue, and actually believes the opposite.The thing is, my dad and step-mom are incredibly triggering to be around when it comes to food.  I don't think I can remember a time when one or both of them weren't dieting, and they constantly make comments about themselves and about ""temptation foods"".  They even have there allowed calorie intake posting on the door of the fridge.  Now that I'm older, some of those comments have turned to me.  My dad recently gave me a lecture on how ""if you eat the way you do now when you're 20, you'll balloon upwards"", and, whenever I write the grocery list, they very pointedly ask if I would like to add anything, and why I haven't written any healthy food or stuff I can meal prep.The thing is, it's not like I eat mcdonalds every day or something.  Primarily, I eat specific foods which, according to them, is way too much carbs.  And the worst part is, I'm stuck at my dads house for the rest of the summer.It's honestly getting to be too much; I've already relapsed twice just in the month that I've been here.

I’ve been struggling a lot lately. I’ve been substituting drugs, cigarettes and caffeine for food. I haven’t eaten or slept in four days  and I’m starting to get really depressed. I’ve been struggling with self-harm a lot recently; yesterday I enacted in some specific self-harm behaviors. I think I’m crazy are about to be!
 I’m stuck in this vicious cycle That revolves around my body image food and drugs stemming from my low self-esteem and I’m sure when I was younger training for the Olympics in  gymnastics  getting weighed in every day and then being called fat by your coaches and teammates didn’t help either.

214,chloetxng ,07-02-19,Binge eating problem?,"Hello, I am new to these forums and I was wondering if I could get some advice or at least a reply to my problems. I have always felt insecure about my body and the way I look and it sounds very stereotypical for a typical teenager but it doesn’t matter. It started a year ago when I would start restricting the amount of food I ate and would skip meals. My memory about the past is hazy but I think I started to eat normally for a bit after. A few months ago I started restricting again, like skipping breakfast. My mum found out I was skipping breakfast and started making me eat it again so that’s that. I’ve started eating more but i’m still very restrictive about what I eat and if it’s healthy or not. My friends always comment about how I eat really healthy but they don’t know about my problems. When I started restricting, i started binge eating due to bad dieting i think. I always felt horrible after binges and I sometimes even do it in front of my friends. I’ve thought about purging but I’ve never brought myself to do it. I want to tell my mum but she has her own problems and she’s stressed. I don’t want to put more pressure on her since she has depression and she is a single mum. I’ve told one friend but he didn’t really take it seriously so I don’t know where else to turn to. Since I’ve started eating more normally, I’m not sure about the reason why I binge. Even though I constantly count calories and I’m conscious about what I eat, my diet is very healthy and I get to happily eat a few unhealthy foods, I still binge eat. It just feels very uncontrollable when I start to binge. I always control my weight and I feel depressed if I go over a certain weight. I have a few other details but I will leave it as that. I really hope somebody replies and I just want your opinion, you don’t have to give advice.

217,alwaysthinking,07-03-19,One day,"So, since someone asked how I was doing I thought I would update people on my situation. Yesterday was just awful as far as my emotional status. I felt very invalidated in group at PHP. I finally got my opportunity to talk about triggers and asking about coping with them and no one said a word except for the therapist. I do not appreciate that the group has not supported me in any way. I intend to bring it up today because I do not feel comfortable sharing in a group that is not supporting me or validating my feelings. The reason why I posted this titled one day is because I still got through the day without any eating disorder behaviors. So I took it one day at a time and I am proud of myself for doing that. So right now I'm staring at a paper that I put on my table that has a goal of no self-harm for 3 days. And when I say self-harm that includes eating disorder behaviors because I tend to use eating disorder behaviors as a substitute for other forms of self-harm because I'm constantly feeling like I have to punish myself. And then I have that if I succeed with this goal oh, I have a reward planned. So I got through yesterday without any self-harm and it helped me get in a better mood by the end of the day. Also my determination to address the situation in group has put me in a better mood. I mentioned to the group leader that I need to address this situation and she said she would read what I had written when she did her notes for the day. If she does not allow me to discuss it with in the first group at PHP, then as soon as our second group starts I am simply going to butt in as tactfully as possible and just start talking. Because this cannot happen again. Yesterday I was prepared to go to the psychiatrist and say hey you'd better put me in inpatient because I cannot be safe. That is Not therapeutic if I'm feeling that way. So I think my decision to talk to the group and hopefully get some feedback has helped me be in a better mood. Also my telling myself that despite my awful mood yesterday that I was going to eat anyway helped. I recognize that I cannot be on my A-game if I am not nourishing myself properly. So, I start the day in a good mood and hope it continues. The other thing I did for myself yesterday since I was in such a stinky Mood by the end of the day and extremely tearful was say to myself I need to do something to self soothe and I'm afraid if I go home I will not eat supper. So I took care of some paperwork that I needed to do. I went and got a massage at my gym at the HydroMassage bed, and then I went to a restaurant and ate supper there that was exactly according to my meal plan. And prior to going into the restaurant, I watched some cartoons on my phone. Which made me laugh and got me in a much better mood. So I'm starting the day in a good mood and actually looking forward to it.

219,alwaysthinking,07-01-19,Control,"So I have really slipped into entirely too many eating disorder behaviors ever since starting PHP. I know it's because I'm dealing with a lot of difficult issues. I also know it's because I'm using the eating disorder as a way to control my feelings. I also know it's really not me controlling anything but it's the eating disorder controlling me. I just wish I knew how to stop it. I intend to have a very serious conversation with either the therapist or the psychiatrist at the very next opportunity to let them know how serious this is getting. I feel like I am screaming help at the top of my lungs in the middle of a group and no one's listening. Or if they are listening they either do not care or do not want to help.  I feel like I keep getting told that I'm too sick for anyone to be able to help me. I'm back to feeling completely defective. I want to have control over my life instead of everything around me having control over me and making me feel completely out of control. I just wish I knew how to do it. I need help desperately. On a positive note I do have an appointment with a new therapist next week. Because I do not feel that my therapist but I have currently has been goal-oriented enough. I need someone that is solution and problem-solving oriented instead of just expecting me to talk about my problems all the time. I can do that with my friends. I don't need to do that with the therapist also. That's not solving anything. Don't know what I want to accomplish with this post other than just to vent.

First, its important to clarify that I come from a country where eating disorders are not very common, there are absolutely no inpatient treatment programs and no specialists in the treatment of eating disorders, Just general psychiatrists who are not very knowledgeable about eating disorders. I struggle from not being taken seriously whether by my parents or my physicians.When I first started restricting, I reached X kilograms And maintained for eight months having fainted several times and struggled from liver problems. I have since gained about X kilograms after I wanted to recover alone and started binging. Two days ago, I started restricting again. Here i am. I couldn't go back to sleep. I have the worst case of nausea and the top of my head is throbbing. I keep going in and out of the kitchen to grab some breakfast. Im so so hungry. I resist the temptation of taking a bite. I stare at my little brother while he eats his breakfast. Im so hungry that I'm literally sick to my stomach. I can't stop pacing back and forth. My vision goes black every time I stand.I hate myself so much. I hate myself for being fat. I don't want to binge. Im too weak and such a fake. Im starting to think that I made my eating disorder up when every second, something screams inside me that im so fat and unworthy and inadequate.Like.. how can I be so hungry?

I have been doing fine with my ED, still in recovery and still restoring some unwanted weight loss, due to a medical issue that seems to have healed on it's own. But I've been very depressed and struggling with issues related to my boyfriend, who is serving time in prison on a stolen car charge. I am feeling sad that we are in different head spaces with respect to our future together, and I sense he is pulling away steadily, which I cannot control or change. So I simply haven't felt like interacting with people, online and in my daily life. I've been isolating a lot and I am forcing myself out of hiding by writing here. It's never a good place for me to be when I cut myself off from people and recovery related activities, which is where I find myself now. I worry most about relapse on my drug of choice, the cravings have been increasing as I fall deeper into depression.

224,pallmalls,06/20/2019,"it's not so much about the look, it's about the control","Hi there, I'm pretty new to this and this is the first time I've ever been a part of anything like this. I have a problem though, and it's hard to reach out to anyone in my life without being too concerning. I've struggled with anorexia and bulimia a lot more when I was in high school, and before it was simple: I just wanted to be skinny. I come from an asian background, and asian moms are wildly known for always commenting on weight. also, my dad has diabetes so my weight was also in question of my health, and his fear that I would also get diabetes. I was pretty messed up in high school, safe to say I was a stereotypical burn out kid. But I managed to get my act together and I stopped obsessively working out and stopped not eating and I became healthy. a lot of people thought I became fat, but I saw it as healthy. for years since then, I've been fairly ok when it came to eating. really, my binging was the worst in college but then I became too poor to not savor every meal so I was eating fairly normally. I love to cook, especially for my friends, and I work in the restaurant/bar industry so food and going out are really a huge part of my life. but at this point, I don't know why I'm struggling again. it happened a few months ago, I didn't even notice but I would just eat one small meal a day. I was getting drunk quicker, I was getting more and more tired. once I realized what was going on I assumed the problem would correct itself but it just wouldn't. I would revel in the hunger pains, I would honestly enjoy the feeling of my stomach begging for food but me not allowing it. I'm a bigger person, not huge but I'm chubby and honestly I like it. I mean, I struggle with image issues like anyone else and I try to be happy with my body. but my issues with eating is less about my image and more about my control. the control I feel over my food and my eating habits just makes me feel strong, like I'm overcoming the pain and living through it. I had a break down a few weeks ago where a friend mine talked me through everything and I don't know what happened but something flipped and I was able to let go and eat again. but this week, I had to go to the ER because I thought I had appendicitis. I've been having these intense cramps which I thought were just abnormal period cramps. but I was really sussed out since my period came 2 weeks early (which I'm always super late) and I never get cramps. but I lived with these cramps for a week before going to the hospital. they told me it wasn't appendicitis, but it was colon issues. they still didn't know exactly what so I have to go see a doctor. which I can't even see a doctor until I see a primary care doctor to get a referral for a GI. they said it might just be an infection, or it could be IBS. I started panicking yesterday when I started looking up all the dietary restrictions with IBS. everything I can and cannot eat these lists were contradicting themselves and it became all so overwhelming. it's been over 48 hours and I have been restricting. I'm too afraid to eat for both the fear triggering my stomach, but also the control I now feel again over my body. I just feel like every time I look online to seek help, everything is always pointed towards the look of being skinny and body dysmorphia which I do have, but for once this isn't the reason for my food issues. I just want to feel a control somewhere in my life and I feel so alone in this. I feel like such a burden on my friends for my manic episodes and food issues and I just want to eat but I just can't let myself.",_admin_moderator,"Fri,06/21/2019-11:31am","Dear pallmalls, welcome to","Dear pallmalls, welcome to the forums!

227,chunkymonkey68,06/20/2019,Moving into an apartment for 1st time Brings up Past ED issues thought was Over and Done with,"Only as a freshman in college, I lost a good amount of weight from the pressure of not only taking required courses but realizing in not making top grades in some of the required courses made me focus so much on studying that I was merely grazing on snacks daily while on campus. Then my outlet at school was my chosen PE classes which gave me a way out w/o acting on harming myself as I realized that Chem 101 was really not meant for me. Then in meeting my college counselor to go over a new agenda and schedule w/ a completely new career goal in mind and totally different major coursework on my plate for the next semester was a new trigger for trying to gain Total Control over my feelings of inadequacy over certain failures happening b4 my very eyes as I experienced failure in school this was new for me. I had always been a good student. But college courses were a bit more concentrated and accelerated than my HS course work required for my HS diploma. So I began focusing on my new major course work and actually was feeling better over controlling my destiny to graduate from college, and planning to pass all transfer courses was my first and primary goal. I had a very experienced older woman as my counselor. She had earned her degree from Stanford after leaving the military of many years. She became a role model for me and she too received a degree in social science as a doctor of psychology from Stanford University. I also had disabled female college professors who had college teaching jobs and I began to wish that when I graduated from college that I could do the same. I believe most of my female professors were also retired, military employees. This too made me see that if I pushed myself hard enough that I too might be able to do the same. I built very high expectations for myself. Unfortunately, after I transferred to the regular university to focus on my upper-division major coursework I began to relapse into some bulimic behaviors. Especially after a test where my score did not reflect how hard I had studied. I would binge secretly in the same place I had studied for my tests. I did not gain weight as at the time I was also using laxatives and my weight did not reflect any signs of binges that occurred frequently in the campus library. I can't believe I actually graduated as passing certain required courses in my major,  was not always easy for me. Thank god I made it through the eye of the needle. My close friends from my community college, a few supportive men I was acquainted with were always around when I least expected them to see me on campus. My friend was an engineering major. I thought he would be way too busy to even take time out of his precious agenda to see me a few times a week when I was not working but studying at the library in the evening. My friend would whisk me away and make me go out to dinner w/ him. not sure why he was obsessing over my nutrition, but it was fun celebrating after studying. He eventually left his career as an engineer and trained as an EMT. He works at conventions as an EMT emergency float. He is married. I am still single. Life w/o a male partner is challenging for me. In my 20's I was never alone I was always going out on dates when Not in the library studying or working at my mall retail job. Life just seemed so much more fun bumming it w/ my male friends from college. Now I work in the jeans dept as CSR. I look at a certain style of jeans and occasionally reminisce back to my old school days from college.It's hard for me to be single. I resent that my x bf broke up after putting so much, time, effort and intimacy, so it seemed, into our relationship. After college graduation, my EMT's best friend was the man I had dated for almost 10 yrs b4 Not getting married but Breaking Up. I am alone now, just me and the scale, and my kitchen full of healthy foods to control my need to use laxatives. They tend to get in the way of working a job such as mine. I can't just go when i need to go, as that saying goes...Thus I am strong, I try not to eat too much, snack less than i used to when using purging behaviors. I miss my favorite brand of sweet snack which i ate at night as I avoided my former boyfriend. I worked overnight answering phones and loved my job. The man I was with seemed jealous of my overnight operator from home job. He was upset as it interfered w/ his needs. When he went out I never made him feel guilty. I stayed home and worked on my phone job, or watched tv on a night off, or went out w/ a BFF.We finally broke up a year after I had graduated from college. I was in the mid of job interviews. This was a very upsetting time for me as I was focusing on becoming hired in The Real World after my college and volunteer jobs were all completed. It was on his terms. Earlier he had acted unstable when I had wanted out of the relationship. He had threatened to kill his self if i left. I had to remain there w/ him until he finally made up his mind about our breaking up for Good.I was just upset because it was at a time where I was really focusing on my post-grad job interviews. I had to save face and left w/o any ?s asked. No groveling or leg-pulling w/ drama and tears about his decision. He had done me a favor FINALLY. As it was his decision I was happy that he wanted to break up. I was just upset that I  was interrupted while going through many local interviews. I wanted to prove to him that college was Not just a waste of my time and efforts. I wanted to show my parents too so they could have been proud of me. I couldn't get the Closure i wished for at the end of our relationship. I was angry, sad, depressed, felt used, dominated, and then discarded. I tried to end my life at that point but had even failed in controlling the end of my life and making a point to everyone that I was exhausted and tired of ALL the damn DRAMA. So I created some of my own DRAMA. I failed to end my life about 20 yrs ago. Then had to move back home and went back to my primary career which I had been doing prior to my grad studies, and all the drama...Now I live here in my own apartment w/ my relative. Life is boring and uneventful, except for when a neighbor croaks downstairs from my apartment and the police come up to question little old me. Is that even right? I'm not sure, and not sure what the officer was thinking of me when he asked of my birthdate for his records. I work hard. I am a good person. I help out in my community as needed. I work hard. I work 2 pt jobs as I never did land an ideal FT job w/ Benefits or anything to run home to mom n dad and brag about. I think I should have been the last neighbor round here to ask questions of, including my birthday. Not sure what the police were thinking of me at the time, but sure didn't feel very respected being chosen to question about the neighbor's death downstairs from my lil apartment. I have just taken my muscle relaxants, pain relievers, otc water pills, and just want to sleep. I still wish at times that I could go to sleep and never awaken to another day of loneliness, and having to work so hard for hardly anything. I miss the old friends or acquaintances whom I believed were my true friends. Funny, most of my girlfriends who seemed so strong, independent, and stable ended up being total strangers later on in life to me. They seem to really depend on the domestic way of life and are nothing like their older, more feminist, stronger former female selves from college. I feel like I haven't changed that much. I am loyal to myself and my values. I remained myself in spite of all the drama I have had to put up with so far in my life. I could ramble on but this is it for now.Good night to all and Make the best of your life as u only have 1 life and 1 chance to appreciate the life given to you.

228,kellyjliu,06/20/2019,Recovery and Relapse?,"My freshman year in college was when my eating disorder really started to take over me. Insecurity and body image issues were always a problem. Before I had went a few months restricting but got myself out of it. This time around I had a clean slate. Without the intention of actually losing weight, I saw college as a chance to get ""fit"". I wanted to go to the gym and I wanted to eat healthy. Needless to say I lost weight in just three months. Still I had no idea. I knew I got smaller (but how much?) Honestly, I never even weighed myself. It wasn't until my best friend saw me that she bought the possibility that I would have an eating disorder.I'm from Shanghai and in China, eating disorders and mental health do not get the attention that they should. Being raised that way it never occurred to me that I would have one. Anyone will a mental illness seemed so serious, so extreme and I often associated my disordered behaviors as small insecurities that everyone would have. After some time, I began to realize that she was right. I was bound to certain times of eating, certain foods, overworking my body through exercise. I had no energy, no time to see or make new friends. I was more miserable than I've ever been. And so it's taken some time and lots of courage to want to get better. Returning back to Shanghai this summer, I've somehow managed to block out all my disorder thoughts and allowed myself to eat. Because I was restricting for so long, I think I experienced extreme hunger. I would binge and snack and eat late at night, sneak my food, and not be able to stop even when eating brought me to the point of discomfort. This went well for about a month. I never weighed myself because I knew if I did it would break me. I never allowed myself to think about the weight I gained and focused rather on eating and being out, being able to enjoy time with my friends ad family. It wasn't until a few days ago my best friend came to me again. Yes, physically and mentally I seemed better. I was eating. But all I had done was avoid any thoughts related to my eating disorder. She said I should find a counsellor. That, once again, I had convinced myself that I can beat this on my own and that, once again, I will fail. It only took her a day for me to see that she was right. My first day working as an intern I got up, wanted to get changed. All my clothes that at one point fit me, then all of a sudden because oversized, starting to fit again. I did my best to brush this off. An hour later, I was standing in the elevator going up to my office. I saw my reflection in the elevator. Once again, I tried to brush these thoughts off. Later in the day, I went to the bathroom. The bathroom had a full body mirror. That is when i couldn't avoid it anymore. It was staring me right in the face. Every detail that I noticed was all wrong and there was no escaping it. I was ashamed, disgusted, grossed out and all I wanted to do was go home, hide and cry. This was yesterday. I realize although I hope a better future is ahead, right now, the only way for me to feel good about myself is for me to starve and be skinny. Yes I had so many problems when I was smaller. My hair fell out, I was weak, I always felt like fainting, I got almost no sleep and I never got time with my friends. But one thing I never had was the insecurity. That's my biggest fear. Gaining weight and having all those self-deprecating thoughts resurface. And they are beginning to. So I guess I'm lost in my recovery right now. Because as of today I start restricting and I don't even feel bad about it. I just want my body to go back to the way it was. To stop imagining people calling me names behind my back whenever I'm in public.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,06/20/2019-12:57pm","Dear kellyjliu, we would like","Dear kellyjliu, we would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove mentions of detailed disordered eating behaviors and weight numbers, which are not allowed on the forums.

229,fannycat,06/17/2019,Just need to know I'm not alone,"This is my first time acknowledging I have a problem.  I struggled with food and eating around people when I was in my teens, and now, a couple of decades later, I am having a similar issue.  About a year and a half ago I began a new sport, which I love, and I compete in regularly.  The problem is this sport is very much dependent on weight, and to make weight, my coach has encouraged me to take measures that are difficult for me to keep under control.  I train several hours a day, and have a very regimented eating routine.  This would be fine, but now, when it is time to celebrate or be with family and friends, I can't eat.  In fact, I struggle to eat at all around anyone unless it is the very specific foods I have decided are ""OK.""This has really become a problem for me.  I didn't eat at my best friends wedding.  I have begun chewing and spitting.  When we have a team celebration I can't eat, or I pretend to eat so people don't bug me.  My coach has realized it is a problem, and has been encouraging me to eat foods that I enjoy, but I just feel guilt.  The power I feel when I am able to turn down the food I want to eat is so seductive, but then I have very little joy in my life because I can't be around people or attend parties that involve eating.  The other day I decided to eat a cookie, to prove to myself that I would not gain weight from it.  My husband walked in, and I had a panic attack.  I ended up crying uncontrollably.  Over a cookie.  I recognize that the regiment of my training and my overall enjoyment of life requires food, but I'm really struggling to enjoy it.  I am starting to feel very lonely and hopeless.

My parents basically told me if I don’t start going back to the gym then I’m not going back to school in August.

I lost that weight by dieting and eating healthy, but eventually the initial excitement of my weight loss went away and I wanted to lose more, but at the same time I missed eating unhealthy food. That's when my binging and purging began. It started out slowly--the occasional cheat meal and then some purging afterward. It didn't seem so bad at first and I started losing weight. I was eventually down X pounds from my original weight at the beginning of college and I was so happy because I finally felt beautiful and confident. I then focused my energy on eating extremely healthy and working out because I didn't feel the need to purge anymore. I didn't purge for almost 6 months because I finally found happiness. I cared so much about what people thought about me and whether or not boys found me attractive so when I was skinny and beautiful, I was content and stopped my bulimic tendencies. In the beginning of 2018, I had a falling out with my best best friend and lost a close family member all at once. My world came crashing down and even though I still had an amazing family and support system, I turned back to food to give me comfort and I fell back into my old bulimic habits. I moved into a new apartment alone, stopped hanging out with my friends, and isolated myself completely from everyone who loved me. I even started getting into drugs which further deteriorated my mental health. I even stopped attending my classes because I would eat whatever I wanted to order/could find and then would purge it all--I did that about X times a day. At first, my body did not change, but over time I started to gain more and more weight, which made me more depressed and binge/purge more. My life continued like this for a while and I became a shell of the once happy and driven person I used to be. A good friend of mine sat me down one day and explained to me how everyone was worried about me and that I needed to change if I wanted to keep my friends because if I kept pushing everyone away, eventually people would stop trying. After that conversation, I started to turn my life around and moved into a new house to get a new start. I started losing weight and eating healthy and became happy again. I stopped binging/purging and turned my focus to rebuilding the friendships I had lost. My life was finally getting better. I started turning my life around at the beginning of 2019 and so far it has been nothing but great. However, I am starting to gain weight again and I have recently started to binge/purge again. It has only been in small amounts--nothing crazy like it used to be but I am so worried about slipping back into that dark place. Nothing specific has happened to make me depressed, but I think the years of suffering from bulimia coupled with the drug use from my past has really taken a toll on my mental health. I have an amazing family, great friends, and an amazing boyfriend, but for some reason the only thing that truly makes me happy is being skinny. I know that is not a healthy mentality, but that is how I feel. I have so many people in my life who love me and support me, but I feel so alone. I have a blessed life and I should be happy, but nothing brings me joy. I don't find happiness in the things that I used to love. Working out used to be my favorite thing in the world and made me so happy, but I can't find the motivation to get back in the groove. I know that if I just force myself to get out of bed and do something active everyday I can find happiness, but I just can't bring myself to do it because I would rather lock myself in my room and binge/purge... The binging and purging only happens when I am alone and/or have too much free time to myself so I decided to get on this forum to see if anyone else can relate to my story. No one in my life understands and I just need help getting out of this rut. I don't want to be in this mental state anymore and I need advice so please, if anyone has any answers about how to break the shackles of binge eating and bulimia, let me know. I understand recovery doesn't happen all at once so I am ready to start taking baby steps because it's time for me to admit I have this problem and figure out a recovery plan.

I don’t know if I actually belong here. I took the screening tool and it said I was at risk. I’ve known for some time my relationship with food has been bad. I do suffer from mild body dysmorphia and find myself worried about my weight frequently. I am not considered underweight and definitely don’t even feel close to being so. My main problem is that I avoid eating and get terrible feelings when I do. Although I show many of the signs I hesitate to say I have a problem because some days I’ll be really happy and feel able to eat.

236,nela2012,06-11-19,My story,"I never thought I had an eating disorder, because the only eating disorders I knew about were anorexia and bulimia. For me personally, I don't worry too much about my weight, however my relationship with eating food in general is very very difficult. I get terrible anxiety just thinking about going out to dinner with acquaintances or even relatives that are not my immediate family. I don't even know how to explain it but something about eating a full meal just makes me worried and I start to feel sick or nauseous so I can never finish a full meal. It used to be a lot worse for me where I would get scared of choking on my food or having an allergic reaction to new foods. I know it is irrational but eventually I just had to start eating more anyways because I was getting so weak and tired all the time. My stomach would hurt so bad and I would get dizzy if I didn't eat. Now, I physically am capable of eating, but before, I literally could not. Now, it's still difficult for me because I get so anxious eating around people. In school, when I have to eat my lunches, I eat painfully slow and always think that someone is watching or judging how I eat. I avoid messy foods because I don't want to embarrass myself in front of people. I get major anxiety just imagining a situation like a first date, where I would have to go get dinner with a guy I like. I just get nauseous because I'm so anxious about these little things and it literally stops me from eating. I'm reading over my blog post right now and it seems so irrational, and the reasoning I'm giving for not wanting to eat because of being embarrassed just sounds so stupid, but for some reason it's just ingrained in my head. Clearly, my disordered eating has something to do with my anxiety because I just overanalyze all situations in my life like eating in social situations. I don't feel like I can talk to my parents or even my friends about it because they will judge me or think I'm weird. Or worse, my parents might get really concerned about me and I don't want to worry them. So, I'm too scared to see a doctor and I don't know what to do at this point. Eating has become a chore for me rather than something you're supposed to indulge and enjoy with other people. I honestly don't know what to do but I want to get better because this disorder is stopping me from spending time with people and growing as a person. I actually love who I am and I think I have a great personality but I get so worried and scared about these things, and at this point I'm used to either eating alone in my room or avoiding food until I can come home and eat by myself.

237,Katdancer,06-09-19,Feeling so stuck ,"I’ve been struggling with disordered eating in various forms for about 15 years. I am of a healthy weight so I feel like no one believes me that I feel so sick. I am trying to get help however I have no insurance. I finally saved enough money to afford a therapist and a nutritionist, however I recently had to stop going. I had insurance through marketplace For 5 months last year... that I cancelled because it was so bad and I knew I needed help and I couldn’t get it with insurance (ironic I know)... and I recently got a letter from the IRS stating I have to pay back the credit they paid to make insurance more affordable (at the time that I had the insurance my projected income was lower than it ended up being after taking a new job a few months after canceling) so I had to stop treatment.  Right after I stopped I started restricting again. I go through phases of deliberately restricting  and sometimes I don’t even know I’m doing it . I currently feel so exhausted, dizzy, and achy on a daily basis that it is hard for me to function some days. I have been trying to eat normally but it hurts and I feel sick unless I eat the certain things I’m used to. I feel like I’m scared to eat because I don’t know what my tummy is going to do so I restrict more. I get so bloated sometimes that If I’m doing anything with friends I use behaviors I don’t want to be bloated and feel sick. It’s sooo frustrating. I had my hunger cues somewhat normalized for a little bit  and was somewhat able to eat normally and now they are all out of whack and I don’t even get them again I just feel like my battery ran out and then I can’t eat because I feel sick and I have no energy or ambition to make food or get food so I just lay on the floor for hours wondering how much longer i can do this and what damage I’ve caused.I just need some hope or some advice anything.

242,pestopasta,06-05-19,Hello,"I've had a problem with overeating for a really long time but it has escalated in recent years.When I was still very small, probably at the age of 8, my sister pointed out that I had cellulite. I don't exactly remember what my reaction was but I most likely started to cry. As the youngest in my family, I've always been the sensitive one; I cry extremely easily in front of my family. I simply cannot cry in front of other people though. There have been times where I have tried to force myself (at funerals and such), but I simply have not been able to cry in front of someone outside of my immediate family probably for 10 years. On another occasion, my mom had put a certain kind of food into a bowl and I remember my sister took the bowl to her room. I was in 7th grade then. Later, after she had put it back downstairs, I took the bowl to my room (I sort of felt entitled to do this since my sister had taken it to her room as well) and ate almost all of the food that was inside of it. My sister eventually found out and told my mom. I remember my sister accused me of having no self control when she initially realized what I had done. This automatically made me burst into tears. My mom was quite harsh too. I wouldn't say we had a fight though because I didn't talk back to her, I just sort of sobbed as I listened to her.The first time I clearly recall having negative thoughts about my body was in 6th grade but surely it started before that. In 3rd grade, I was friends with the more spoiled, popular girls in my grade and one day one of them called be fat. Looking back on this, the girl who said this was probably projecting her own insecurities because she wasn't as thin as the other girls in our friend group either. I wasn't really fat, I was just sort of chubby. I can't remember how much it affected me or if it really made me feel insecure though.I think some time around middle school, I was in the car with my mom and my sister and they pointed out how insecure I was about my body. I can't remember what I said that elicited that response but I remember my mom acknowledged that it was partly the fault of her and my sister. I wished they would have done something about this but we never really talked about it again.I have always done some sort of physical activity to try and keep in shape which was mainly my parent's incentive. But that's not to say that I didn't enjoy partaking in these activities. For a long time (almost all of middle school) this for me was swimming. The only time I really think I was skinny was in the summer after 7th grade when I used to go to the pool a certain amount a week. Other than that, I've always considered myself a little bit chubbier than other girls. Then in 9th grade, I started going with my dad and my sister to the gym. The first couple of times I got extremely light-headed because I wasn't really used to this kind of physical effort. I was also really bad at doing any exercise that engaged my abdomen. My sister would call me weak and for the first time, this motivated me to do better, and I became the more determined of the three of us.But my issues with body image started to escalate in 10th grade when I started going to the gym only with my dad (my sister had left to collage). He took me to his own personal trainer who would weigh me on a weekly basis. I want to first acknowledge that it is a privileged to have had access to a personal trainer and that this would have been of great help to be had I been on better terms with my body. But I had never really weighed myself before because at my house we only had an old-fashioned medical scale which I didn't know how to use. He told my I was borderline overweight but I didn't feel like I was overweight and I didn't look like I was overweight and my parent disagreed with him as well. He tried to put me on a certain meal plan which I then gave to my mom. She refused to have me follow it and made my dad tell the trainer to stop trying to make me lose weight. But this really got into my head and that's when I started employing more severe methods to try and lose weight: I would engage in certain eating disorder behaviors. Needless to say, none of this worked as I could only keep it up for about a day.Around this time I also started to engage in other eating disorder behaviors as a way to cope with stress. I am generally more prone to stress than most of my peers. In the past year, I struggled with eczema and psoriasis. My mental health is also not the best and I struggle with seasonal depression due to the passing of three very close members of my family over the last two years. So it was quite natural for me to begin to seek comfort in food. When I would stay up later than my parent to work on and assignment, It was always a given that I would engage in certain eating disorder behaviors. It was usually was food that I found comfort in. But it wasn't really so severe. I wouldn't eat everything in one sitting and I wouldn't eat till I was painfully full. Realistically, I wasn't actually eating because I was stressed, I was eating because I was alone and because I was free of my family's perceived judgement, of course this didn't actually exist. But I have only now began to see this.Then, last summer, I lost a certain amount of weight from July to around October by eating a certain amount of calories every day. I adored how I looked and I was extremely proud of myself. This may have been a result of the fact that when my sister had come home for summer break, my parents praised her for how much weight she had lost. I remember my dad saying something along the lines of ""If you put in the work, maybe one day you'll look like your sister,"" but didn't say this this in a condescending way though, it was meant more as an encouragement. As a result of my drastic weight loss, I lost my period for 5 months. This reaped havoc on my hormones as I was simply trying to speed up the process of puberty. My skin was terrible and my appetite had completely disappeared. There were days in which I would engage in certain eating disorder behaviors all day.

243,lovaas,05/31/2019,Extreme food cravings and binges ,"I've slipped into anorexia for the first time about 4-5 years ago, but managed to come out of it by myself and regain almost all of my weight after a couple of years. However I only now recognize that I've probably never fully recovered mentally, and as a matter of facts I've relapsed pretty heavily about a year ago. At first I started eliminating all sweet and junk food (I've always had a serious sweet tooth), but after restricting my meals I got into a cycle of not eating much, bingeing the junk food I was restricting, and then skipping meals because of the guilt. I tried to fix this by starting to use a calorie tracker and radically changing my diet, eliminating ALL of the junk food that was triggering my bingeing behaviour and starting to eat only what I considered ""healthy"" whole foods. Things got out of control pretty fast tho, and I've lost some weight since December now (and I was already underweight at the time), and I'm now completely addicted to calorie counting. Because of this I've contacted an health centre, but my appointment is in two weeks.However, wanting to make the first big step as soon as possible, I've stopped counting calories cold turkey and uninstalled all of my calorie tracker, while at the same time finally giving myself permission to eat whatever I want without trying to restrict and control anything. Thing is, these first few days of freedom I literally find myself obsessing over certain kinds of ""forbidden"" food that I haven't had in months, and giving into my cravings always ends up in a binge. I feel like I'm never full, never fully satisfied, even if I'm enjoying and savouring every bite I take. Am I doing the right thing or am I developing another kind of eating disorder? I'm scared that this will become a bad habit and that my body won't fix itself overtime but just keep on craving because it got used to it. Should I just take a different approach or just let myself fully go for this couple of weeks?",_admin_moderator,"Sat,06/01/2019-9:56am",Welcome!,"Hi lovaas, thank you for posting to the forums!

244,Livemylife,06-04-19,I’m new here,"This is my first attempt at recovery. I have been dealing with binge eating disorder for years now, but I’ve been in denial. I haven’t wanted to admit that I have an actual problem. My life is good on the outside, but inside I’m struggling and I figured an online forum would be a good outlet.I binge eat about once a week. I feel so out of control, and the guilt the next day is unbearable. I had an incident last week. I slept at my mom’s house and we had entirely too much to drink. I blacked out and don’t remember going to bed. I also don’t entirely remember binge eating in the middle of the night. I woke up the next day to my mom saying “don’t eat anymore food!!” She then pointed out everything that I had binge on in the middle of the night. I felt absolutely disgusted and ashamed. I couldn’t even look my mom in the eye. That was the moment that I realized maybe I do actually need help. To punish myself the next day, I ran and restricted. I couldn’t open up to my mom or boyfriend about how seriously this has affected me. And this is certainly not the first time that a binge like this has happened. I can use behaviors multiple times per week. I know that the drinking doesn’t help. I feel extremely out of control when I binge, sober or not. And the shame the next day/immediately afterwards is unbearable. It is truly starting to affect my life.I have never confessed this to anyone. I am hoping this online forum will grant me some sort of support. Hoping somebody on here can over any advice/support!

245,zenayugen,06-05-19,I'm Tired...,"Hello, This is my first time expressing myself to a platform like this. I never told the whole story to anyone because I always thought it just doesn't worth it, but ı can't do it anymore. I'm tired of trying and failing so here is my story. Maybe writing it to a forum would help me: I was a happy kid. People were telling me that I'm beautiful and I have a great physique. They were saying that I can do modelling when I grew up. For this reason, I never thought about ""gaining weight"" or any other thing until I turn into 14. I had the confidence back then and I was the cheerful person in my friend group. Ok, maybe you're going to laugh at this because it is not that serious when ı tell but all my insecurities initiated from a simple thing a girl told me ""I thought you were thin but look at your tights"". After that, I began to look at the mirror more carefully. Every time İ look at it, I was only seeing a fat girl with big tights, so I stopped eating. I was never the same and yes, as I can remember all those things started from. simple sentence. Then I went to high school. People were still complimenting me but a part of me was never believing. I never said thank you. I began to eat less and less and while I was becoming thinner people were complimenting me more. After some point, I was just telling myself, ""you are not smart, you can't sing, you can't dance, you have nothing special except your beauty. If you gain weight and lost those compliments there would be no you."" so I gave up eating certain types of food. I was telling people that I became vegetarian for animals but no. ı actually wanted to lose weight. After four years I was still struggling. My parents were always suspicious but we never talked about it. WhenI was 18 (last year) I began to engage in certain eating disorder behaviors. Every time when I came home from school with an empty stomach, I was taking a bunch of certain foods and engaging in eating disorder behaviors. After that ı was hiding the food. I didn't know what to say when my mother noticed it. How could I explain? ı just didn't want to gain weight. Do you know what hurts me the most? She started crying. My parents did nothing wrong. They were really supportive and everything but they thought. it's because of them.Even while I was crying, ı was thinking about how many calories I'm burning meanwhile but I didn't traumatize by anything. Whatever happens to me it really because of me. I couldn't tell people that I have an eating disorder. I was (I am still)  telling them that I have panic attacks due to hormonal disease. I am a liar I know. Now? I keep engaging in certain eating disorder behaviors and I gained a certain amount of weight. People stopped complimenting. I keep myself busy and trying to get better. There are things that I am good a now which is development. If ı stop engaging in certain eating disorder behaviors, EVERYTHİNG İS GOİNG TO BE FİNE.Please help me. Any advice. I'm open for anything. I just want to stop engaging in certain eating disorder behaviors and everything is going to be alright.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,06/05/2019-3:05pm",Post Edited,"Hello zenayugen, We are glad to hear that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

246,damagedgoods,05/26/2019,Not sure if I am in the right place,"Hi all, I am a 33 year old female. I have suffered from a variety of eating disorders since high school. I started purging when I was in junior high, then starving until I was hospitalized in my 20s. Then eating normally and exercising it all off until I was diagnosed with a heart arrhythmia (nothing serious, but not getting proper nutrition does this I guess). And binge eating. Currently I am in the cycle of certain eating disorder behaviors. I am a certain diet but as I am not overweight and hunger does not seem to be something my body understands, it doesn't work for me. I know a diet is the worst thing to do when in recovery but I like rules and I am so out of control when I binge that I feel like i need strict rules. I am so sick of this. I keep wanting to go to a psychologist but I am scared and ashamed. And so tired! My most recent bloodwork suggests I am postmenopausal and I haven't had a normal period in years thanks to my self-abuse and eating disorder roulette, even at a ""normal"" weight. I gain and lose the a certain amount of weight every month, which is hard on me. I feel like I am destroying myself. Food is all I think about. I literally cannot think about anything else for more than 5 minutes. I am on my last legs here.

247,Elizabeth.patte...,05/22/2019,Bingeing/Purging/Starving cycle- thought i “outgrew” this,"I barely know how to begin. I can’t believe I’m here again. I’m 26 years old and i first realized i had an eating disorder when i was about 14. I was obsessed with engaging in certain behaviors and then eventually this led me to have a huge obsession with food. I felt guilty for eating a single meal, which led me to engage in certain behaviors. Eventually i did start engaging in different behaviors because i knew it would help me feel better. I always knew this behavior was straight up crazy because nobody else around me ever felt out of control around food. I never told anybody. I’ve never been over weight because of it technically but I’ve gained plenty of weight over the years and then i would diet hard or even just eat healthy and go back to what felt like a better weight. Anyway, although i have such a history with a certain eating disorder behavior i mostly stopped this cycle a few years ago. I learned how to eat more “carefully” i thought, and i would  often think that this was finally gone. Until one night where my obsessions would creep back in and i would eat anything i could get my hands on that might satisfy my cravings. Within the last year i got better at being on such a good schedule with food and i completed a workout program successfully and my body has been looking pretty great, except for the fact that most nights I engage certain eating disorder behaviors. I keep trying to forgive myself and let it go so i can start fresh but each day i come up with a new crazy way to sabotage myself again. Maybe never fully dealing with this unhealthy fixation on food has just crept back in on me. I have been dealing with a lot and working a ton. It’s just feels like i keep giving up on myself and i truly can’t believe I’m back engaging in these behaviors that i honestly thought i beat. If anyone reads this and can relate or has advice i would appreciate it so much.

I was able to get a handle on it around the time I was 24/25, but it crept in again about 7 years ago and it’s been with me ever since. I’ve tried several times to free myself of this burden I carry every second of every day, but it’s too strong. I overexercise and I want to stop so badly. I’m aware of what I’m doing, but I can’t stop. I have very minimal food during the day, and then I save everything for nighttime. I used to deal with certain eating disorder symptoms, but I went to a nutritionist for eating disorders and now I maintain a certain calorie intake. I eat the same thing every single day because this way I know how many calories I’m eating. Then on Friday and Saturdays I eat whatever I want. I eat more of certain foods and I love every minute of it...until it’s over. Then I feel so guilty and go right back to my restricted ritual on Sunday.  I weigh myself a couple times a day. I want it all to stop. I want to be normal. I want to exercise a normal amount and I want to eat what I want when I want. I hide so many things and I’m tired of it.

251,foodconfused,05/23/2019,personal story/personal group chat ,"I'm Ally. (23)
I've always had issues with my body. My mother was a model, and out of my 5 siblings, I seem to be the only one who isn't underweight naturally. I've had a lot of issues dealing with this growing up and dealt with it by emotional eating. ""Luckily"" back when I was at school and always enrolled in sports. Once I quit sports, I started gaining weight pretty steadily, to the point where I almost reached (a number I won't mention because I don't want to trigger anyone!) But, there was a drastic difference. Whenever there was a significant change in my body, my family would point it out. ""Maybe you should go to the gym."" ""Maybe you shouldn't eat that"" ""Maybe you could try losing X pounds so you don't go too far."" Or one of the worst comments: ""your food stinks! How could you eat that?"" from my younger sister who does have model measurements and has always had model measurements. If I asked her to borrow a top or even an oversized sweater she would remind me pretty harshly that we were NOT the same size. I would stretch the clothing or ruin it. This hurt me deeply, and I think this was the beginning of my body dysmorphia, mostly really bad thoughts about myself and sense of self-worth. I stopped shopping for clothing until necessary because I felt like I was a ""stretched"" out version of the model. I started to feel deeply unattractive and withdrew from the people around me. I still deal with these really dark thoughts. In college, I met my current best friend M, who was suffering from anorexia at the time. She noticed I had a very unhealthy relationship with food but I brushed it off. For some background, I had eating rules to minimize the embarrassment of people seeing me eat. I know this is irrational but I still do this.I reached a breaking point recently. In December of last year, I was at the highest weight I have ever been due to extreme binge eating, and the gym suggestions were coming at me on a daily basis from others. My anxiety keeps me from the gym so I took up another unhealthy habit after seeing a model/influencer try it. I started smoking. The weight dropped, I am ** pounds down. Before last week, it has been only praise from my friends since February and I have felt on cloud 9, but now my paranoia is fixed on my weight number, what foods to avoid for ""bloating"" and I no longer struggle to use behaviors. Nobody said anything negative about my body anymore. In fact, I had multiple people including my mom ask me for advice, all was good. Until last week, when I hung out at ""M""'s house (who has now recovered.. sort of) has expressed concern again. I tried brushing this off as jealousy until her friend told me she has been extensively talking about my recent weight loss and is very concerned, so I started to reflect on my behavior and also realized I had been saying things that are unhealthy. This week has been bad with family problems, and I was so upset that I pretty much used behaviors on Tuesday. Yesterday I did it again until my friend ""R"", saw me in an oversized t-shirt and jeans that now look pretty baggy. She was really concerned and forced me to eat, her boyfriend was also there so... not the best time lol. I understand she was trying to be supportive but it has made me feeling really embarrassed/ashamed and angry. I spent all night thinking about my body issues, goals, why and how I got here. I wanted to make/join a WhatsApp support group or group chat with people who are recovering if anyone would be interested, or maybe even just a texting buddy who's going through something similar. I'm tired of reaching out/talking to people I know and having them attempt to take control or charge of the situation from an authoritative viewpoint and I'm also tired of using behaviors and feeling so afraid of gaining weight. Would love to find more people on here interested in that extra boost of support too :) If you're not interested in a group chat and have read this entire ramble I've been staring at for over an hour now, then feel free to please give any words of advice or support, I would love to hear if anyone has these anxieties and also does this. I hope I made sense, I sort of rambled for a bit.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,05/23/2019-2:54pm","Dear foodconfused, welcome to","Dear foodconfused, welcome to the forums!

252,joyquill,05/23/2019,abusive family+ed recovery struggles,"I am a 17 y/o girl in high school. I've been struggling with bulimia and purging anorexia for almost a year now. It began as trying to be healthier and stop being overweight, but it disintegrated into starving and then binging and purging. My family has become involved and I'm enrolled in an outpatient recovery program at my medical provider. I'm being monitored by my parents and I have to sleep in their room at night to prevent any disordered eating. My parents are extremely upset at me for my disordered eating and they keep getting more upset as time goes on. They hold things over my head, like the time they set aside for taking me to appointments or the money they spend on food that I binge/purge. This is after years of shaming me for my eating habits and weight throughout my childhood. They refuse to take blame for my illness and insist that I have chosen to hurt myself on my own accord.I want to recover so badly and live a normal life, but it's so hard to even maintain a few days of normal eating and abstinence without giving in to my self hatred and reliance on food and body image. My daily routine practically revolves around food or using behaviors. My friends are concerned about me and my boyfriend wants me to recover and be healthy. I want to do it for them but I'm scared of gaining weight or losing my coping mechanism for my toxic family and depression.I know that what I'm doing is unhealthy and that I will never be happy with my weight as long as I have an eating disorder. Does anyone have any advice for overcoming my abusive family and healing myself? I'm truly lost right now and I'm losing my will to fight against the illness.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,05/23/2019-3:23pm","Dear joyquill, we would like","Dear joyquill, we would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove specific eating disorder behaviors, which are not allowed on the forums.

253,icanandiwill33,05/20/2019,my story + scared to ask for doctor's help?,"Please read all the way through, thank you so much.I've always thought I was fat.
I was an extremely skinny child (which I can now see, looking back at photos). But since I was 10 or 11, I've always looked in the mirror and seen myself as fat. My parents laughed when they found out I thought that, because I was so thin, it almost looked unhealthy. In reality, I ate a lot of food and loved it, I was just very athletic.I've always had a huge appetite. I remember eating lunch at school when I was 12, and seeing my friends with smaller appetites barely eat a thing. I wondered why I couldn't have the same self control they had. That same year, a boy commented that my butt looked big in skinny jeans. This stuck with me for YEARS until I realized that a big butt was something desirable in society. Nevertheless, to me, it only confirmed what I already thought in my head: I was fat.When I started going through puberty, I perceived my totally normal weight gain as a sign that I needed to go on a diet. It's so sick that my mind was already so skewed, to even think that gaining weight to accommodate for the fact that I was also growing a lot taller was abnormal. The diets never worked. I was extremely active and loved food, I couldn't eat less. I always ate more than other people. I think this is pretty normal for an active, growing teenager. But as I grew, this appetite never left me.In my first year of high school, I ate all the food my brother got at a party. My parents had it hidden somewhere. This was the first time I remember being shamed for eating something. Partly because it was my brother's, and partly because it was a lot. From then on, whenever I ate a lot of something, or food would go missing, my family would shame me. I understand. They thought it was disrespectful. They bought this food for everyone, and they bought it to use as ingredients in dinner, and I was just eating it all. But, 3 years later, and these voices of shame and guilt have become the ED voice in my head. At the end of grade 9, I had to be in a bathing suit for an event. I thought I was unfit. I desperately wanted abs. I tried to eat better, and exercise more, but I still couldn't control my eating. Keep in mind that at this time, I was still growing, and was still very thin. Grade 10 flipped my life upside down. I continued to gain weight (still was slim), as I was still growing taller. It started to fill out in places like my butt. At the beginning of that year, I started to get attention from guys because of my body. In grade 9, I had been shy, awkward, and unwanted. Now, I had a desirable feature, and I was made to think this was the only good thing I had going for me. I was harassed by boys I considered friends. It really messed me up. For a long time, I was simultaneously disgusted and flattered by their behavior. Even my friends didn't help. Sometimes I would go overboard on eating. I still had a big appetite, and only mild binging tendencies, but no ED behaviors yet. I was still happy as could be, a little insecure sometimes, but I didn't obsess about food and weight. I didn't have a clue what a calorie was and what they meant.I vividly remember something I said to a friend that year that really showcases how an ED was starting...""I feel like I could eat this food right now and I'd still be hungry."" It's so painful looking back at that. I wish I could hug the girl I was 2 years ago. She had such an insatiable hunger within her, likely caused by insecurities and loneliness. That's how I interpret this quote, anyways.Going into grade 11, I gained enough weight to start looking a little less like my usual self. This is the first time I remember eating weird combinations of food in large amounts when I was stressed, bored, and/or alone. I hardly noticed. It's sad, because I didn't really want to. I just thought...someone likes some part of me, so may as well go to them and feel less lonely, right?Over the course of that year, I got to my highest weight ever, and was looking unhealthy. I was still doing my sports, but they were more difficult. Sometime in that year, the shame after eating started. I realized how much weight I had gained and I was embarrassed that people had to look at me this way. Family members made comments. I tried to diet and lose weight, and that just caused more self hatred when I binged.The summer after grade 11 began, and I was doing a 4 week camp for my sport. I was still using eating disorder behaviors, but I still rapidly lost weight and muscle. I knew I had a problem at this point, but my happiness from the weight loss overshadowed my concerns.
I got compliments from family members. Some mothers of the girls I play sports with said ""you're so skinny now!"" They thought they were being nice, but this was toxic. Grade 12 (this year) started, and I was terrified of gaining weight, and of subsequently disappointing myself and others (including my family, and those moms who made the comments).This is when everything took a turn for the worst. Since September, I have felt suffocated and trapped. Every moment of my day is spent thinking about food and weight. What should I eat next? How can I eat the lowest calories possible? Have I gained weight? I can;t go a day without thinking about the weight of myself and others. I cried after I ate and my stomach felt extremely full, most times after a binge. My binges this year have been so bad, I have not even been able to walk afterwards. I just lie in my bed and cry. I despise myself so much. I constantly would take pictures of myself all year and compare them to pictures from the summer to see how much I gained. I have been so consumed by this, I can barely focus in school. I don't want to go to social events or hang out with my friends, I lie in my bed and cry before I go, if at all. I put a blanket over my mirror because I get depressed when I see myself. Now, it's a month away from prom and I'm trying to use eating disorder behaviors, but I still binged today. I haven't gained everything back, but in my mind, I may as well have.
I was in a really dark place in March, and tried disordered eating behaviors, but it hardly worked. So I'm just stuck with all this weight I've gained.
My family refuses to acknowledge this, probably because I'm at a healthy weight. They still call me a rat and a pig if food goes missing.I'm going to the doctor for a physical soon, and I think I may need help. I want to tell my dr everything I said here, but I'm afraid. She's a no nonsense type of doctor, and often dismisses health concerns. As well, I'm afraid I won't be taken seriously because:-I am at a healthy weight
-She will think I am just an unhealthy eater, and need to learn how to eat better because I don't know how
-My parents don't take it seriously, so why would my doctor (granted, I haven't told my parents absolutely everything I've written here, particularly the mental struggles)
-I'll be treated, and not be allowed to lose weight in the process. I hate the weight I'm at right now, it's not comfortable at all.Any help is greatly appreciated :)",_admin_moderator,"Tue,05/21/2019-9:35am","Dear icanandiwill33, we would","Dear icanandiwill33, we would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove detailed descpriptions of sexual harassment and mentions of specific food, which is not allowed on the forums.

255,equillibrium,05/21/2019,Do I even need recovery or just counseling?,"I have been struggling with this problem for the past month and it’s been affecting my mental health a lot. For a large part of my life I had been overweight and dealt with body image issues beginning middle school, but I lost a lot of weight going into high school and I became really thin. I maintained that weight for the first 2 school years until I met the love of my life during my 11th grade year, and that’s when all the weight gain began, due to the endless amount of weekend dinner dates and indulgences. But as they say, the honeymoon phase goes away and along with that, went my distraction from my body. I had a physical check up at that time and my doctor informed me my BMI was higher than what was healthy and I didn’t worry much.. After all I was taking boxing classes a few times a week. My boyfriend has his senior prom this year and since he’s taking me, I wanted to look “perfect” and decided that I needed to lose a lot of weight.. That’s what kickstarted everything. At first I attempted a “healthy” route at losing weight by just eating more nutritional whole foods but that quickly turned into heavy restriction and having safe foods I would eat every day. safe food every day along with intense workouts really depleted me. I was terrified of eating out and had to count every single calorie going into my body, which wasn’t much... This turned into a binge/purge/restrict cycle and I was miserable.. lost my period, my happiness, my sex drive, hunger cues, etc. This went on for about 3 months until I decided I was going to get better and not be scared of food so I began upping my calorie intake little by little while still losing a lot of weight. Still obsessively counting calories, exercising but I was eating a lot more than before. I eventually got to the point where I was eating more. My doctor gave me supplements and my metabolism slowly got better and I got my period back (i’ve had it twice since then). My question and genuine concern is.. I didn’t recover on the minimum calorie guidelines but I feel nutritionally restored at this point BUT my hair continues to fall out and my nails are super thin still, and of course I restrict still but not as much. I stopped counting calories a couple weeks ago, began eating whenever I felt I needed to and I have gained some noticeable weight back on these lower calories.. My mental state is at my worst currently, I’m terrified of gaining all that weight back and I have had disgusting thoughts about myself. Do I need recovery, or just counseling? I don’t want to eat more than I need to and end up overweight again..",_admin_moderator,"Tue,05/21/2019-3:06pm","Dear equillibrium, we would","Dear equillibrium, we would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove numbers for calories as well as specific details about food intake, which are not allowed on the forums.

256,sportygirl,05/15/2019,From Lovato_ - Concerned about my habits/behavior,"Hello, I am not sure if this is place for my concerns but after reading some of the other comments I figured it was worth some discussion. I am also not sure if I am developing an eating disorder, and although I understand no one here is a doctor I figured I would reach out for some opinions before talking with my own doctor about these issues I've been dealing with. Some background info about myself is that I have been diagnosed with GAD, BP II, PTSD, and have not yet had BPD ruled out. I am 24 years old, and have been overweight for almost all of my life with brief periods of consistent and healthy exercise, and have been consuming a vegan diet.. About two months ago, after a long period of no activity, I was at my heaviest. After a yearly check up with my primary physician, my blood work showed that my cholesterol was higher than ever, and my liver enzymes were being affected in an unhealthy way. This to me was my final wake up call to make a change in my life, and ever since I have been on a spiral of obsession. In an effort to lose weight fast I began to work out vigorously every day. Weight began to slowly come off, but no matter how much I lost in one week it never felt like enough. I've started consuming a certain amount of calories every day and this was working for me, but I'm worried about the long term affects it will have on my relationship with food and my overall health. It has taken a toll on my relationship at home and with friends because I am constantly worried about ingredients in meals being prepared for me that I have just found myself eating separately from everyone else when I can. I always make sure that I am getting enough essential nutrients, but it seems that more often than not I am finding myself eating less and less to lose the weight. I have started pre planning meals days in advance and if I know that one day will be more dense than another, I find myself restricting. I know that this behavior is dangerous but I can't find myself stopping. Every time the number on the scale goes down, my mind sees it as progress and I become extremely fixated to keep going. With stress from graduate school and the addition of food obsession and worry, my anxiety has been the worst it's ever been, so much that I have started to concern myself with other health issues in my body that I worry my eating habits may have affected such as my heart and brain.

257,tiff0089,05/13/2019,Thank you and More Questions :) ,"Hello everyone, First I want to say how truly grateful I am to these forums. I really appreciate how everyone here is so supportive and offers such excellent advice and insights. This is so valuable for people like me who are in the very early stages of understanding the ED and how it has had power over me for much longer than I have realized. I am trying very hard to go against the ED voice, but I am finding that I cannot deny it for more than a day or two at a time. After I eat, I feel extremely guilty and go back to restricting and counting calories. Eating makes me feel like I have lost control and like I have failed at something. And as much as I hate to admit it, eating does make me fear that I will not only gain weight, but become fat. I now understand that these things are part of the ED and that many others who fight EDs have these very same thoughts, fears, and behaviors. These feelings are what make it so hard for me to sustain regular eating. I am wondering how one even begins to go against these fears and feelings? How can I begin to see eating as something healthy and purposeful and not some shameful practice that I need to abstain from?  Thank you again for everything so far.

259,moranam,05-12-19,how to ask for help,"I am 17 years old and recently food has become an obsession. When I'm not eating I want to be and when I am eating I hate myself. I've been restricting calorie intake so much that I've dropped weight in the past two months. It would be more to be honest but every few days I will stop restricting  because I'm so hungry and craving everything and I binge eat. I don't know what to do anymore, and I think part of the problem is that since I've lost weight I've gotten so much positive reinforcement from my friends and family. My mom makes comments about it and is so happy because she's always tried to get me to drop weight. But now I'm stuck in this cycle and weighing myself constantly and even my boss had to talk to me to tell me that I have been spacing at work and not being a very good employee and she doesn't know why. I have headaches and am dizzy and irritable. But I don't know how to say anything when my mom is so proud of me and the number on the scale is dropping because when that number drops I feel accomplished. But as soon as that number goes up I'm back to misery. I'm just not happy and I'm not sure what to do. If anyone has any advice I would appreciate it.

260,jakthebomb,05/13/2019,I am conflicted / trying to get better,"I don't know how to start this post or know what questions to ask.  I was recently diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting Type.  Part of me is in shock, another part is in denial.  I am also conflicted about getting help and recovering from this.  I feel that I have a logical side of me that is saying you need to eat more and take better care of yourself.  Then there is another side of me that is instilling guilt after I eat anything.  It is a constant battle, every single day.  I have friends that really don't understand what is going on.  They yell at me to ""Just Eat"" as if it is something I can do on a whim.My psychiatrist told me I must eat a minimum of calories a day (I am omitting numbers since I know it is not allowed). When she said the number, my immediate reaction was panic and defensive.  I told her F* NO.  After the appointment, I was mad at myself for reactivating the way I did.A month went by and I had my follow-up appointment.  She took my weight to see how much change occurred.  I asked her to not tell me as I have been avoiding scales like the plague.  I didn’t realize the information would be included in my after visit summary.  It showed quite a bit of loss vs a month prior.  I was filled with joy that it went down.  It is like a deep part of me is happy that I am losing weight, it also doesn’t seem to care how I achieve this.  I feel that I’d rather be dead than fat and ugly.I am proud of myself when I go so long without eating anything.  It is like a challenge I give myself, to see how long I can hold out.  When I do eat, I feel like a failure.  I say to myself over and over, you are being bad Catherine.I often watch stories about others who have struggled with this.  I look at their lowest weight as a goal to achieve rather than something to avoid.  Seeing them recover by being forced to eat or a NG tube gives me panic.Part of why I am posting this, it has gotten to a point where my work is being affected.  I am forgetting things; I feel weak and almost lose focus when driving to and from work.  But I also feel like I can’t do anything to help myself.  I work 5 days a week and don’t have time nor the money to go to a in-patent care or hospital.I am sorry that this all seems out of whack and just a bunch of random thoughts.  I have been trying to understand how I got to this point and push myself to get better.Thanks,

261,gg_77,05-02-19,Don't know where to start....,"Hi everyone! I am new here, and am not quite sure where to start. I have a history of eating disorders in my family. Both my parents had/have eating disorders, my extended family have eating disorders, and so on. I have always grown up around people who either eat way too much to stuff emotions or question every food decision you make, saying ""are you sure you want to eat that?"" I struggled with weight in high school. This was not due to any particular problem, just that my curves grew before I did: I grew out then up. Last summer, I went into therapy for severe OCD. This OCD didn't bleed over into my eating habits, though. I guess I have always been afraid of that. But here I am now, almost a year later. My OCD is manageable, but my eating habits are out of control. I am into weightlifting and love working out. I have a healthy relationship with the gym. One of my family members had exercise bulimia, so I make sure to not get to that point. But my eating is out of control. My cravings are absolutely wild and I give into them, I cannot resist them. When I have nothing to do, I eat. Not to fill any holes in my life, not to stuff emotions, I just can't stop thinking about food. I eat when I am not hungry, I obsess over some type of food, and I cannot stop. I want to stop. But, I don't know how. Where do I start? How do I stop these twisted cravings and thoughts and feelings of guilt after eating anything. I feel like a different person when I reach for food, I feel like I am lusting after it instead of using it to feed and fuel my body and my brain. Please help.

My family doctor is unable to refer me for mental health care, I suspect because I live in a rural area and we just do not have those kinds of resources out here. I have called numerous counselors, therapists, ect., both within my area and up to two hours driving distance and have been told either they don't accept my insurance, are not accepting new patients, or they do not treat adults. I have also left several messages with no call backs. Many times no one even picks up the phone to begin with. I have also tried to utilize NEDAs services to get help with finding help, but out of the three contacts they gave, one is not accepting new patients, and the other two simply haven't responded.  I realized in the fall that I needed help and have been trying off and on since then to get it. Without going into too much detail, I am getting to the point where my physical health is being affected by this. I have tried to increase my intake on my own, but I just cannot seem to maintain healthy eating for more than a couple days at a time. I always start restricting and counting calories again. I am locked in this frustrating cycle and I really want to escape it. I have about a year left of graduate school and have ambitious goals for both my life and my career and I know I will not be able to achieve them if this problem with my eating continues. Does anyone know of some other things I can do to help myself until I can find professional help?

266,JenFos,04/27/2019,Trying to recover..,"My name Is Jenny, I have struggled with an eating disorder since I was 15, I am 23 now.
About a year and a half ago I came to the realization that I truly did have an eating disorder- I had denied it for so so very long. One day, as I was walking across my college campus I found myself winded, nauseas, and wanting to use behaviors because my body was in such bad shape. I had no energy, yet I thought I looked amazing. I just wanted to be as beautiful as the girls around me, the models in the media.. One day while at school I had eaten lunch, but I just could not stand the feeling of being full- being full must mean my stomach was protruding and I was getting fat. I quietly made my way to the most discreet bathroom on campus and used behaviors. Then, I passed out on the toilet and remained there for at least 5 minutes. When I came to I picked myself up and carried on as if nothing had happened. Looking back, I looked so very sickly, but I thought I looked beautiful. I am a Christian and I remember sitting on the bathroom floor of my college and thinking... ""Oh my gosh... I am killing myself"". My mother-in-law worked on the campus and everything in me was pushing me to just tell her, but I was terrified. One day, I was studying in the library and I could hardly keep my head up, I could not focus, and I felt like I was withering away, so I made the choice in my head that the next time I saw my mother-in-law I would tell her and ask for help- something I had NEVER done, never told anyone. As I was walking out of the library to head to my next class, there she was. I am not sure how I obtained the strength.. but I walked up to her and told her to sit down and I needed to tell her something. I told her I needed help. She looked at me very confused and the next words out of my mouth were, ""I need help, mom. I think I have an eating disorder"". Tears filled her eyes and she said, ""Oh my.. just, not eating? or purging?"", it took all of the strength I had to muster the words.. ""both"" as I held my head down in shame. She said, ""Oh dear."" and immediately embraced me, in the middle of the coffee shop that led into the library. Right after I finally made the decision to tell her, somehow she was right there and I knew if I did not tell her then, I never would. She kindly walked me to the campus counseling center and sat with me as I filled out my intake. My amazing school counselor cleared her entire schedule and invited me into her office as I held my head low balling in embarrassment, shame, and fear. And thus began the start of my road to recovery. I could tell you I have been successful in my journey the entire time, but that would be a lie. I knew my cycle, I had been in it for over 7 years. For a while I was doing amazing, I had stopped purging and slowly introducing small portions of food into my tiny and shrunken stomach. I was doing so so very well. But that did not last long. I lied to my counselor and told her I was doing fine and eating without purging... but I was still purging here and there. I go through a cycle, I go for weeks, sometimes months of eating and not purging, but then I would feel like I was over eating and becoming huge- my body dysmorphia would take over. I wish I knew what I really looked like rather than what the mirror showed me. Lately, I had been doing so well, eating and feeling so great about myself. But I relapsed. I have been purging lately and I am so ashamed. The journey to recovery is such a hard one, and I wish I could fix it all at once, but I know it is a gradual process. Why can’t I see what I really look like? I want to overcome this. I have such a strong will to beat this… but it looms over me every moment of every day. I feel lost, hopeless, and I am afraid that I am slowly killing myself.

267,nikittyy,04/24/2019,Scared that I'm developing binge eating disorder? ,"Hey guys, this might be a long post.I was diagnosed and went into IOP treatment for anorexia when I was sixteen and a sophomore in high school, and continued going to therapy and doctors appointments at that same treatment center for about a year after that. Once I was about a senior, my mom decided I could stop going to therapy because she felt like I had improved. She was still prepping my meals and whatnot, and monitored my weight and what I was eating pretty closely. My mental state was pretty terrible, I felt extremely uncomfortable with the weight gain.I gradually think I lost a few pounds naturally here and there as I entered my freshman year of college, as my mom and I had started going on walks again, (we used to do this during the eating disorder but stopped once I entered treatment) and I wasn't eating as strictly as I had been. I was on the lower end of a healthy weight for my height, and the weight loss wasn't really intentional. I got my first boyfriend my freshman year of college, and he ended up cheating on me in the summer. I kind of spiraled, and lost a bit more weight. I am now a sophomore in college and I at some points this year I have been at or near the same weight I was when I went into treatment the first time. However, I went through January deciding I wanted to just gain a few pounds and not have such a rigid schedule with food- I was tired of food controlling my life, so I decided to try and eat a bit more. I'm not sure if extreme hunger is a real phenomenon, but that entire month was sort of spent overeating (possibly binging?) and my mom took notice and confronted me. She thought I needed to see a therapist.I don't necessarily feel out of control when I'm eating, but I feel like I need to make the most of the times I slip up because I'm not going to let myself eat that food again very often. Most of the time I also feel hungry. I know the solution to this would just be to work on intuitive eating and fixing my relationship with food, but I have a routine of foods I like to eat.So I've been seeing my therapist, and I went back to watching my food intake for the last three months because I want to get back to a lower weight and I feel embarrassed about my mom catching me eating so much. I haven't brought up the eating disorder issues with the therapist even though I know I should, because I'm afraid of change. Right now I feel like I can go back to the anorexia whenever I want and I don't want that control taken away.The past week I feel like I've started to overeat again, and I don't know why. I'm afraid I'm developing binge eating disorder. Could that be it, or is my body just craving the things I have been restricting from it for three years? Ever since I stopped going to the treatment center I have eaten pretty clean, I still avoid a lot of foods. I tend to eat the same things every day and I never let myself have treats.I don't know what to do. I feel like food controls my entire life, and it's all I think about every day. I just turned twenty one, and I feel like I'm still caught up with issues other girls my age have gotten over because I'm still obsessed with being skinny, and I only like myself when I'm a certain weight.I know the logical answer would be to open up to my therapist and get help, but I just want to keep the illusion of the control of choices I have. I know anorexia is controlling me though.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,04/25/2019-1:20pm","Dear nikittyy, welcome to the","Dear nikittyy, welcome to the forums!

268,bnyanez,04-08-19,Just Starting,"Hi, I'm a college student and I just joined probably about 5 minutes ago. Ever since I've been young, I have struggled with my weight and eating habits. I'm not entirely sure if I have an eating disorder, but I know that my weight and diet affect me mentally and I get very depressed about it. I am a figure skater, and I feel like much of my experience has derived from being in this sport. I feel like I have developed a mindset where my weight and looks define who I am and what I do. I have gained weight while being in college, because I don't have my mom or someone around to criticize what I eat. However, I do have the tendency to be conscious about how much I eat when I am around people, so when I am in my dorm, I binge on a lot of snacks when my roommates leave. I've had a tendency to binge any time my family, boyfriend, friends, or people aren't around since I was in middle school. It feels like a pattern that I can't get myself out of. Every week I have some epiphany that some new diet or attempt to work out is going to change the way I feel, but it never follows through. I'm running out of options, and when I have tried to talk to my friends/family, they think I'm being over dramatic and that I don't know how to control myself. I just wish they understood the severity of how it makes me feel. I'm alone a lot in college, so it makes me even sadder to deal with this. I just want to be happy and healthy. I'm afraid if I continue like this, I'll run into serious health problems or continue until I'm obese. I'm so ashamed of my body, that I don't like going to the gym or wearing certain clothes because I don't want people to look at me in a negative way.

I've been in a cycle of doing well, eating according to my meal plan for 1-2 weeks and then relapsing and having to master up the courage and strength to start recovery all over again.
It occurs to me frequently how nice and somewhat comforting it would be to buddy up with someone who's facing similar struggles to mine. We could communicate to encourage and support each other during the good and bad times of recovery.
Let me know if you'd like to chat, I would love to hear from you.
Take care,

272,anna118,04-10-19,Tips for Not Binging,"Hi - I would like some tips from fellow ED people.  As a background: I have a long history of anxiety and recovered from depression, and along with that in the past two years I picked up habits of binging and purging, which got especially exacerbated last year along with my anxiety and depression to the point where I feared for Thanksgiving and begged my parents not to make me go with them to our family gathering because I didn't want to eat because I knew I would want to purge. At this point, which was just last Thanksgiving, I had a sort of ""come to Jesus"" moment when I realized I would be graduating college in a few months and I really wanted to terminate the binge/purge cycle. That December I did really well when I got home after finals because I was in the comfort of my own home and my mom helped me with keeping healthier snacks in the house and cooking a lot of my meals, along with myself being able to put my full focus into noticing when I was or wasn't hungry. I try to avoid the scale, but I definitely noticed and felt a lot better about myself with how I looked and felt with just 5 weeks of winter break as soon as I dropped the purges and watched what I ate.  As soon as I got back to school, I got out of track with not eating as healthy and eating a lot on the weekends, and even though I would get uncomfortable with all that I was eating, I never got too out of control or purged and I was able to remind myself that I was doing way better than before break. After Spring Break however, I took steps backwards with my urges to eat - I've been binging daily, eating often very mindlessly and excessively. Basically whatever I could get my hands on at every point of the day. I've gotten to the point currently where I eat just because I see something in my vision. I will feel extremely full and feel like my stomach is about to explode, but my mouth is craving more. I've been stressed out with graduating soon, but I'm getting the most of my anxiety from how out of control so quickly my eating habits have changed and how bloated my body has gotten within just a month and a half. I see a therapist weekly and we talk about how I eat as coping for my anxiety and she gives me suggestions on mindfulness and how to approach situations without turning to food first, but in the meantime I wanted to know if anyone that is currently experiencing any recovery from binging and purging habits on what you do. I'm extremely proud of myself that I have not purged since I was home for winter break, but I am worried that if I keep up this binging/mindless eating habit that I am going to end up purging again. What do you guys do to help you from not mindless eat, see food and just eat it- eating has literally consumed my thinking for the past two years, I genuinely haven't been able to enjoy a normal day where I go a solid period of time without thinking what I am going to eat next, especially in a setting like college and away from home.   I would like to say that I am not trying to purposely lose weight (even though that would be nice), but rather I understand that once I have a grip on my eating, then the weight will come along with it. I just would like to hear from fellow recoverers rather than my therapist and my parents on how to cope and not be tempted to grab food impulsively when I'm tired or bored, or also how you guys handle stress and anxiety in general. (Sorry if some of this sounds repetitive - I don't talk about my history and current anxieties of binging/purging with any of my friends... not really something I ever talk about out loud about except my therapist and family, which isn't too often for how often it bothers me)",_admin_moderator,"Thu,04/11/2019-12:40pm",Hi anna118 and welcome to the,"Hi anna118 and welcome to the forums!

273,Butterflygirl,04-07-19,AN Relapse... and food dreams,"So last month was my “ana”versary as I like to call it. This time last year I was being NG fed and I was very unwell. I had FBT and I was weight restored re fed ect and started to feed myself without restriction. However In December I started exercising and losing weight. Since then I started school again and stopped eating much at all. I’ve lost weight since then and I’m feeling the mental effects because my AN is very happy and feeling VERY restrictive. Because I’ve been through this before, I’m more aware of what is going on, I’m not in as much denial because he’ll, I know where I’ll end up if I continue. My daily habits normally are unhealthy. All term I told myself that I’d maintain my weight a bit under my healthy weight, but classic ED saw the number drop and boom she was hooked. I’d also walk around having conversations with her, she’d say “it’s ok, when it’s Easter holidays you can stop, just restrict until then, then you can eat.” So I believed her, and I ate normally and without extreme guilt for one day, and then 2 days later and I am restricting, exercising and feeling constant anxiety. I knew my mum makes breakfast on Sunday’s, so all Saturday I had to restrict. What I’m trying desperately to say is I want to get better this time, I truly do! I’ve forgotten what it’s like to be healthy and recovered, it’s been too long. I want to be able to eat without guilt so badly, but I feel like I’ll never be able to overcome my rules and regulations around food. I have things I must do based on weather, activities, time of day, day of week, mental state ect. I can’t imagine ED would EVER let me eat on a day or time where I can get away with restricting because no one is watching.
So I need help. How do I let myself eat for the holidays? Like I can eat, but the guilt is immense. And the fear and anxiety leading up to it is so crippling that I don’t even taste the food let alone enjoy it. I’m scared guys, and I FRICKING WANT TO BE ABLE TO EAT why is that so bad? ED just had a huge go at me for saying that, but at least I can say it right? That’s gotta be better than last year. I just wish I had someone who understands and can help get me through this, someone who can tell me that I won’t die if I eat certain foods.
Thanks guys, hope you’re all doing ok and just know that we can get through this together, food ain’t the enemy.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,04/09/2019-6:36pm","Hi Butterflygirl, and welcome","Hi Butterflygirl, and welcome to the forums!  We're so glad you found us, and hope that you will find the support you're looking for here on the forums. Just so you're aware, your post has been edited slightly to remove the mention of weight-related numbers, behaviors, specific foods, and comments that might be triggering to other users here on the forum.

274,Eddieking,04-04-19,Abortive Start,"Hi Everyone! After continual comments of concern from friends and family about my weight I know I need to make a change.Weighing a certain amount and being a certain height, I know I DEFINITELY need to gain weight. With help from my family I’ve planned to start ‘bulking’ however I just can’t force myself to do it to any big extent. As soon as I eat a certain amount of calories in a day (an achievement anyway) I think okay, I’m not hungry now, ive eaten a normal persons calories so I’m fine right?I know full well that those calories have still been meticulously planned and bare all my same restriction patterns. However when I actually eat it feels easy to do so as I do it, I just can’t push forward and to eat a certain amount of calories I know I’ll need to do gain weight.Basically, I know I need to gain weight objectively, however in my mind I don’t see that I really need to? As soon as I eat and stop feeling cold for a bit I think... nah i’m actually fine, I’ve eaten a certain amount of calories and more today, what more do you want from me? I’m just tall so probably why I look skinny.I just can’t get my head in the mentality to eat when I’m not hungry or to let myself tackle fear foods just happy to eat lots of calories of what I choose. I realise this post is basically just me ranting to myself, I just can’t accept that I will really need to bulk up? But at the same time know that I DEFINITELY NEED to change my mindset. I think that if I eat a meal and aren’t hungry afterwards... my body can’t be that bad otherwise I’d want more?I guess all I can say is thanks for listening haha - god help me",_admin_moderator,"Sun,04/07/2019-3:37pm",Post Edited,"Hi Eddieking,  We are glad to hear that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

275,lupiebutterfly,04-06-19,Having Surgery - No Exercise for a certain amount of time...HELP!,"I am scheduled to have surgery at the end of April and have been told that I won't be able to exercise for at a certain amount of time. I suffered from Anorexia then Bulimia for much of my young adulthood and thought I had recovered but, over the past 5 years, ED has reared his ugly head. I am very restrictive in what I eat (or rather, don't eat) and cope with things by exercising. The fact that I feel so compelled to exercise is what scares me. I'm facing surgery at this point because I did so much damage to my body by over-exercising and not giving my body any rest. I am choosing this time after surgery to focus on real recovery. I will do the work all over again and reach out for professional help if needed. What I am hoping to find on this forum is support during what I know will likely be the most difficult thing I have done so far. I am trying to see it as an opportunity for my body to heal and also for my mind. I'm absolutely petrified. What will I do when I can't even do a certain exercise for a certain amount of time? I never just sit and do nothing. If anyone has ever been though something like this, please tell me how you got through it and anything that you found helpful. Thank you so much for reading my post.

276,sportygirl,03/28/2019,Anger ,"Hi everybody, I feel like I keep being angry but because I can't deal with the anger except by pushing it away (and eat). In my life I never felt ok to be angry or to express anger. I was always afraid I would hurt anyone by it or that something bad would happen to me if I did. Now a days if I'm angry I just push it aside and pretend everything is ok.  but basically I say to myself I'm not important. yes this is the message I got in the past, but it doen't have to be like that anymore right? But how to get rid of anger? If I don't agree with something or if something is bothering me, I say this in the nicest way. (after some debate with myself on how or if to say it). I take the anger out of the picture. Afraid to do something wrong or for example losing my job or something. Like I'm afraid to get angry.Is there a safe way to practice with this? I tried boxing in the past, but I don't feel like I can get to the angry part of me. So basically I'm just doing the punches and kicks without any feelings. This is like not productive for the anger I have. Still because I put away all the feelings and makes me eat because how much can a person take? (And still feel I have to be able to take everything) Also I keep reading about 12 steps, could that be something to start with? If yes, do you have a little information about this since I don't live in the US.

277,chunkymonkey68,02/17/2019,Severe Toe Pain and Really Hating It Controlling my Exercise Routine,"Plus I am around the apartment more until this heals and feeling more tempted to open the fridge and eat food out of boredom and NOT just because I feel hungry. I had been doing so well. I was walking 4x per week after work, my weight was down and felt Totally in Control in spite of having binged a few times as well. I was binging out of feeling tired from working my 2 jobs, and the exercise was the way I forgive my self for this bad habit...Now i feel powerless and cant go for de-stressing walks until the pain in my toe subsides. I also cut into my finger as I was planning to eat my Little Cutey orange the other morning.They are supposed to be easy to just unpeel the skin of their oranges, it is like an orange well know for this primary benefit in eating them.I have low blood sugar in the morning and take meds at night so in the morning i appreciate Lil Cutey Oranges as they are Usually easy to peel and eat.Well, I had to use a steak knife to cut the orange. I somehow disassociated for a few seconds and next thing I know I was stopping myself from cutting into my index finger which was supposed to be holding the orange from slipping as i cut it.So I was bleeding and now am recovering from a cut usually not ever possible when eating lil Cutey oranges. I think someone in the factory thought they would be wise jerks and put the wrong oranges into the lil Cutey bags as the bag said it was them but these all have skin which requires a knife to open and eat.So there now I feel more intimidated in eating healthy food in the morning.

Just joking, 11 1/2 years. Doing Comedy helps me cope and keep my disease secret) my secretary job, my mom, my two dogs Cupcake and Brownie and Comedy, in that order. At home, my dogs need me (because I feed them), but my husband acts like he doesn't need me (I feed him too, but I guess kibbles and bites makes you more appreciative), and how can I blame him. Oh and I'm only an administrative assistant at work, so you know how many suits see me here, NONE!) I've been purging since I was 11. I'm 33 now and half a woman. Normal BMI and weight for my height most of the time, but my body's been falling apart over the years. I've lost teeth, my hair won’t grow and has been falling out so I were wigs all the time, I've never came on my period (I'm afraid it’s because of purging at such a young age) from the lack of hormones my body produces, my body cannot produce eggs, see half a woman. I bruise and bones break so easy now. I reached out to a treatment center in Maryland, and have an assessment coming up on April 5th, 2019. Just told my husband and my mother I have an eating disorder, and that was the toughest thing I've ever done. Needed them to know because they don't deserve to lose me unsuspecting and not knowing what was happening me. My heart been acting funny, but I ain't laughing! The closer it gets to my treatment center assessment date, I've been purging more, like I'm secretly trying to sabotage myself from life.

279,s.boewer,03/15/2019,physical pain,"I am really suffering from what a doctor said is a stomach ulcer and I am concerned for my overall health, when I should be feeling great because I have 7 months free from restrictive ED behaviors. I have had several ""flare ups"" causing me extreme nausea, feeling excessively full after small amounts of food, throwing up acid, stomach pains, dizziness, and this morning I passed out twice trying to get to the bathroom, scaring my mom who thought I was having a seizure. I only remember standing up the first time I passed out and then sitting on the toilet, I have no recollection of the second time I passed out at all. I do suffer from low blood pressure, which has caused me to pass out from standing up too fast in the past, and could of gotten up out of bed to abruptly I suppose. But today I am again suffering a flare up, and now have pain on my left side like a side ache from exercising, every time I breath. My concern is this issue has caused too much of a weight loss, and this passing out was a result of my body being too weak. I don't own a scale so I don't know what I weigh, and I have been thinner in my disorder, but I can tell I am lower than I should be to be healthy. I ate a solid and healthy dinner in spite of the nausea and pain it creates, but that was all I managed to get down all day. I am very disappointed because I am truly in recovery finally, and yet I feel worse now than I ever felt in my disorder days. I have a follow up appointment next week to try and get to the bottom of this ulcer with tests, and finally get  the correct medication to manage it. I was at first triggered by the sudden weight loss with thoughts of trying to maintain this lower weight, but I have used the many tools I've learned to just acknowledge such thoughts, and let them pass with no acting out on them so far. Before this ulcer I was at the gym again finally, starting to feel strong and fit again. Now I can barely get through my shift at work, needing to sit down to catch my breath several times from standing too long. So that's my problem now and I wonder if anyone out there has ever dealt with an ulcer before, and got through it somehow better then I am so far? I at least passed my state exam and am officially re-certified as a Drug and Alcohol Counselor again. Sorry for such a long post to ask a simple question, but I needed someplace to express my disappointment and concern for my health.

280,questions,03/25/2019,I can't tell if I need help ,"I can't decided if I have an eating disorder or if I need to seek help. Here are the reasonings I might have a problem:
spend hours a day thinking of food and my body
worried if I eat an unhealthy meal
always will pick the healthiest choice
watching what others eat closely and judging them (I can't always help it)
making sure I only eat the healthiest food, and get very concerned when I can't be healthy
 ex: inner panic when my mom made certain foods one night
lose weight every time I am at school even though it isn't intentional (I'm in college)
     - in general I find that i am I a lot more concerned about food at school
     - I began this school year at a certain weight but now am even less
workout as much as possible
always cold
very dry skin (but I also live in Wisconsin and its winter)
constantly critiquing my body imageAt the same time, I don't know if I really have a problem because after I mentioned all of this for the first time to my mom, I stopped worrying a little. The thoughts above come in waves and in the long run I just want to make sure I am eating healthy food and working not, my goal has never been weight loss. its not every night that I need to have a justification to have dessert or another snack, but at least half of the time I do.

-------------------------
I have struggled with bulimia and bouts of restriction off and on for about 13 years. For about the last five months, I have been restricting, which is worrying my husband of 11 months. Over all, he's supportive, and I am grateful for that. I'm sure it isn't easy for him dealing with me constantly changing my mind about what I want to eat, how much effort I am willing to put into getting better, and whether I really have a problem.He is helping me schedule medical appointments, which is quite helpful. He also sometimes asks how I'm feeling about food. I usually don't say much, because I'm not sure my feelings would make sense to him, but lately I have been making an effort to be more honest. So couple of hours ago, I mentioned to DH that even though I know he wants me to eat more, I feel embarrassed eating in front of him. His reply: ""Objectively, it's more embarrassing to be eating as little as you are"".
I found this rather depressing, and haven't done much since then except sit in bed feeling alternately hurt by his lack of tact, guilty for worrying him to the point that he feels the need to talk to me like that, and ashamed of taking such a little comment so personally.Part of me realizes I am being a bit overdramatic and ridiculous and should just get on with my day, but another part-- maybe the ED?-- wants to use this as a reason/excuse to drive the restriction more undercover and hide my feelings more. I guess I feel kind of alone and confused and unsure of what to do.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,03/26/2019-7:28pm",karenc,"Hi karenc,  We appreciate you posting here on the forum, however your reply has been deleted, as it did not adhere to our community guidelines.

284,jbusani,02/17/2019,New Here! Feel like my journey to recovery has paused,"Hi All, I'm new here on the forum and wanted to post to get some perspective about my thoughts recently. I have suffered from a very difficult relationship with food since the age of about 13. Since that age, i've spent periods of my life dieting (going to slimming classes with my mum, signing up for online programs, trying fad diets), thinking that I needed to lose weight. I was never ""stick"" thin, but I always thought ""if I just lose a bit/if I just tone up/if I just had a bit of a flatter stomach...then i'd feel comfortable"". I've spent as long as I can remember thinking that I'm not good enough yet - instead of enjoying my life, i'd been sitting there, pre-occupied, tense from worrying about what I looked like, and dizzy from not taking deep breaths due to anxiety it was causing me. At the age of 22, while visiting the doctor about the anti-depressants i'd been on/off for since 16, my doctor referred me to an eating disorder support service. I thought I always had an issue with food, but I didn't think I had an ""eating disorder"", especially as I thought there's nothing wrong with me, I just ""can't lose weight and it's MY fault, no wonder i'm a bit out of control"". I never realised that my relationship with food and my body could actually be the source of my difficulty.Now in my mid-20s, I've found my time at the support service has been positive (1 yr talking therapy, 1yr occupational therapy, and now monthly support groups). I haven't stepped foot in a slimming group in over a year and i'm off my anti-depressants thanks to my doctor's support (I realised that my mind needed care and attention through therapy (rather than meds) to change its patterns). Getting help from professionals has the been the best choice i've made. However - (of course there was going to be a ""but"", because no process ever runs smooth), i've run into a lot of anxiety recently wondering about the direction of my progress. Despite now refusing to diet ever again (I will not go back there), it's hard thinking positively about what i'm achieving and i'm terrified i'll again be driven to restrict my eating in some way. My actual weight seems to be the No. 1 pain-point. I've always been in the healthy range up until I started therapy, where I began to stop dieting, and now I am at a higher weight. While i've been thankful for less mental pressure, and more ""free"" feelings towards food (less of the good/bad labels I used to use), my mind is still pre-occupied with my weight and ""feeling fat"". Now my weight is technically over the recommend amount, I feel scared and confused of how recovering from an eating disorder and reaching a healthy weight can go hand in hand. While i've maintained my weight for 1yr now, I'm terrified that i'm not reading my scales right (I weigh once a week as was recommended to me, to show myself that I can maintain my weight WITHOUT dieting), and i'm even more irrationally scared that my therapist was maybe reading different results out to me this past year, so that i'd think I was maintaining my weight.

285,Notsickenough22,03/19/2019,Shame ,"Hey, guys, so I restricted today and was feeling extremely dizzy and like I couldn't really catch my breath so the feeling of my body sounding its natural alarm systems made me feel just a hatred for my body and it not allowing me to fully restrict in the way that I wanted too. A friend of mine that I shared my struggles with ED really pushed me to get out of my comfort zone and do something I didn't really want to do and I just got done eating a lot of food plus Desert food and now I feel really uncomfortable and I really want to purge because I just feel anxious about gaining so much weight in such a short amount of time. But I'm trying to become more comfortable with feeling uncomfortable that my body is satisfied. It's also a little frustrating because I don't know what ""satisfaction"" means without engaging in ED behaviors. I'm just completely over ""EDDY"" (Nickname for ED behaviors).I honestly think that diet culture is so harmful when in the process of trying to recover from an ED. For example, ever since I was a child my mom was always chasing a new diet or a new juice cleanse and I honestly believe that through that and through seeing those behaviors even to my adulthood today really shaped the way, in my young mind, my relationship to food and to my own body. there's always been a disconnection there. Even when I went home for a break from school, All my mother would talk about is her new diet and how good she felt, how fat I looked and how I needed to stop eating to lose some weight, so recovery is doubly hard because it's like a mixed messaging thing. it's just so frustrating.I'm sorry if this message is really long, I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense or mentions specific foods I ate. I'm in a really vulnerable state right now. I don't really know what I'm trying to say nor are my intentions are to trigger anyone into a spiral.

289,Zoomsm,03-11-19,How do I overcome it?,I have bulimia. It started out as anorexia but after binging with my friend it has turned into bulimia. I had anorexia for about 6 months then after my binge I’ve been binging and restricting and such ever since. I’ve been bulimic for 5 months and I’m so over it. My situation is a bit weird. My natural BMI growing up was always super low and I always got made fun of for it. So I started to eat way way too much to try to gain weight. Then I started losing it again and here I am. I’ve gained again from binging. I want to overcome it and I always have the mindset and then I just lose it and binge. I haven’t made it a week without messing up either by not eating or overeating. I’ve been trying so hard since January now. I can’t even go to anyone in person because technically I’m still underweight. But if I wanted to gain weight I’d want to gain weight from eating healthy not overeating one day then undereating the next. How do I tell myself this is the final time? It’s becoming so hard for me because now that it’s been 5 months my body is starting to adjust to weighing more making it harder to lose weight as it’s no longer just sitting as food or water weight but actually sitting. I never keep it up it seems like it’s taking me forever to lose it. And I can’t even go a week without binging.

291,gnatul8r,03-10-19,Chapter 1. The Dealbreaker.,"Hello Everyone. As a way of introducing myself, let me start with what happened today.He did not want to continue the relationship. He could not invest himself fully, because my attitude towards my eating-disordered mind would trigger negative patterns of his own. He knew all the signs. Even I had forgotten my own ticks, that I hadn't noticed him noticing. These were possibly projected from a previous relationship, a crucial one. They had met at a clinic. It lasted two years, ending in her relapse.In his own words, he told me, ""I do not want to repeat that.' I tried to tell him that this was not that. That i was not dependant. That I could not be triggered, that I was managing. He said it was about his own cycles of paranoia and resentment, that he did not want this as part of his life. The Dealbreaker. I expressed that I feel like an idiot. That i haven't been given a chance to respond. That it was unfair to doom one relationship on the basis of another. That is was unfair to read my 'weirdsies' of using certain behaviors as warning signs, when to me, these are coping mechanisms that limit panic. He said what bothered him was my casual, offhand manner of talking about my relationship with food and disorder. I think he meant my tolerance and normalisation of it. I said, What am i supposed to do? Lay down and cry? It is how i convey something without conveying its full gravity. It's something I have to deal with daily, so i make fun of it, to an extent.He was serious and investigative. Precisely what I love, and precisely the quality that leads to the observation of the minutia of my destructive habits. I am realising that these coping mechanisms are not enough. I never stopped purging. There were phases, but that after ten years of practice, this became a normal part of my existence, a part that I have to hide, a part that -I know without knowing- is alienating. I wrote a letter to him. Saying that he has had a profound effect on my direction. I never considered active recovery before. What I am saying, is that i am embarking on a version of myself that would not have begun to manifest if all this hadn't been discussed.I loved that man. So this is it. This is the part where I start to honestly chronicle my weaknesses, to actively assess and change my mental disposition, my habits, my fossils, my denial. Such honesty is new to me. I need your help. The alternative is lethal to love.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,03/13/2019-11:38am","Hi gnatul8er, and welcome to","Hi gnatul8er, and welcome to the forums! We're glad you found us.

    Why I am here is because another trama to my system has happened. No MD/specialist can help and I have an autistic adult child who needs me.
     My recent disaster: due to my jaw surgeries; disection and reconstruction of half my mandible w my fibula, I have a deilitating nerve disorder and thus since the medical community say they can't help, I did/do my own research.
      I purchased liver supplements. Well, in taking the supplement, it didn't touch my nerve condition. But it helped me drink water. (Didn't do this most of my life. Growing up w the generation that mom felt juice was more substancial). So I lost a dramatic amount of weight again. ...but I ended up w other complications.
    Now I am back to obsessing over food intake. I count hours til breakfast. I wonder when I should eat lunch since I eat breakfast late. Then I put food out of my mind and I am starving by dinner that I just eat more than I should.
    There are a lot of sweets hanging around...I don't eat them but can't eat my seeds due to vitamin b overload. So, I just go hungery.

I’m new here. I’ve been in therapy and active recovery for about a year and a half, still find it really hard to cope with my body.

298,bensurvivor,02/28/2019,need help,"Hello,  I'm looking for support and information on recovering from an eating disorder.  I'm male, 39 and just got off a prescribed medication I was physically dependent on for over a decade.  That withdrawal process was incredibly difficult for me but now that I'm off, 6 months later, a perhaps underlying eating disorder is coming into focus.I have had difficulties with overeating since I was in my early 20s while being on medication.  I am currently a certain amount of weight and 6'1'' and not on any medication.  This time last year I weighed a certain amount of weight.  My weight has fluctuated widely over the past 18 years.  I am trying to determine if it's the medication I've taken or if I truly have an eating disorder.  It very well might be both but I believe I need help and support just the same either way.  Right now, on binge days I eat a certain amount of calories.  This can last over a certain amount of time typically and occur on an almost weekly basis.  I use exercise to help control my weight and often over engage in that activity in response to overeating.  I have had depression and anxiety but currently do not experience them to a limiting degree.I'm looking for online and community support where I can talk with others about some of the difficult emotions and thoughts I'm experiencing while learning about tools and resources and the ways others have addressed their eating disorders.  I'm familiar with the 12 step approach through AA but I haven't found it especially helpful.  I'm not sure if it would be any different for an eating disorder but I'm open to hearing more information about it.I'm sorry if I'm sharing too much information in an overly straightforward way but I think it's important to give the complete, most accurate picture.

300,BluKitten,02-08-19,My 3-4 year story,"My eating disorder story began in middle school. I was in 7th grade when I first stopped eating meals, which led to loss of weight. I was, and am still, too lazy to pack lunches for the following days. Yes, it is an excuse, but I am that lazy. My middleschool didnt provide lunch so we'd have to pack to eat but they sometimes had snacks for kids who forgot. I would hurridly grab a plastic bag and throw certain kinds of food  and eat that for lunch. Because i am a loner i sat mostly alone but sometimes i was able to sit with the grade below, and they noticed how small my packed lunch was and would ask why but id always reply 'I didnt have time' or 'I forgot' and usually 'Im not hungry', even though my stomach would be growling, unheard by the noise of the lunchroom.
I was able to rid myself of the habit of not eating a certain meal until the end of seventh grade but it came back worse in eigth grade. I would rarely bring anything to school at that point to eat. Before, in 7th grade, I only skipped a certain meal for about a certain amount of time during the middle of the school year.
Eigth grade came and left, with me losing weight in short random amounts, and I had begun to get dizzy sometimes when i engage in unhealthy coping mechanisms, which didnt happen daily at that point at least.
That summer leading to ninth grade I would usually engage in certain unhealthy coping mechanisms. But because I wasnt up and moving a lot during the summer I hadnt noticed how i had begun to get dizzier and dizzier when I would get up.
Ninth grade year, my first year of highschool, I blacked out for the first time in math 2. It was the middle of the year and we were taking a test in math, and one moment I was sitting down looking over the test, the next moment the bell rang and sounds and colors flowed back into me. I glanced back down at my test to see it had mysteriously been filled out by someone, surely not me as I hadnt remembered even filling out the first question. During ninth grade year i had stopped eating certain meals during the day. Everyday I would skip them, even on weekends when my family would make meals so that i didnt have to go through the trouble of making stuff. At that point, it was hard for me to make it up the school stairs to the math and science rooms without having to slow down and rest against a wall for a good 15 seconds. I would make it look like I had suddenly remembered something and began searching my bag or that i was tying my shoe and would rest my head on my knee until the fuzziness and pounding and pulsing in my head and the rest of my body would disappear. Because I was engaging in unhealthy coping mechanisms, the crowded lunchroom too scary for my anxiety filled self to overcome, I would sit along a wall near the lunch room and work on homework instead. When I would stand to go to my next class, Concert Band, I would always stand up too fast and my vision would go black with my hearing fading out.
Now, a 10th grader, it has reached peak point. I do not eat certain  meals throughout the day. I write it off as not having time or being too busy but that didnt pass the attention of my girlfriend. We had met right before the 10th grade school year had started and got together maybe a month after that, and we're now approaching our 5 month anniversary. My beautiful kind girlfriend, she noticed my eating issues. She noticed that i engaged in unhealthy coping mechanisms. She noticed when my weight dropped further and further. She notices, and she is helping. I am trying to get better for her and me, because I am tired of doing this to myself and her, but I believe I need professional help. And I cant get in person therapy, because my parents wouldnt pay for that. Thats a whole other uncovered secret of my life. My parents- they arent the best. Not even close. But basically if I were to tell them I wanted therapy for my Eating Disorder, father would laugh and point and then refuse to pay and mother wouldnt let me because no one is supposed to know Im not her perfect daughter. My girlfriend helps me through all of my issues with parents and eating disorders everyday. She still loves and supports me even though I am now teetering at the edge of underweight. And for that, I am grateful. I am happy she and I were able to meet.
I have other issues but those deal with anxiety and the likes, which do definently have major effects on my eating, but Im not sure if I would be going against community guidelines explaining or describing. All I've wanted for a while was a therapist to just talk to about such issues but I cant have one. And its hurting me but I have to wait until 18 for one.
Other details: Prior to my issue with not eating, I would engaged in other unhealthy coping mechanisms, which made me gain a lot of weight in short periods. This made me feel bad about myself and is that is why i began engaging in other unhealthy coping mechanisms. Now I can only eat small portions or it is too much.
This is my story. Sorry if it seems randomly ordered but I tried my best. School also is a main influencer of my eating, as it stresses me a great amount.

301,Michele1994,02/15/2019,Pain killers and binge eating? ,"Hi everyone. Quick introduction. I have been binge eating for about eight years, but I didn’t realise that I had a problem until maybe a year or two ago, I always thought I just had low to no self control and loved the taste of food. But I started to realise that loving food wasn’t really my motive and when I got into a binge there was something else that came over me. Anyway. Now to today’s question.
I had a shoulder injury at the end of last year and was prescribed a pain killer. While on it, I had literally zero urges to binge eat. Has anyone else had this or a similar experience? I have Googled it and can’t find any related studies. Being on it, especially for a few days, makes me a bit nauseous, which isn’t fun. And I obviously don’t want to become addicted to it or anything. But I can’t help wondering why it helped my get my urges under control? Any help or explanations would be greatly appreciated as I am feeling very lost on this matter.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,02/19/2019-7:18pm",Hello Michele1994 and s,"Hello Michele1994 and s.boewer,  Your comments have been edited to follow our community guidelines.

303,as107,01-10-19,"BED and body image issues, venting and asking for help ","Hey all, sorry in advance for giant rant ahead, I just need to get this out... 28F here. I've had issues with my body and food for essentially my entire life. I was a bit of a chubbier kid, always aware of it, always very excited to eat food. In high school I became more aware that I was overweight and wasn't really desirable as such. I remember having unrequited feelings for guys, and then seeing their thinner, more beautiful girlfriends and thinking they clearly didn't like me as much because of how i looked. I have this vivid memory of one dude saying the words ""ew, gross"" at the suggestion he should date me. Looking back, obviously high school is a terrible, dumb place, but these experiences were powerful for me. So powerful that in college I restricted, dieted, and ran throughout my freshman and sophomore years until I was the smallest I've ever been as an adult, about X lbs on a 5'3"" frame. Eventually I injured myself and couldn't run for a while, and I think that's when my issues with eating sort of kicked into gear. I remember days where I'd only eat certain foods for the entire day because that's what I wanted to eat, but I'd only have a certain amount so I could fit within a calorie goal for the day. Since then (the past 8 years or so), I've essentially lived in this weird space where I'm either counting calories or binging, trying to diet/restrict or doing the opposite. Here and there I've had moments where I have eaten intuitively and it's been okay, but for the most part I feel.. distressed. I got into powerlifting several years ago and that's certainly done wonders for my general health and self confidence, but I've been having a hard time recently. Just this past week, I tried eating X kcal a day for a couple of days, then the past two days I've ended up binging on random food around my apartment until I feel bloated and sick, awful, like I know I always will after I binge. I've been to therapists about this several times in the past, read probably every book under the sun about binge eating/intuitive eating/etc. It's clear my problems with food come from not liking my body. For years I've felt my body just isn't good enough, thin enough, to be attractive to the people I'm attracted to. It's like there's this fear in my head that if I can't be smaller, I'll never be truly lovable by someone I'm actually interested in. It's so... sad... to write it out here, knowing I'm so obsessed with my size and what I eat because of this fear. But I know that fear causes me to restrict, which causes me to binge. In reality, I'm a little overweight, but I know I'm not a particularly big or small size, just average-sized, strong, and relatively healthy. I'm once again exasperated. I don't know how to proceed with eating tomorrow. Do I count calories? Do I eat whatever I want without eating mindfully? Do I try to eat mindfully then kick myself for eating something when I'm not hungry? Do I eat nothing? It feels like I've lived every variation of a day of eating, and I don't know how to find normalcy. I wish I knew how to cope with prolonged hunger so I could lose weight. I wish I knew how to actually let go of caring about the size of my body, tying it to how lovable I am. Sometimes I think I obsess about weight loss because maybe I'm not desirable because of my personality.. so perhaps looking better would make the whole package more appealing to... someone. I currently am a medical student without much money to spare and (ironically?) have terrible insurance. My current inconvenient clinic hours (9-7 M-F) aside, I'm not sure I can even find an ED therapist in my area that I could afford. I'm just.. so tired. Every day is a new day, and every new day I get it wrong. It's weird, generally having my shit together in just about every area of my life except this one. I just want to let go. I want to eat healthy things, normal things, without treating myself every meal nor shying away from treating myself once in a while. It's like there's this normal version of myself I want to exist, but I haven't been able to figure out how to be her. If anyone out there has found success and made peace with their bodies, learned to eat normally, had any similar issues, etc.. I would love to hear from you. Frankly I'd love to hear from you even if you haven't had these issues. I don't want to live like this for my entire life. Sorry for this giant rant.. I'm not sure I've ever actually written out how I truly feel about food and my body because I'm so ashamed. Hope to hear from some of you lovely people soon.

304,serena2019,01/20/2019,don't know if I should get help,"I'm a freshman in college and pretty far from home and far from my brother and Dad so I've been doing a lot worse lately due to lack of accountability. No one knows I'm struggling, so my behaviors are overlooked. Prior to college, I hadn't purged in a long time, and now I'm doing so X times a week. I'm not sure if that's something that warrants help—in the past, I used behaviors with a much higher frequency and went to treatment, and now I feel like I'm not sick enough to need help but stuck in some kind of quasi-recovery where I'm oscillating between nourishing myself and trying to love myself but also hating my body and wanting to change it. I know getting support can't hurt me recovery-wise, but I'm not sure if I'm justified in getting it because therapy is just so expensive, and my student insurance doesn't cover much. Also I know most of you are probably not medical professionals, but does anyone know if it's an issue if I'm purging and there's a little blood?

After a lap I met them for stretching exercises. At that time my chest began to tighten and seemed to have a severe cramp-pressured feeling until it went back inside after class.

I wanted to warn him so ran and signed to him about his car door. Then I walked home and all the way home my heart was beating hard. When I got home I became dizzy and weak. I was alone and my heart was beating very quickly. I even took a warm shower b4 eating dinner and after stirring the dessert was preparing for my class I became dizzy again.

308,Jennj,02-11-19,Looking for strength ,"My last true binge was 2/1 so about 9 days. I was so proud of myself I made it a week. I faced some triggers head on and was able to cope. Last night I got the urge to binge. When my husband would leave the room I would sneak handfuls of what I could from the pantry. This happened a few times. I kept telling myself I would let him go up to bed first and had grand plans in my head for my binge but then came to and decided to go up to bed. I was proud of my decision that I was able to change my habits without falling all the way down the rabbit hole. Yea, I wasn’t great, but this was not a binge for me. It didn’t make me feel sick at least and I regained control of myself. The issue is now I can’t sleep and all I can thinking is how I robbed myself of what I really wanted and how can I make up for it tomorrow. I’m finding myself now wanting to plan a binge and am giddy. I know that’s not the right mentality but am having a hard time now changing my mindset. What are some tools you use to stop yourself? It’s my birthday this week and although I’m married and have friends / family close by I still feel very alone. Then when all together I feel judged on how I eat if I go for multiples of desser and I just want one day to myself where I can celebrate my birthday how I want without hearing a word from anyone. Then I sit here wondering why I’d rather dodge plans with friends or family to binge in private. Is it the shame?  I just don’t know how to break this cycle. I know I need to be more concerned with my health - I actually do have a serious health problem unrelated to this - and should take better care of myself but it is just so hard. And no one understands. When I try to talk to my husband and share what’s going on on a smaller scale he just doesn’t get it and just says you won’t change if you don’t make changes. Well, no sh*t but it’s not that easy and people don’t understand that it’s a much deep rooted issue. I just need someone out there to tell me it’s ok to have one slip up and move on. I don’t need to start my week on a bad note by letting it turn into a binge. My birthday is in 5 days and I should go into happy and wanted to enjoy instead of shameful for my secret binges leading up to it. I just wish I had someone I knew in person to call or lean on. I’m starting to feel distant from all my friends and family because I’m living this secret life no one knows about. I lie to my husband and make up stories about errands to go and binge and sit in a parking lot where no would know and bounce from place to place until I’m so sick then because he doesn’t know I have to put on a happy face and still make dinner and eat like everything is ok. Well, it’s not Ok I don’t know how to do fix it.

309,Jadzia28,02-07-19,"New here, advice appreciated :)","I’m new to these forums and this is my first time ever writing something like this. And I’m just looking for some people who can understand what I’m feeling.
So I've never been happy with my body. In October I started eating less where it would only be a certain amount a day. Sometimes I would lose control, but I would never be able to make myself engage in unhealthy coping mechanisms.
However, it got to the point where at night I couldn’t control the cravings and I lost control more often. It got to the point where I eventually started to engage in unhealthy coping mechanisms to make me feel less guilt about what I ate.
It would get rid of the stress and bad feelings and leave me feeling calm for a couple minutes after.
I never thought bad about it, but I told my boyfriend and he was speechless. He cried, told me I shouldn’t be doing this to myself, and begged me to stop hurting myself.
I stopped so I wouldn’t cause problems for us. After, I got a bit better where the thoughts didn’t control me anymore. But sometimes I would slip up and engage in unhealthy coping mechanisms.
That was my mind for a couple of months.
Until the new year, I made a commitment to lose weight. In the beginning, I went crazy and counted every calorie making sure I stayed under. And if I went over, I would engage in unhealthy coping mechanisms. It drove me crazy and was all I could think about. But I was losing weight so why would I stop?
When school started again, I lost focus and slacked. It made me gain back the weight.
But the stress of school, getting perfect grades, and band made me go back to my habits. It got really bad and I started seeing things changing. It started affecting my relationships.
I had crazy mood swings with my boyfriend and my family. And I physically noticed differences. I started looking paler. I physically became so tired much easier. My skin became dry when it was usually oily. My hair feels thinner, and I saw cavities ( and I never get cavities). My upper throat would feel swollen and I saw burns on the inside of my mouth. Not to mention how it affected me mentally.
But even with everything I saw, I couldn’t stop myself from coming home and engaging in unhealthy coping mechanisms. If I lost control, I would engage in unhealthy coping mechanisms when the cravings were irresistible.
A friend I told and my boyfriend don't understand and tell me to ""just stop because it's so stupid. Why would you do that to yourself?"". I also can't tell my mom because she doesn't believe in mental disorders.
Also, the mood swings were too hard for my boyfriend.  Where he told me he needed a break. The thing that made it worse was he said my “eating disorder” was a bit of the problem.
That was just four days ago, but this breakup is affecting me so so hard where I haven't stopped crying and feeling guilty for making my behavior need for him to take a break. And I feel like the breakup is fueling my problem.
I am wondering if I should get help? But I know I wouldn't know how or want to if I'm seeing results. The weight I’ve lost and the things I do are my coping mechanisms to this breakup.
I’m all alone and I can’t stop myself. I don’t know what to do, and I hope someone who might understand what I'm going through to give me some advice.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,02/10/2019-4:08pm",Post Edited,"Hi Jadzia28,  We are glad to hear that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

310,blahblahblah,01/31/2019,Edema after binging,So I went on a long period of time where I was binging (I only binge when I’m using other unhealthy coping mechanisms) anyway this happens every now and then and I often gain a lot of water weight (this time a certain amount of weight) and I always lose the water weight within a certain amount of time (so it’s NOT real wieight) it’s basically just really bad edema. I’m wondering if anyone else experienced this from binging- I received skepticism from my therapist essentially just saying she flat out didn’t believe me and disbelief from my GP. This for me is INFURIATING that clinicians and doctors have an insane lack of understanding when it comes to an eating disorder.

311,Esmith91894 ,02-06-19,Binging in recovery ,Hey everyone was hoping that posting here might get me some feedback and some help. I've been recovering from Ed since early October last year so it's been probably 4 months. My eating disorder consisted of me cutting my calories and would exercise every day in multiple sessions Sunday through Thursday. When Friday started I would fast all day long and when it got to be about 7 at night I would eat something and start chugging alcohol to drop my guard. I then would proceed to binge eat the whole entire house Friday night and then go through the same process Saturday. When I would wake up Sunday all it took was 1 look in the mirror and I'd be back on the treadmill trying to make up for my weekend. Well when I first started recovery the binging was non stop whether I drank or not. I knew that it was a normal sign in recovery and after a month or so I actually started to feel full for the first time in years. I took that to mean I was finally back at a natural weight plus I my testosterone rebounded I was so excited. A few more weeks passed still not restricting diet but not binging on junk every day either. Well for the last 2 months I've been trying to eat clean and work out again and was having great success I'm stronger and bigger now than I've ever been. I even quit drinking alcohol at the start of the new year. My problem? I still cant stop binging.. all it takes is 3 days of clean eating even though I'm eating plenty of calories and I'll find myself waking up in the middle of the night running to the kitchen for my junk food. I'm really not certain what to do is this normal will it ever go away? The binge sessions and the way I look and feel after are the only things that ever make me feel like I would go back to my miserable ways of cutting weight. Any help or reply is greatly appreciated. Other than my mom dad and sister I'm fighting this alone and sometimes it's just nice to get some reassurance.,_admin_moderator,"Thu,02/07/2019-12:28pm",Hello Esmith91894 and welcome,"Hello Esmith91894 and welcome to the forums! We are glad to hear that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

313,ankaszutek,01/30/2019,getting it off my chest.,"Hi everyone!
I'm literally shaking as I'm writing this. Also, I'd like to apologize for my grammar in advance, as English is not my native language. So I found this forum like 15 minutes ago and decided to just get this weight off my mind.
My story began about a year ago, so not so in the past as one may say. I was this typical teenage girl who wanted to lose some weight as the summer was coming. I signed up to the gym and decided to go on a diet.  I lost weight maintained my weight until one of my relative's communion. There was a lot of food, let me just say this. And I ate a lot. I even cried out because I felt bad for myself when I wanted to eat more.
The time passed and slowly, first twice a month, then once a day (every day) I had my binging episode. I ate until my chest hurt from the amount of food I put into my mouth and it was hard for me to breathe. It continued for a quite some time. I told my parents about it after 5 months or so. I decided to go to a dietitian. But let me tell you this, no diet will help you if you can't commit. I was diagnosed with insulin resistance which is not so severe but could lead to diabetes, which is common in my family. So yeah, I wasn't able to stick to a diet for longer than 3 days. I eventually resigned.
What are you doing now, one may ask. Well, I try, but fruitlessly. Every morning is like a fresh start for me until I see something I'm craving, then I can't stop.  Eventually, I gained weight. Just imagine how bad I feel right now, as this number is increasing.
I decided to write this post because I feel It could help me a little bit. Getting it off my chest. And maybe tomorrow will be THE day, who knows. Also, I'd like to say that I'm glad I am not the only one struggling and I was thrilled when I saw this place. Cuz there are people that are willing to help me; these blessed beings want to hear and listen to me. The fact that I am able to write my feelings down is great and I feel relieved.
So yeah, I guess that's it. I hope this will be the only time I speak on this forum as a sufferer and maybe next time I'll be able to actually help someone. Okay, pray for me guys~! Because I'm tired and disgusted by myself. I know that it's important to love yourself, I've heard all his positive body image bs but it's not what I want to think about right now. I want to stop eating those amounts. That's all.
Blessings!",_admin_moderator,"Thu,01/31/2019-12:45pm",Hello ankaszutek and welcome,"Hello ankaszutek and welcome to the forums.

314,jhutch,01/31/2019,BED help pls,"I've always had a lot of struggle with food and eating. Something pretty bad happened over the summer and I started to srsly binge and eat alot to cope. I've gained so much weight over the past 6 months and it's really taken a toll on my self confidence and self image. Like I hate the way I look and I avoid looking in mirrors. It got a little better for like three weeks, but now because of midterms and everything, its gotten a lot worse. I've been eating so much, stress eating and just binge eating cus it's almost a habit at this point. It makes me feel so shitty about myself and distracts me from studying well. My grades have started to drop too and its rlly bad.I just recently got a boyfriend, and he's super supportive and everything, but whenever I see him talking to another girl I get so paranoid almost, because everyone is so much skinnier and better looking than I am, and it makes me feel so shitty and self conscious, and then when I get home, I end up binging again.

316,Charliebarr,01/24/2019,Looking for a friend/support ,"I was diagnosed with non purging bulimia with occasion purging bulimia about 4 months ago. I have an extreme pre-occupation with food. I am doing a lot better since the start of my recovery I have gone from extremely unhealthy coping mechanisms to being able to at least eat and exercise in a more moderate way. However, I have just arrived back at college and with added stress of school and being away from home and not having a structured schedule I seem to have more episodes of binge eating that leads me to fasting or doing obsessive amounts of cardio. I have severe guilt when I consume food that I feel is “unhelathy” but I’m slowly working towards expanding my diet and improving my relationship with food. I hope that if I can find a buddy who is also dealing with an eating disorder we could help each other out.

317,beckye,01/20/2019,I don't feel like I have anorexia,"I was diagnosed in March 2018 that I had anorexia, but for so many reasons I don't believe I do!
I've done months of FBT which was a nightmare as my family is a mess and I refused all help and meals etc. and found it too controlling and harsh. I started CBT very recently, but I feel like I don't even need to go, because I can't help eating lots in the evenings.
I call them ""binges"" though apparently the calorie content isn't quite enough for that- but it definitely feels that way.
I really struggle to eat throughout the day, then at a certain point during the day, suddenly feel like I have to eat.
Dinner as well isn't. challenge for me. I'm able to eat it just fine, and afterwards I even have a small bit of whatever dessert is on offer... but after dinner I find that I can't control myself. I'll end up picking at leftovers until I've eaten whole portions, or I'll eat foods that during the day are terrifying and I would never eat. It always ends in guilt and feeling miserable and trying to sleep it off (I have a fear of sick so have never purged), and the next day is the same.
I felt like I had Night Eating Syndrome, which I don't according to my therapist, or BED (again, i don't)
I feel like I don't deserve to be in recovery treatment because I don't engage with it and I feel like my behaviour isn't that of a real anorexic!

319,Michele1994,01/25/2019,Not Much to do with Emotions ,"Hello! This is my first time posting and I am doing it because I am really stuck. I have read a lot of stories and don’t really relate to any of them.
I am definitely a binge eater. I only discovered it recently but thinking back I have been doing it for almost eight years.
I am a bit over weight, but am comfortable in my skin. I do not try to eat less or restrict my calories (although I did in the passed, but never excessively). I eat tonnes. I live with my boyfriend - he doesn’t know about all this. So in the beginning it was difficult for me to binge. But know that I have realized that he is incredibly unobservant, I binge more than ever. I still eat normal sized meals a certain amount of times per day and then binge on top of that. I occasionally purge but only when I am feeling incredibly sick, otherwise I don’t do anything about it. I am quickly getting fatter. I live a fairly active lifestyle and people are always surprised that I don’t eat so much in public but am quite chubby. I am very embarrassed and never want my family knowing about my disorder.
But I can’t contain myself and I don’t even feel that guilty for doing it. I am wasting all my money on food to binge on. Last month I ran out of money and ate a certain amount of food because there was nothing else sweet in the house. I really need help as I have tried everything I can think of and it’s just getting worse.

I then compensate by not eating much for a couple days- or going on a diet and setting aside one day to consume an unhealthy amount of food.I am 16 years old, and I have been struggling with this for about 6 years that I can remember. It only gets worse as my mom has known for years about my “unhealthy habits” as she has found piles of wrappers in my room but she doesn’t know the extent of my problem. My mom is a huge problem to me mentally as she criticizes the way I look, as I have slowly put on weight over the years.Sorry for the long jumbled rant- I just suddenly felt like I needed to tell someone about this.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,01/24/2019-1:03pm",Welcome to the forums,"Welcome to the forums Beachykeen, we are glad you are here seeking support.Have you taken a look at some of the resources the NEDA online website has?

326,jammy_pluto,01/21/2019,What do I do?,"I'm not sure if I even have an eating disorder. I mean, I guess I have the signs but part of me thinks I can stop anytime i want to. But I restrict my food, and when i can i fast. If i eat too much occasionally I'll throw up, but whenever i eat i feel guilty and fat. I secretly bought myself a scale i hide so my mom doesn't find out, and when i see i gain weight i feel so terrible. I lose a lot of hair now, too. Which i didn't use to. It's been like this since last summer. I even went vegetarian as an excuse to not eat with my family.
Like a few months ago i was constantly having dizzy spells and was always tired, and one morning i stood up and when i was walking to the bathroom i was dizzy and couldn't see and collapsed, my body was doing some weird uncontrollable
wild shaking.
I still get dizzy spells fairly often, but it's back to being really bad like that one day I collapsed and standing is so hard I feel like i'm going to just break, but i don't want to collapse again.
I'm not sure what to do. I'm really scared. the school nurse mentioned to my mom a few weeks ago i might have an eating disorder, my mom laughed it off but if I collapse she might think i do.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,01/24/2019-12:30pm",Hello jammy_pluto and welcome,"Hello jammy_pluto and welcome to the forums.

327,-Unknown-,01-12-19,Tired of it all,"Hello everyone! It's my first post here because I really need to talk to ""somebody"" about my ED and I don't feel comfortable to share it with my friends or my parents, because they don't really know what's going on.
I'm currently 20 years old and it all started when I was 16. Up until then, I didn't care at all about how I looked and what I was eating, and I wasn't underweight (I've always been thin). In 2014, I noticed that everyone was getting in the mood to be healthier and leaner, so I decided maybe I should start exercising and eating better. Long story short, I ended up working out more (but only for 3 weeks or so) and eating too little. I think it was the less I've ever been in that period. I was never diagnosed with an eating disorder because I wasn't really anorexic, but I lost my period and I really needed to put the weight back in. Also, I fell into depression and started taking antidepressants.
One year after reaching my lowest weight, I got my period back and regained weighed. My eating habits changed because I kept on eating healthier, though. So, I thought I had recovered and even tried to stop taking the antidepressants, but when I went to college my depression attacked once again and I started eating less again, but I didn't really lose a lot of weight and I had my period most of the time.
Now, this year is leaving my annoyed and frustrated as hell. Instead of living like a normal person, I can't stop thinking about what I eat and I started binge-eating, specially at night. I know that a solution would be to just eat more frequently throughout the day, but I only enjoy eating when I'm really hungry, not just a little bit hungry, even though I feel bad and disgusting after that. That is one of my problems.The bottom line is: I'm tired of thinking about what I eat and what others eat. I'm also tired of going on social media and seeing everyone losing weight and getting fit because I think I should do the same, yet I really shouldn't... I like how I look. I guess I'm just scared of gaining weight, but I'm also scared of starving myself and losing weight, so my eating habits are getting crazy.
Thank you so, so much for reading this... and PLEASE HELP ME if you can. I don't know what to do anymore. Thanks once more.

328,kmurphy777,01/22/2019,Running and Exercising Struggles,"Hi there, After being in denial of my restricting and purging via exercise for a few months now, I have come to terms with the fact that I do have an ED and I am in the process of getting treatment. Everything began to spiral out of control for me back in September when I started a diet and started ""healthily"" incorporating exercise into my life several days a week. These exercises quickly became more and more intense and if I didn't run a certain amount a day, I failed and I was very upset with myself. From what I have heard in this beginning stage of recovery, it is not a good decision to continue forward with this exercise and honestly it is the most terrifying part of this whole process. I understand that the pressure I put on exercise was/is unhealthy, but it feels very uncomfortable to not even have the freedom to run/workout at all because I did enjoy my runs as a stress reliever. I guess I was just wondering if anyone else in recovery has experienced any similar struggles/disappointment. It really has been bringing me down and being deprived of it makes me want to run that much more.

I need a hair trim and a coloring job but in this weather feel stuck indoors. I also feel guilty to go anywhere on a day when I haven't accepted a teaching job assignment, like today for instance...I am planning to go visit a local beauty college soon. Last I went there they did a very good job. I had 1 dresser who was working w/ me for months. Then 1 day I went for my usual  Saturday hair trim and she had graduated and moved on in the world. I liked her as a hairdresser and actually hoped to go to her new place of business after she had graduated. So that feeling of losing someone I befriend is difficult for me to handle...I just need to get used to driving over there to the beauty college once again. its all about routines in my life. I suppose I'm like a cat. Animals like routines, as do children, and even I do too.My weight is still flexing over my comfort zone. I need to find some alt foods to switch to from this 1 food I use daily. I find myself constipated way too often.I work a 5 hr shift tonight. Tomorrow I am still hoping to pick up a decent teaching job, and then am due at my mall job from 4-8-ish.Still feeling anxious as I am writing this entry here.I hate to be so GOAL DRIVEN but currently, I am totally feeling this need for my goal driven daily routines. I think my background history of being athletically competitive and involved in different sports from age 9-15, and 18-35-ish for routine lap swim classes was what kept me super disciplined for many mouthful years of my life.I can't ever allow myself to wander astray from my routines of exercise and self-discipline because when I do is when my anxiety increases and I feel extra yucked out and that's not how I like to feel usually.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,01/17/2019-6:21pm",Editing note ,"Hi, chunkymonkey68, part of your post was edited due to specific details that might be triggering for others.

330,Stephanieo2000,01-07-19,Figuring Out My Disorder; Need Help with Easy-to-eat Foods,"Hi everyone, This is my first time on this forum and I’m really excited as I’m looking forward to a lasting recovery with everyone’s help. I have lots of background for you all to consider, but mostly am looking for assistance in finding foods that are easy to prepare and eat. I have a problem when it comes to chewing food a lot, so I like to have softer foods. I’m still in the process of determining exactly what my disorder is, as I do eat, but I don’t like to. I’ve been raised with an “eat to live, don’t live to eat” mentality, plus a single dad (who is amazing) that doesn’t have the best cooking skills. I’m learning to cook and have helped him, just as much as he’s trying to help me. I’m 18, 5’5” and about X lbs, and am trying to get to X. The heaviest I’ve been is X. As more background, I do struggle with pretty severe anxiety and cyclical depression usually around the holidays and May, when my mom passed away years back. These times suck especially because they’re end of semester, and this is usually when I tend to get extra stressed as well, and end up losing weight. In years past, I usually lose about X pounds when the depression hits, and gain it back a couple of months after, and then it hits again. It’s exhausting. I know I’m underweight even at my highest weight, but I cannot manage to put on the weight nor maintain it for more than a couple of months. Because I know I do eat, and I will, and I just don’t enjoy it, the help I’m looking for are easy to prepare recipes or foods, that are also easy to eat. I am lazy and unmotivated when going through my depressive episodes, and need stuff that is easily accessible and high in calories or nutrition. Please feel free to ask any questions necessary to help me better and I will get back to you ASAP I greatly appreciate everyone’s forthcoming advice. Best to everyone!",_admin_moderator,"Wed,01/09/2019-6:22pm",Editing note ,"Hi, stephanieo2000, glad to see that you're looking forward to being on the forums!

331,Selizabeth22,01-09-19,Taking my first step towards recovering from Bulimia ,"Hi Everyone, Today my boyfriend and I had a serious talk about the eating disorder that has been running and ruining my life. I have been struggling with binging/purging for a little over 2 years now. I was a victim of domestic violence and things seemed to spiral from there. Once me and my present boyfriend got together things seemed to get a lot better and then all of a sudden I started to notice myself having the constant urge to lose weight but not having time to go to the gym or eat healthy as I was in school at the time and working 2 jobs. As soon as I saw weight loss from binging/purging without having to do the work It seemed to overwhelm my life and now I cant eat a normal meal without the anxiety that follows it to find a bathroom and make sure no one notices. My boyfriend and I live together now which caused him to realize how serious this is. I am now only X pounds at 5'7 and havent been this skinny since middle/school or high school. I understand that this is a serious problem and I do really want to get help but my obsession with my appearance and weight are stopping me from completely giving in to recovery. Other than my Boyfriend who is urging me to get help and being extremely supportive my family and friends do not know. They constantly tell me that I look ""good' or ""in shape"" and think that I am just exercising and eating right. I have been looking into finding a therapist that will work for me and am looking for suggestions as to what type of therapists or therapy will help? Or what my next steps should be to get a hold of these urges and work towards a more healthy lifestyle. Any advice and encouragement helps.

332,DeadSouls,01/17/2019,An internal war,"My name is Amy and I am struggeling heavily with my eating disorder. I feel so isolated and the feeling of being a ghost. I am completely alone in this and people around me don't care and they don't see me. It's the feeling of being completely alone, feeling numb, apathetic, dead from the inside. People see my body, but they don't see my panic, my struggles when it comes to weight and food. So most people who would see me think I am fine because I don't lost a lot of weight yet.
I am stuck in a body and a life that I don't want to be in anymore. It makes me really depressed.There is nobody in real life and I struggled so much with my past that is really hard to function anymore. I struggle with it everyday. I never talk about it with anyone. So from the outside everything looks okay. But to be really honoust, I punish myself for everything that happend and I am destroying my body. Never do I ask for help, but I feel so alone in this and like being in a prison.
It made me realize that it's absurd to fight against an eating disorder alone.
It's way to heavy. It's just difficult to get help where I live, so that's why I come here. It's not easy to get the right person or treatment, to solve it without support from family or friends, that's something I care carry for a while, but it's becoming to much for me. I cannot do this alone anymore.Something in my mind wants to go on, wants to live, wants to have a family, a life, to have energy, to go everywhere that you want to go. I want to start living again but I feel that my enviroment suppress my sensitivity. I cannot live in cruelty, where people have their own lifes, look at you and laugh at you because you don't have the things they have.Never did I have a stable basis in my live or an example.
I always had to figure out alone how to deal with things.
That's really hard because people expect so much these days, and do to everything alone that is impossible. Everybody has a mother, a father, a brother, sister, friends, work, etc.
The things you need on this planet, I didn't have them when I was young, and I still don't have it, so I feel so lost. Like being alone on the dark, cold streets looking at a window with Christmas and you see other family's being together in their warm, cozy house, having a nice time, laughing, making jokes, giving each other love and presents. They have their children, loved ones, pets. Etc.It's so easy to say that you have to be happy on your own. And although I sound so negative now, this is not who I am. I really try to see things positive and to keep busy, to change things in my life. But it's almost impossible, because of the fact that I am ignored and rejected by people.
If I have so many dreams in my mind, but then there is no motivation, there is no love, no sensitivity. There is only the feeling of being ignored, being alone, not understood.
But my body doesn't have the energy anymore, it's really exhausted. It's really difficult to have a normal, stable, healty life and it feels like my body is giving up. My mind is positive most of the time, and I feel that their is some sort of hope.
That things will be better one day.
I just don't know what to do anymore?
The thoughts about my body, the food, it takes me over completeley. I don't expect anything but I wanted to tell what's on my mind. All those feelings and emotions about my past, being  supressed, being alone, ignored, the way you have to look these days by society. It triggerd this demon inside of me. Who is so angry at the situation and also on my self, that I feel that I am against a wall and the only control that I have is the eating disorder. My thoughts are so heavy, extreme and dark that it's feels like the only way to cope with my feelings. It exhausts my body and mind and but something in me still doesn't want to give up!Normally I don't talk about anything what is on my mind, I am extremely closed but on the moment I have the feeling that I will explode, I cannot keep this for myself any longer and I hope to receive some support, nice words, comfort, help.Thank you so much for reading my story and I hope we can support each other with our internal wars.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,01/17/2019-12:41pm",Hello DeadSouls and welcome,"Hello DeadSouls and welcome to the forums! We are sorry to hear you’re struggling with eating concerns and have experienced difficulty finding treatment . You are not alone in facing this obstacle.

333,deedee0705,01/20/2019,Finally getting help with my bulimia,"Years ago I had an issue with binging and purging but it never got out of hand.  I had started to engage in unhealthy coping mechanisms and eating a lot.  I was in a relationship with someone who also did the same type of unhealthy coping mechanisms and all we did was the unhealthy coping mechanisms and eat, so I somehow found a way to stop the binging and purging.  Let's jump ahead ten years now.  I had a very hectic year in 2018.  My nana passed away, my cousin was diagnosed with a stage four terminal cancer, and I got kicked out of my place for a certain reason when I was told not to but did anyways.  In August of 2018, I had a close friend of mine tell me like it is.  She told me I needed to get my life together and stop engaging in the unhealthy coping mechanisms.  I started to slowly stop myself from engaging in the unhealthy coping mechanisms and that's when the bulimia came back.  It was something I had control over and something I was able to focus on.  It was not bad at first.  I finally stopped doing this certain type of unhealthy coping mechanism on October 19th after I was in a bad car accident that totaled my car.  I started eating better and going to the gym more and I lost some weight, which everyone noticed.  It made me feel good.  This is when my bulimia got to be at its worst.  All I think about is how many calories I'm consuming in a day and going to the gym.  When I do eat healthy, I barely eat.  It's the same foods every time I eat.  But if I eat something that isn't healthy, I can't help but purge.  Once I eat something bad, I just continue until I feel like absolute garbage. I can't stop, though. I recently told my doctor who then put me on an anti-anxiety medicine to help my obsessive thoughts.  It's been a week now.  I've also joined in on an online chat support group that happens Wednesday evenings and it was such an eye-opener.  I don't know how to think any other way.

I've been singing and purging for a certain amount of time now. I was doing it more frequently and then less frequently. But with school just starting back up I've had a certain amount of episodes. I've never experienced an eating disorder before. When I get the thought to binge it is all consuming. And even though I know I won't feel better afterwards, I still can't stop. I've told my boyfriend about it, but I don't let him on when I've had an episode. So he doesn't know how often I do it. I work 3 12hr shifts of the weekend, and am in nursing school the other 4. I know I should find a therapist, but I dont really know where to start. I don't live in a well populated area that has many people that specialize in ED. I guess I'm just looking for some advice.

They are so supportive especially my parents but I feel like I don’t have anyone to talk to that really gets it. I do have an appointment to see a therapist that specializes in eating disorders but I can’t get in until mid feb. just thought I would try to come on here where people have been through similar situations.

337,Tarheel1486,01/17/2019,Frustrated ,"Hello Everyone,
I am bulimic and have been for 5 years. I realize How bad this is for me.  I would have times I wouldn’t purge but recently realized I have to stop. I haven’t had a episode in a certain amount of time. However, I am overweight. I want to get healthy and lose this weight the right way. I used to be able to lose weight quickly when I was eating healthy and exercising. In a certain amount of time I have been eating healthy and exercising and every time I get on the scale I’ve only lost a certain amount of weight. I’m really afraid I have completely messed up my metabolism and didn’t know if this is normal? Have others suffering from bulimia and trying to lose weight the correct way had this problem? If anyone has any insight on this subject I truly appreciate it as it  has been a real struggle not to purge.",_admin_moderator,"Sun,01/20/2019-3:22pm",Post Edited,"Hi Tarheel1486,We are glad to hear that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

338,Astarael,01/15/2019,Realizing I have BED,"I’m not sure what people really share about themselves but my name is Mandy, I’m 24. Originally I had bulimia starting from 6th grade but managed to conquer it on my own and by going to a group at my high school. I guess I just never realized that instead of fixing it, it turned into something else that took me until very recently to truly accept which is binge eating disorder. I have state insurance and I know very few places that would actually be helpful that would take it so I’m turning to this forum to help me understand it. I’ve been on meds and in therapy for most of my life but have managed without either and was doing well for close to 5 years but now I’ve realized what I’ve been pretending isn’t there. I have all the tools to help myself and I don’t have a problem setting up a healthy meal plan, understanding good food is most foods, and I know restricting isn’t the answer and all that. After reaching my highest weight in ever essentially I realized I need to buckle down and make changes, which I did in a healthy way, for almost three months. I was losing weight at a healthy rate, eating until I was satisfied instead of boardering sick but then I went to Florida in October and it all fell apart. I guess being out of what in my mind was in my control was too much and now I’m back to eating ridiculously large amounts of food, in my opinion, until I’m sick and feeling depressed, anxious. I thought it was just a funk but it’s been a couple months. I’m fighting to make baby steps and not give up but I’m not really sure how to fix compulsive eating. I know this was a long post but I’d really really appreciate everyone’s thoughts.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,01/15/2019-11:12am",Welcome to the Forums,"Dear Asterael, Welcome to the forums!

I went out the door Monday to work w/o having taken any of my daily rx's, chomped down on a binge food, during a mini-binge and broke a cosmetic filling in my tooth which was not cheap to have restored the 1st time the tooth was""Restored"" I stepped on the scale and was further stressed to see my numbers were up quite a few above my ""Acceptable"" area for a safe weight for my ""Comfort Zone."" Probably a post-binge consequence, oh well.... I have begun to exercise after work again. Remember my foot had problems for a MONTH that caused me to stop---ENTIRELY---from any walking exercise. God did that feel awful. A month w/o any exercise, except picking up clothes off the floor and fitting rooms at work. As a result, I am now, having to sweat over this weight gain resulting a month later...I'm just feeling powerless, and really grossed out until I begin exercising again, a few times a week, i guess???? I now am also dealing with a scratchy abrased eye which I don't have time to go and see a Dr for eye drops about. I'm praying hard that God will just heal my eye as soon as possible and save both me and the eye Dr unnecessary time from this eye abrasion bordering my grey iris and the cornea next to it. Pray for my healing, please... I had childhood type nightmares last night of being the tag along, kid sister, and running away from ""Killer Bees"" that were chasing me each time I would enter the front door at a relatives place of employment when i was like 4 or something.

342,deuxchartreuse,01-08-19,afraid of treatment,"I've read many posts here but haven't found any that relate to my current situation. I began outpatient treatment in the fall but was eventually recommended for a higher level of care. I am terrified. I previously recovered with only outpatient therapy and my own will power, as I could not afford any additional resources at that time, and there were no alternatives available in my city at that time. So when I relapsed recently and sought help again, I had no clue higher level of care might be necessary. I'm basically not allowed to remain outpatient. If I don't agree to IOP, then I will be kicked out of the treatment center where I've been receiving help. I like my therapist and believe she has helped me immensely, and I'm confused and distressed about being forced into making this decision. I haven't found my sessions with the dietitian to be helpful at all, and I don't think I can follow the rigid guidelines and schedule of IOP. I don't even know if I am ready to or want to. They have told me there are no unexcused absences allowed at all. I don't know how I can keep up with work and all my other obligations in addition to spending 14 hours a week in IOP, plus travel time. I have no support from friends or family. I know this is a wonderful opportunity to finally conquer my eating disorder--one that was not previously available to me, and that many other people lack access to. But knowing that doesn't help me feel differently. I honestly feel like all the stress around IOP is making things worse, and I am tempted to just quit, but I'm also afraid of what might happen when I am completely alone again.Has anyone else experienced this type of high anxiety around treatment? Do you have any tips or advice for how to conquer these feelings?

Rewind to when I was 15 - at high school, I used to make myself sick - because I loved food that much, I couldn’t diet and that was my way of controlling my weight... so being sick has never bothered me... I have food allergies which I am not very strict on, and would make me vomit, and then vomiting became a habit. I don’t like feeling full, I don’t like never being hungry.

351,OwlLover23,12/26/2018,Please Help,"I’ve looked everywhere, but honestly, I’m so confused. So I’m coming here as a last resort, because I can’t just go to the doctor’s on my own.
For years, I’ve been engaging in behaviors to dispose of my food and eating very little.I will however, have lunch on days where people could tell if I wasn’t eating. Though when I don’t have lunch, I’m usually around friends, but I could really only call them acquaintances at best. On the days where it’s be obvious if I didn’t eat, however, I’ll tend to make it look like I ate by engaging in behaviors to hide food.
The habit of hiding food started earlier this year. The rest has been going on since before I knew it was wrong. But now, I almost feel glad I have these behaviors. Like it’s a preventative measure of me gaining weight. I’m not underweight for my age, according to my BMI. I’m definitely on the lower end, but I’ve never been in the underweight range. But I still feel I’m not good enough. I need to be skinnier. Most of all, I can not allow myself to gain weight, though I’m barely hanging in there. I don’t exercise really at all. Nor do I purge, or binge. This is what’s throwing me off the most. I do none of that. But most of the day, my stomach is rumbling,  even though I’ve always eaten this little.
But that used to be an innocent habit. Now, I realize what I’m doing, and want to use it to my advantage, to stay at my definition of a desirable weight. I’ll engage in behaviors to hide not eating if I have to. It’s hard to hide, especially with a horrible memory, preventing me from remembering where I hide half of the food anyways. But I try. I don’t know if this could even be classified as an eating disorder, despite all the research I’ve done. I’ve even taken official tests, suggesting Bulimia, but the actions don’t apply.
I suppose this information may help as well. I have been diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and have been feeling quite depressed this past month, and have had... dark thoughts. I feel so many things are wrong with myself. Though I’m concerned with grades (despite being one of the highest in my class) and my position in life, my weight is one of my largest concerns.
Here’s a quick recap:
-(Barely) healthy weight
-Eating very little, and behaviors to dispose of food
-Desire to stay under weight, and getting upset at self when I get closer to that number, trying to find clever ways to avoid eating food without others noticing
-Not feeling good enough for anyone, despite
I truly thank anyone who replies. I really need help, to know what to do. I see a therapist for my anxiety, but I know she doesn’t specialize in this, and I’m just too scared to tell her anything, because I don’t want people finding out. And I can’t just go to the doctor myself, because I’d need to schedule an appointment through my parents, and that’s just requiring me to face one of my largest fears... But I’m scared. I want to try and fix this before it’s too late.

353,daisymay,12/21/2018,Possible tool for avoiding temptation and relapse -- would like feedback please!,"I was doing some online research about binge-eating disorder because I am an active binge-eater and have been desperately trying to break out of my current binge-eating cycle and figure out how to prevent getting stuck back in one. I just stumbled onto a concept that I think may be immensely helpful and immediately wanted to share it and hopefully get some feedback about how to use it. Briefly, let me explain the concept and how I stumbled onto it. Then I'll tell you how I've started to try to use it. Basically, all humans, and especially addicted humans (whether it be a food addiction, drugs, gambling, whatever), are susceptible to preferring an immediate award over a delayed, larger award. In other words, it's very tempting to choose to receive $5 now rather than get $30 if we wait 10 days.  (Substitute whatever rewards and lengths of time make sense to you.) The scientific term for the behavior of preferring the immediate, smaller award is called ""delay discounting"". We are ""discounting"" the ""delayed"", larger reward (whether it be more money or staying sober) in preference for the immediate, smaller reward. This is not the concept that got me all excited and prompted me to post here. What got me all excited is the concept that's scientifically called ""explicit-zero reframing"". I had absolutely no clue what that meant and had to read and learn about it, so let me break it down. By reframing the choice, it is made explicitly clear that if we choose the immediately available, smaller reward that we will not get the delayed reward. Of course, intuitively, we understand that already, but studies have shown that when a choice is presented using explicit-zero reframing, people ""exhibited significantly lower levels of impulsiveness"". We are able to resist the impulse and choose the delayed reward! As I said, I got excited and immediately wanted to share the idea, so I haven't really done that much research about it yet. So here's how I've started to try to apply the concept... If I'm driving home from class (I'm a college student) and am tempted to stop and buy food and engage in a binge, here are the ways I could think about the choice: a) bingeing: The pros: I would get temporary relief by numbing my feelings by occupying my mind with food-seeking, eating, and feeling sick afterward. Additionally, because I would feel sick afterward, I could justify not engaging in behaviors later that day like going to the gym, hanging out with friends, or whatever. The cons: I would be mad at myself and feel sick and overly full today, stay stuck in my binge-eating cycle b) not binge today: The pros: I would be proud of myself and feel good today, and make progress toward breaking out of my binge-eating cycle The cons: I would not get that temporary relief that makes me feel horrible afterward. I really think by forcing myself to think about the choice to give in to temptation and binge using the explicit-zero reframing might actually help me! Of course, I'm instantly flooded with internal thoughts like ""yeah, but you'll be tempted all over again tomorrow and might make the wrong choice and then what's the point?!"". Obviously I'd have to be very conscious about ignoring those thoughts and considering the choice objectively. And presumably, it would get easier over time and with repetition... Well, what do you guys think? Obviously it's not the answer all by itself, but it seems to me that it could be a very powerful tool in my recovery toolbox!",_admin_moderator,"Sun,12/23/2018-4:00pm",Post Edited ,"Hi daisymay, We are glad to hear that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

357,.rose,12/15/2018,Amenorrhea question,"Hi, I'm new here and I just wanted to ask a question regarding amenorrhea.I lost my period a couple months ago and my doctor said I need to gain some weight to get it back. I'm not even sure that I have an eating disorder, just that I restricted calories enough to lose my period. I'm technically not in the healthy BMI range yet, but I'm really only a little bit underweight and I've been told that BMI is pretty inaccurate, anyway. I haven't even gained that much since my doctor told me to, but I am no longer anemic and my mom seems to think that I'm at a healthy weight. I still haven't gotten my period back though, and I have to admit that it makes me feel a little weird that she's telling me I can stop trying to gain now just based on how I look and the amount of time that's passed. Should I keep gaining until I get my period back? Or keep going until my BMI is technically healthy? Or should I listen to my mom and eat normally except for an extra snack? I might still naturally gain weight even if I'm not trying, just because I'm eating more than I used to, but it would probably be a really slow process.

358,amb28,12/20/2018,Relapse,"I have just joined the Neda forums, and I was disappointed to choose the ""working on recovery"" forum, rather than the ""maintaining recovery"" forum.  Since receiving treatment for the first time in 2011, I have been consistently motivated to stay in recovery.  I had a few slip ups over the years that lead to iop or day treatment, but those were mostly due to self harm/SI rather than ED behaviors.  Last spring was the first time I felt like I had a real ED relapse, and I was still able to treat it in day and iop.  During that relapse I felt so awful i swore ""never ever again"" would I do this to myself.  Already though, I am really struggling.  I have never relapsed so soon after treatment and I am feeling pretty disappointed in myself.  I feel like I just repeated the same mistakes I made in the spring, and I knew better.  I am struggling with restricting, and exercise urges though I haven't really been acting on those a whole lot.  I want to do better, I just feel so afraid to eat what I know I need to.  I feel stuck and like I need more support to get back on track.  I think iop might be helpful, but I absolutely can't take anymore time off of school, so it would have to fit into my schedule next semester.  Additionally I work with a client who has special needs in the evening and I feel so guilty to take more time off from that as well, because I feel that her family really needs me.

359,JATung,12/18/2018,Tracking binge or binge free days - helpful or harmful,"I have a binge eating issue and tonight was a bad one for me. I do this a few times a month and while it has bothered me for years only in the past month have I started acknowledging it as a possible ""disorder"". Using the word disorder and suggesting that I may have a borderline eating disorder seems to make my family and friends finally start taking my comments concerning this struggle seriously. It also makes me more motivated than ever to pursue healing and growth and to finally tackle this. So, to get to my question, do you think there is any benefit in tracking days where you have binged or not? The diagnosis for having a binge eating disorder states that it has to be repeated weekly for three months. I know I binge eat a couple times a month but its hard for me to say truly how often it is. I thought tracking it on a calendar might be good for my own awareness... but I'm hesitant thinking that I'd be inadvertently focusing on how often I binge, which is surely something I don't want to reinforce.",_admin_moderator,"Thu,12/20/2018-1:35pm",Hello and welcome to the,"Hello and welcome to the forums JATung!

361,Altina,12-04-18,Need some support to stop binge eating,"Hi guys,I'm a 22 year old male and I have a problem with binge eating, when I binge it is usually high calorie and X time(s) a week. It has been happening for three years now, with the only off period being for around 3 months, two years ago if I recall correctly. Recently I opened a business and the stress is impacting me and I am starting to binge more, each time I beat myself up and tell myself how to stop it and that it's emotional but inevitably I go back to binge eating. My weight and fitness is very important to me and as a result I am not overweight, but the binge eating is stopping me from reaching my goals and each time I binge I cannot bear to look at myself. I usually binge in private and I hide this from my family and close friends, I have only told a few people but they aren't here to support me. I am the kind of person to say that I should stop being a wuss and just to grow up, but I can't find a way to stop this cycle and this bad relationship with food using that approach.I wonder if there is anyone here who shared the same experience?

I know restricting would cause a binge-restrict cycle, that's happened before, but I am also afraid of eating normally, because once I start eating I don't seem to be able to stop. I lose control especially when I don't have school, because I'm home, there's more food around, and I live with my parents, who always cooks certain food. That's also the reason why Christmas holidays, which will be in two weeks terrify me, I'm afraid I will binge and gain a lot of weight.

Then PMS hit and even after MS I'm still CRAVING for this specific junk food. I feel guilty and Undisciplined to be craving this specific food. I even did well around Halloween time but this is like a wave hitting me and thrusting me into even deeper ocean waves just as i come up for air i am tossed and turned into a wave of all waves. Finally, until i am saved by a calming water and then no wave at ALL.  I swim in from the sandy beach which i finally being washed ashore to and only then do I feel clean and safe all over Again.... I don't ever plan to return to the ED inpatient which I had to stay at during the Summer. It was not realistic, and the boundaries just aren't there for me in my real environment here at home in my small suburban apartment in California, USA....I have a fridge, and a stove, and cabinets w/ food and when my cravings hit sometimes its just difficult to deal with.

Not alot of help in an eating disorder situation still.I am not going to go on much, yet 20 years is a long time with no let up.

372,mackie11,12-01-18,idk where this even belongs,"I don't even know where this belongs. I've never been diagnosed with an eating disorder and maybe I’m in recovery. Three years ago I decided to go on a diet for all the wrong reasons. I’ve struggled with body issues my entire life and this seemed like a way to drop weight in an instant. I lost a lot of weight- I looked great, people told me I looked great and it was awesome. I wasn’t eating the right foods and quickly became very sick; I had horrible digestive issues and cystic acne for the first time in my life.I didn’t want to stop because I didn’t want to gain the weight back. Finally, I realized I needed to fuel my body better. I went to a nutritionist and was told I was “sensitive” to many foods. It was basically a free pass to never eat. I felt emboldened by this assurance from a professional that I couldn’t eat a lot. I lost so much weight. I secretly loved it. I never told my friends that I loved it; I complained that I was too skinny and really trying to gain weight. I got a boyfriend and went on birth control and gained more weight. My body began to change and here I am. I weight less than I did before I went vegan but more than when I wasn’t eating. I have a horrible relationship with food and my body. I still don’t eat certain foods (more for fear of getting larger than for acne or digestive issues). I have never really told anyone this. My doctor asked me a year ago if I thought I had an eating disorder and I said no— I think about that a lot and wish we talked longer about it. I went home and told my sister and she laughed and goes, “I don’t think you have an eating disorder.” Now that I’ve gained weight and am seemingly better on the outside I don’t think anyone would even believe me if I asked for help. I just know I don't like my body-- I lift up my shirt and look at myself in the mirror over X times a day. I question everything I eat and feel really guilty about eating bad food.

373,ozzie,11/28/2018,a hopeful first step to stop binging,"Hi, everyone. I'm new here, and I think that it's time for me to confront what I've been ignoring for a long time. I started dieting in eighth grade because my Taekwondo instructor wanted me to lose weight. I was competing at a national level and very committed, so I did what he asked. At that time, I was a healthy weight at the time but a little on the chubbier side. I lost the weight but then I kept losing weight even after I had reached a weight that my instructor was happy with. When I got to high school, I kept restricting calories in an unhealthy way until everything seemed to fall apart half way through ninth grade. I had problems with my friends and school, and I felt so lonely. I began eating more and started feeling better. I kept slowly gaining weight every year and began binging. I felt so embarrassed that all of my friends could see that I was gaining weight and I was depressed. But I always found comfort in food and started binging more and more and I've finally reached the point where I'm ready to stop. I want to lose weight, but I'm more focused on just being healthy again. I've gotten really out of shape because I'm scared of going to the gym, but I want to get over that and start prioritizing my health. I don't know where to start, but I thought that this might be a helpful first step. I also wanted to thank everyone else for sharing.

375,jmakela,11/27/2018,over-exercising and calorie counting obsession,"Hi. I'm new to this forum and relatively new to acknowledging that I have an eating disorder. I called the hotline yesterday and found out about this forum. I am a compulsive exerciser and calorie counter. Right now my body fat percentage is very low but that is also because I am an ultra-marathoner. I don't really want to or intend to stop exercising or running. It makes me feel good. I am a recovering alcoholic and I also have bipolar disorder, and I'm a former smoker, so running seems to be a much healthier habit. The problem is that I can't eat without immediately feeling like I need to work off all those calories on the same day. Last night my parents made me dinner at their house and then I ran in place while talking to my dad so I could work off the calories. Dad said it makes most people anxious to see me bouncing around in place. I work 58 hours a week and also have other obligations, so often I'm running late at night or exercising very early in the morning. It's an obsession. The calorie counting is a real problem too. Right now I can tell you that by 3pm I will have eaten a certain amount of calories (because I know what's in my lunch) and then before job #2 I'll eat and track and then after job #2 it will be more of the same, which is way over my self imposed limit for the day so I'll have to go home and run in place. It doesn't make sense, because I'm underweight and my body fat is so low it's off the chart. I don't need to be working this hard to keep my weight low, but I can't help myself. It's an obsession and it gets in the way of ""normal"" life. Sorry, I know a lot of this sounds like venting and it's a little too much for one post.

She did mention that this is no guarantee, and that at day of admission when the pre-auth claim is submitted, my insurance could deny the claim. My biggest fear at this point is that I will be emotionally ready and also make arrangements in my life to go to a treatment program, and then be denied. Has this ever happened to anyone?

I'm new here. I've heard that it's more likely to achieve a goal if you share it with someone. So that's me sharing my story.
I've been suffering with several eating disorders for about 5 years now. Last year I've made a lot of progress. There was time that I used to binge eat every day. Thanks to my parents and my boyfriends support I learned to dismiss urges to binge. Or I thought so. I used to overeat once a week at that time but still, it was a great accomplishment for me.
But things changed few weeks ago. I moved out and changed my university. I don't know if it's because of stress connected to moving to another country or because of me and my boyfriend breaking up, but my binges came back. I'm hopeless now. I thought that this nightmare was over. Ofcourse there was some weight gain too. Right now I don't even see any motivation to try again to fight the urges.
I'm here because I remember I was much happier when I was binge free. Maybe someone else experienced relapse, maybe someone also is a BE eater. Please let me know. We can support each other.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,11/21/2018-4:31pm","Hi Steff, I am sorry that you","Hi Steff, I am sorry that you are feeling hopeless now.  Asking for support regarding eating disorder recovery is wonderful, but I'm also concerned for your safety and I wanted you to be safe.  Please contact the Suicide Hotline at 800-273-TALK if you are feeling suicidal. Please also consisder contacting NEDA for resources to aid your recovery!

379,Fixxxer_3,11/21/2018,Trouble with Solids/Reg Meals,"Hey all! I've been working with a online e-coach/nutritionist/dietician, as my time is available (I just took a new job and am moved to a hotel to live for 2-3 months, until relocating again!!) Needless to say, it's been a frenzy (but good for change and outlook!) Anyhow, I haven't had a chance to set up an e-appointment this week, and had a quick question. Not looking for expert/medical advice, but just your experiences. I’m EDNOS, and (luckily?) find eating dessert like foods for dinner easier on my tummy and higher-cal (all ""wins"" IMO, towards weight restoration chances.) Anyhow, I've found that this early on, I really cannot eat normal sized portions yet. In place of this, I'm using certain foods on top of the small amounts I can digest. Also, I plan to drink a supplement with each dinner too. Is this OK to do without feeling guilty for not being able to eat a full meal, yet? I put a lot of pressure on myself, and this feels like ""cheating"" to me (I've read things that say, ""suck it up, it's gonna hurt, gas-bloating, etc!!!"") But, to me, until I can tolerate this without throwing up (accidentally) or causing refeeding, as long as calories are high, it still counts, right? Also, is it OK to use something like Zantac at the ""larger"" meals everyday, if I feel I need it. If it helps make me want to eat, I'm not against it (always has in the past), but I don't wanna bind myself up or become tolerant to it. Any tips?

380,letmebefree,11/18/2018,Thought I was recovering but I was getting worse,"Hello, I am new here. I decided I wanted to get healthy and lose weight about 6 months ago, but I ended up developing a mild eating disorder when counting calories, restricting, and overexercising took control over me. I realized that I had an extremely unhealthy relationship with food three months ago but I still wanted to lose weight. About a month ago I decided that I had enough and I would stop tracking macros and start intuitive eating and take a step into recovery. However, there are certain times I cannot stop myself from eating, and I don't know if I should just keep listening to my body or if it is just mental hunger. I have certainly overeaten a couple of times but I wouldn't say I really went to the point of full-on bingeing to the point I'm so stuffed I can't move or that I ate food I didn't like. For me, it was just eating foods I like and perhaps overdoing it a little. However, recently I realized I started gaining some weight after those days I overeat, and sometimes my weight goes back to normal in a couple of days due to water retention, but overall I did gain a very small amount of weight. I know I shouldn't worry about it but to someone with an ED it is very triggering and I started purging this weekend. I have purged X times in the last X days and I never used to struggle with purging before. I have purged probably a total of X times in the last X months until this weekend. It is really scary to me and I feel like if I listen to my body too much I will end up bingeing and purging.

386,andwewilllive,11/15/2018,feeling like my silence invalidates my struggle,"whether it's a good or a bad thing, i pride myself on being a VERY strong willed individual. I've struggled with depression/anxiety, and and eating disorder for what most people would probably consider a long, long time, but i have never been diagnosed nor have i EVER opened up to my parents about it. my friends have been able to give me support with anxiety issues and depressive/suicidal ideations/self harm, however when it comes to my ed i haven't been able to open up about it. I've been struggling with disordered eating for probably about 2-3 years now that i think about it, but it used to be just skipping a few meals/ fasting for a while, however this summer it really came on full swing when i went to summer school alone for a month. I have been only eating a certain amount and lost weight. i thought the behaviours would stop once i came home but (obviously) no such thing happened. relatives noticed and commented about my weight loss but since my family has always been on the thin side so it was easy to write it off as ""just losing my baby fat"". My mother brought it up almost obsessively (i understand she comes from the best possible place but it was infuriating at times). now, i was never technically underweight, definitely on the lower side of the scale but still not underweight, however for the past 4 months i have felt like a shell of who i used to be. i was always angry, i felt like i was floating and couldnt focus on a single thing. somehow something inside me just cracked last week and (after some tears and a lot of thinking things through) i decided enough is enough and i would take things into my own hands. i've slowly started eating a certain amount of meals a day(sometimes i cant manage much but it's better than nothing), im very bloated a lot of the time and it's terrifying to look into the mirror but i keep trying to refocus my thoughts on how no amount of weight loss will give me back my happiness. it's hard, but what's even harder is this roadbump i've hit. i keep coming back to the feeling that i've just faked this whole ""eating disorder"". i mean after all no one's ever used the words anorexia or EDNOS or anything like that. i haven't shared any of my feelings and struggles with ANYONE i know. im aware that, again, it's the disorder trying to retake control, but i feel like i almost have to Prove to my parents and close friends that i've been suffering so much these past few YEARS, let alone these worst 4-5 months. i'm determined to get on the road to recovery, and yet the feeling that i dont Deserve to recover/i have nothing to recover from keeps creeping over me. and i really don't know what to do. do i gather up my courage and bring up these struggles with my parents even After i've decided to attempt to get better? it feels a bit redundant, like im just seeking attention. after all wanting recognition for your suffering seems stupid. an i just crazy?",_admin_moderator,"Fri,11/16/2018-2:14pm",Post Edited,"“Hi andwewilllive!  We are glad that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

387,NinjaSocks,11/15/2018,Is this an eating disorder?,"I hope it's ok to post this here, if not sorry everyone and mods please remove and accept my apologies. I really don't know where else to turn, except maybe my dr but I am just not ready for that yet.Ive always struggled with my weight. Being on the chubby side a bit. My mom would make fun and call me out for it, despite not being the same way herself. In my 20's I began counting calories and keeping a food diary, giving myself only a certain amount of calories a day allowance. I lost weight. Mostly everyone gave me positive feedback. And this just fuelled me, to hear things like ""you're so tiny"" and ""so skinny"" felt rewarding. Then I got married and had two babies. My weight shot up. Three years ago I almost bled to death from a peptic ulcer on my bathroom floor, while my husband and kids were out. If they hadn't come home when they did, I was told I would not have made it. This began a battle with anemia and low iron. I had monthly blood transfusions and iron infusions. I lost a massive amount of weight. Partially because I was sick, and didn't want to eat because it hurt my stomach so much. But it turned into me wanting to remain thin and underweight, at any cost. I calorie counted and exercised too much. I finally got to a point where my health improved but my eating barely did. I remained thin but not underweight per say.  I have social anxiety, to the point I sometimes don't want to leave my house. It feels like due to the face that I’ve gone through certain situations, I have zero control over anything. My body. My life.Thus began what I wonder isn't an eating disorder...my ""symptoms"" are as follows...(yes I know that only a professional can diagnose me, I am just looking for answers before I go that route, if I go that route). Symptoms:1. I am eating a certain amount of calories a day on purpose.  Sometimes I eat more when others express concern but not often, I blame my lack of eating due to the fact my health is heading south again, because of new ulcers.2. I have a lot of inner dread that when I do eat, I will gain weight from even one meal or snack. 3. I hate eating in front of people, I feel like they are judging me. I'm not exactly why I feel like that. But when I do eat, I almost always wait till I am alone to do so. 4. When I look in the mirror, I can see that I am too thin. But yet my head is constantly telling me that I am fat. That I still have like a certain amount of weight to lose. 5. I am constantly tired, weak, dizzy and easily out of breath. When I stand up from sitting or standing, heck even kneeling..I am so dizzy I have to brace myself for fear of fainting and inability to move. My entire body shakes, and everything spins. I'm cold all the time, even when others are complaining it's too warm. My cognitive function is slightly impaired. I forget things so easily. I struggle to recall words at times when I am talking. 6. I think about my weight and food constantly. It is taking over my life. I can barely take care of my kids, because I lack the energy to do so.7. My emotions are a mess. I am typically a happy person, who is hard to anger. But lately it's not like that. I'm snappy and short in patience. 8. I mostly try to hide my weight loss, with baggy tops and layers.Sorry this was so long. Thank you for reading.

388,iwanttolive,11-06-18,recoveryis possible,"Hi.  I usually post under maintaining recovery.  But tonight I am doing both.  I suffered many years, thirty-two or so, with various eating disorders in varying degrees.  I was hospitalized twenty seven times.  Some lasting a year, some six months, some two weeks.  I spent time in half way houses, day programs and am still in therapy.  I say all this to encourage you believe it or not!!!  I have been going through quite a trial with two of my sisters, one of whom I live with.  Since this summer I have been set free from my behaviors and addictions.  Self harm, overeating and binging.  I have been free from anorexia for about two years.  I never thought  this possible.   But during this time of great struggle, I have remained behavior free.  I have used what I have dubbed my recovery muscle.  I rely on my faith in Jesus, and the love of my friends and my parents.  I use skills I have learned.  I now know that full recovery is possible.  I do not know what tomorrow holds, but I trust that I will continue on as I am, facing the issues head on, talking about them with friends and my parents, and my therapist, and believe I will remain behavior free.  I now know that the misuse of food and exercise and self harm does bring a temporary relief, but the problems don't go away but are only compounded when using these maladaptive behaviors.  I share to give you hope that you too may one day be penning these very same words.  I never thought it possible, but...and you can fill in the blank.  You can share your story of recovery to others.

390,keeponfighting,11-04-18,In Too Deep.. ,"Hey y’all, first timer here and I just wanted to share my particular struggle in hopes that someone can relate and or has any advice.
A little bit of background:
I have been a raging bulimic for way too long. It started my sophomore year of college and was so severe that my roommates contacted my parents out of fear and concern. They showed up at the front door of my apartment within hours of the phone call and I was off to inpatient treatment.
Fast forward 42 days to family week and I received news from my treatment team that I still needed much more recovery and they recommended I stay AT LEAST another 6 months. Knowing deep down I needed to stay for twice as long, I figured I could manage and was ready to get back to my normal life.
Within a month I was back hand-in-hand with Ed, and I say with a heavy, broken heart that since then I have only gone two weeks without binging & purging.
For five solid years I have been lying to myself and everyone who cares about me. Not just denial or keeping it a secret, I mean straight up compulsive lying. I will look at my parents and my boyfriend dead in the face and tell them how difficult it was to overcome my condition, how I’m so grateful to be recovered, and even make comments out of the complete blue about what it was like when I struggled with my eating disorder.
I have been more worried about making sure no one knew and in the process I convinced myself that what I was saying was true.
Has anyone else gone to this extreme?
Anyway, I am ready to put this demon to rest, for good. It’s taken such a toll on me in every aspect of my life and I’m over it. I have all the tools from treatment and years of therapy so I know what to do... BUT, I am afriad I will only abstain for a few days and then go back to it just like I always do every single time. It’s like I know myself to well and I have failed so many times that I’m to the point of hopelessness.
I spent awhile reading through the last few pages of posts on here and noticed a lot of people saying they just “weren’t ready” or “maybe it isn’t your time” in regards to recovery and quite frankly that scares me the most. I have already lost 5 years of my beautiful life to this horrific disease and IT gets to decide when it’s done with me? What if I drop dead in the meantime?
I’m prepared to come clean to my parents about it and let them know I’m devoting myself to recovery again, but then part of me feels like I shouldn’t even bother because I’ll fail them too and just repeat the fake recovery lying cycle to avoid doing so. I’m DEFINITELY not telling my boyfriend. Things are way too good with him and I’m not about to put that at risk. Is that bad? We aren’t married or anything and he wouldn’t be any help anyway. He doesn’t understand and I don’t have the energy to try and get him to. Any thoughts on that?
One more thing: can anyone who has some recovery time PLEASE tell me you get your physical appearance back? I know the face bloating goes away but my skin is all dried out and my hair is too thin and I just look like a different person overall. Any tips to help speed the physical recovery process up?

I guess that was a delusion I led myself to believe.  I feel horrible for letting my negative Nancy tell me that.  -.-  My fiance has even noticed, within the last 4 years I'd go through various crash diets in order to try to lose weight. But the issue I guess I have is...  When I'm stuck in that routine, counting calories, or doing x,y, or z to try to lose weight, seeing those numbers dropping, seeing them drop slowly was never fast enough, I wanted it gone right then and there.  I have this issue where I want something down NOW.  Though seeing the numbers dropping is horribly intoxicating.  The only thing that clued me into the possibility that I had an eating disorder was starting my 'latest diet'...  And spilling it all over the place, only for my head to tell me ""Hey it's okay, it's not like you're eating food anyways, why would you need anything caloric of an intake.  We really should just not eat anything.""That made me realize, because I knew that wasn't myself speaking...  I had gone into one of my obsessive compulsive get slim fast diets again, and I finally recognized... maybe I'm not doing something healthy for myself by doing this if the voice I had trusted for so long is telling me this.  I just... I don't know what to do now. x.x  I'm hungry but the appetite is not there.  I mean, I do plan to see my therapist obviously.

393,abbeylane64,11-10-18,I’m confused as to if I have an eating disorder. ,"Back in high school I struggled with Anorexia - never diagnosed - but I rarely ate more than X calories, worked out constantly, etc. one day I decided to just do better so I did, but ever since I’ve struggled to keep weight on.
I worry about it constantly. I’m constantly wanting to gain weight but I’m not able to.
I’ve thought over the past year that maybe this has something to do with my past? Maybe I’m not better even though I do feel as if I am.
I decided to seek out and write on this forum because my weight dropped and it's very concerning to me. I’ve been tested for everything under the moon and come out healthy. But any time my doctors bring up my eating habits, if I’m hungry, etc I feel as though I probably lie because I’m uncomfortable with the truth. My only thing is I stay nauseous.
I don’t know if this is an eating disorder? Or it’s even worth bringing up to anyone.

394,Laurie24,11-11-18,Atypical Anorexia,"Hi y’all,
I started experiencing weight loss about 3 years ago after working almost constantly for a couple days and unintentionally not eating much. After that my appetite plummeted. I wasn’t hungry whatsoever, eating or attempting to do so made me want to gag, and I just in general had completely lost my appetite. I gained the weight back though, no big deal. This has happened about 3 other times in the past 3 years. Each time I’ve gained the weight back. Except for this go around- I’m currently underweight, as I was the other 3 times. It’s hard for me to get across to my doctors and parents that I’m not doing this on purpose. I haven’t restricted my food ever, I’m not secretive about my eating, I don’t even own a scale. I WANT to gain the weight back so, so bad. I just don’t know where to start this time. It’s definitely worse, I’m the thinnest I’ve ever been with it affecting my hair and eyelashes enough to where I cut 7 inches off so it would look fuller. I’ve been to my primary doctor, they ran blood work and it was normal. I’ve had them do blood work with each weight loss and it’s always been normal. I recently started seeing a therapist for the first time and she told me she wasn’t certain it was my mental health causing it either. So I’m sort of at a loss right now.

Now that I've decided to forego it I can't help but to pass out after eating something that isn't within that diet.  It's annoying me because I know it would be healthy to be eating the stuff outside of said diet.  It's also frustrating me that it feels like my stomach is always empty even after eating it feels like it's empty.  I know it's likely because after I eat, I fill 'full', but then not too long after I feel hungry again and I'm just afraid with that constant hunger feeling, that I'm going to be binge eating and I don't want to do that either.  My binge eating isn't much either I guess?

I do understand that going to my doctor would be 100% the right thing to do, but as this is something so foreign to me and something that I am so unfamiliar with, I wanted to come here first.

397,pesewla,10/14/2018,Anorexia to Binge Eating. Please help me.,"Hi guys, this is my first post so I apologize if I don't phrase my issues correctly.
I'm about a year out of professional treatment for anorexia and I still talk with a nutritionist, therapist, and doctor to make sure I don't fall into a dangerous weight zone that threatens my health. I still have weeks where I struggle severely with undereating, enjoying the sensation of undereating, and losing progress in this recovery. A more pressing issue, however, is the bingeing that began a few months ago. No one seems to be concerned about this bingeing, especially since I've been maintaining a low-healthy BMI range even after it began (because of the restriction that follows...). I have good and bad months - some months I will only binge a few times a month, but other months I will binge, feel so guilty and fat that I will restrict, binge again, and the cycle repeats the whole month. I'm so aware that this is a disordered way of eating.It's so difficult to understand my feelings to anyone. I cry to my mom the whole night after a binge, and she can't understand why I can't stop eating and come for help. My therapist tells me strategies to distract myself when I feel like bingeing, but NOTHING is a substitute for food when I feel the great urge to binge. I'm still so afraid of gaining weight and the binge feels like a monster compelling me to eat everything in sight and I can't possibly stop when it calls to me. I don't know what to do, and sometimes I feel so bad after a binge that I'm close to committing suicide so I can die before I gain a ton of weight. The urges only happen at night, but when they happen either I sit clenching my teeth for hours upon end (trying so hard not to eat more) and then inevitably binge the next night, or simply binge out of resignation, eating many calories. Then I don't eat for a few days I seriously don't know what to do; I don't know why I have the self-control to starve during the day but completely lose any semblance of control when night strikes. I've tried to identify what triggers a binge, but so many things trigger a binge that I'd have to live in a bubble to avoid them. It makes no sense, and no one seems to care as long as I'm skinny but healthy. I hate myself even more than I did when I was struggling with anorexia. Please help me. I'd do anything.

400,s.boewer,10/26/2018,Recovery is possible,"I just want to say to everyone that recovery is possible. I've been eating a healthy meal plan for a few months and I am experiencing a decline in ED thoughts and learning to have self acceptance for the first time in 34 years. There's a lot of hard work in therapy but it is paying off quickly. I didn't think I would ever have a time in my life that was free of the obsessive thoughts of food and weight but now I am not considering those things at all. My fear of excessive weight gain is gone and I like my body when I look in the mirror, flaws and all! The key for me was learning the power of acceptance in every area of my life. I let go of my need to control my external environment and focus on the internal environment. The dysfunctional behaviors are a distant memory at this point and I am peeling away the layers of years of self doubt without being overwhelmed by the process. If I can obtain recovery so quickly just by accepting myself and trusting God to handle the details then anyone can experience this. It doesn't have to take years of hard work and really is as simple as just accepting yourself for what you are. I am working on accepting that I am a 48 year old woman and not a teenager anymore which has been the hardest part but it's nice to feel like a mature and competent grown up for once. I am working in the drug and alcohol treatment environment and finding I can work with people and make a difference without feeling like a phony because now I am living the tools I talk about with clients.

Also, I’m a recovered heroine addict, 22 years. If I can beat that I can beat a box of cereal at 3am. Oddly enough the same neurotransmitter that is pleased by opiates is pleased by food.

But now that I know that I don't know where to go from there. I obviously want to have a healthy relationship with food, But I don't. And I haven't had one in a very long time. How to do build a relationship that I haven't had nearly all of my teenage years?In high school I was a part of a professional Ballet company, and I think that is where my problems started. In high school I started to notice that I was 'fat' and shorter than the other girls, so I stopped eating and no one said anything to me. No one tried to stop me. For the majority of high school I tried to eat less than my recommended number of calories, and some days I wouldn't eat at all, or would only eat when I was forced to because of social pressures. I was under weight. I have tried so hard in the past year to build up the confidence to have a healthy relationship with my body and with food, but recently I feel out of control, and lost again. I just started college, so i'm trying to figure out this whole living on my own thing at the same time as this. I seem to have regained my terror of gaining weight, though I live without a scale because withone I would be a mess. But all the same I know I have gained weight, a signifigant amount and while I know that I shouldn't be as low as I was before, I'm also not building great habbits. I have become obsessive about going to the gym. I wake up at 5:30 every morning regardless of how I feel inorder to exercise and run a number of miles and do some sort of strechings. Then again in the evening. I'm spending anywhere from 3-5 hours at the gym a day. But then I come back to my room, and I binge eat. I don't know how much I should be eating, but I get started eating because I'm ravinous, and I can't stop. And all I can see when I look in the mirror is my weight looking back at me. It feels like all the work I put in to gain a positive self image over the past year is gone.Please offer some help, or words of advice. I Just want, for once, my life to not revolve around calories. I want to be able to go out to eat with my friends, and nto freak out if they list the calories, and be unable to eat. I have never been diagnosed because I never speak up, and no one else around me seems to notice a problem. Please help me to get back on track.

404,Smrekca13,10/26/2018,Fixed contract and bulimia is back,"Hi everybody :)I have so much questions and no answers.
Bulimia. My best friends for the past 9 years. Started overweight with X, was sent to overweight kids camp, dropped X, went to anorexia onwards to bulimia. But for the past 2 years I was bulimia free.Now it's all back.While being bulimia free, I was maintaining weight, while eating a lot of one food type and doing no excercise.3 -4 months ago I signed a fixed contract, I've cut on back on X, started running regularly for half-marathon preparation, because I wanted to loose weight and be more fit for the stressful job.
And bulimia returned in all it's glory. What messed me up even more, is that I gained weight now, just like that.And I am throwing up, the heavy binge phase isn't even in it's full swing. This bloody number. My reflection in the mirror. Pictures of me. It is eating me alive. In the morning when I dress up I gag on my own reflection in the mirror. In the gym I wear loose T-Shirts. I hate my belly, I hate my arms I run until I'm dizzy, vomit until I feel ok and weight is still going up. I don't get my body. I am afraid of eating X, what if my body will store even more fat? What should I eat? How to loose the gained weight? I also turned 24, perhaps my metabolism just hates me right now. Has 9y of bulimia left so much damage, that my body will now store all food in the second it feels calorie deficit? Looking forward for your advise :)Hugs,

407,loafmom77,10/21/2018,Seven years,"Hi, everyone. This is my first time posting to an ED forum. I have struggled with my eating disorder since I was fourteen (I'm twenty-one now and a senior in college) and I am finally seeing a counselor about it. This whole time I thought I had bouts of recovery and bouts of relapse but I realized a month ago that I've just continuously had different amounts of restriction. That this eating disorder has been constant and just hovering over my shoulder. I have general anxiety disorder that I know for sure stems from the ED; I get anxious over little things, but mostly regarding food and what I eat and when I eat and how often I eat. There are times when I only eat an apple or granola bar during the day but other days when I eat at least two meals. As of lately, though, I tend to get nauseated whenever I eat-- has anyone else experienced this? I've had a few ""good"" days in the last two weeks where I made sure to eat three times a day and for the last two days or so my stomach hurts, I get acid reflux, or I feel incredibly sick when I eat... even if it's just something small or a cup of coffee. Is this normal? I'm assuming that my body is just readjusting to having food in my stomach. Sometimes (oh, who am I kidding, most times) when I eat, I'm very aware of how full my stomach feels, even if it's just a sandwich-- when, in the past, I would be able to eat a meal and still want something else. I went to a wedding last night and they didn't have any vegetarian-friendly foods so I only ate a little when I got home, and then hours later I felt like I wanted to be sick because I ate something. I have an intense fear of vomit and I wanted to keep the food in because it tasted good and I enjoyed eating it but my body was like.... almost attacking itself. I have my second appointment with my counselor this Wednesday and I'm going to mention this to him and ask what he thinks but, in the meantime, I'm very confused. I'm at this point where I want to eat and I want to enjoy eating because I'm so tired of my ED and my anxiety becoming almost unmanageable and uncontrollable. I want help. I want to be better and to not restrict anymore. I really do-- it's just when I feel like this when I eat it makes me want to never eat again and I feel so confused. Does anyone have any advice? Thanks in advance.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,10/23/2018-10:30pm",Hey loafmom77Your post has,Hey loafmom77Your post has been slightly edited to more adhere to the community guidelines.Thank you for your understanding.https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/forums/community-guidelines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
408,crazyplantlady,10/16/2018,Recovery dilemma,"Hi everyone. I just joined the forum today. I was diagnosed with anorexia last Thursday but I’ve been sick for just over a year now. Though I realized several months ago that I have a problem, it took months to even consider getting help, because I was convinced I had it under control and could do it on my own (which is obviously not the case). In late August I took the first active step towards recovery and spoke to some people from a local eating disorder foundation. After that I saw my doctor who did some tests and then referred me to a treatment center. During all this I haven’t changed my disordered behaviors, because I was waiting for a professional who could tell me what to do. I went to the treatment center and talked to a psychiatrist who presented me with to treatment offers (I am fortunate enough to have access to free public treatment where I live). The first involves group sessions and committing to maintaining your weight. The second is similar but you have to gain a certain amount of weight each week, which scares me so much. I have been mainting my current weight for months now, so I feel as if the first option will just leave me stuck where I am now. And I’m just way too scared to do the second one. To complicate things further, I’m currently taking some classes where no absence is tolerated and they are on the same day and time as the group sessions, so I can’t go into treatment before the classes finish in December. At the same time I really want to start taking this education that starts in January, which will mean I have to move across the country and can’t possibly receive treatment at the treatment center I’ve already visited. My mother says she will pay for my treatment if I prefer to find a psychiatrist elsewhere, but I just can’t bring myself to ask her to spend that kind of money, when I’m being offered treatment for free. But at the same time I don’t trust that treatment center to do what’s best for me. One of the reasons is that they gave me a pamphlet from 1996 to take home...  like there hasn’t been any progress in ed treatment since then! I left feeling very disappointed and discouraged. For the last two days I’ve been trying to gain weight on my own because I finally realized what I’m doing to my body and freaked out a bit. I just don’t know what to do. I feel pretty ungrateful because I know that free treatment is such a privilege and not an option for most of you, but at the same time I just can’t see how it could work. Sorry for the long post, I hope it makes sense.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,10/24/2018-12:51am",Edit,Your post has been edited                                                       https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/forums/community-guidelines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
409,alexrecovers,10/24/2018,Should I be eating this much?,"Hello everyone. I am actively trying to recover from anorexa/restrictive eating. Currently, I am experiencing extreme hunger. I have the urge to binge on things like cheese and bagels and am feeling extremely stressed by it. I know this is normal in recovery because we are coming from a period of starvation.
The problem is, I have a difficult time justifying giving in to this. While I experienced many of the signs of starvation (lack of period, thyroid imbalance, adrenal fatigue), I never got down to an “underweight” weight. Should I be eating close to XX calories everyday when I do not necessarily need to gain weight?

410,kayla233,10/22/2018,Feeling like I can't see myself as I truly am (physically!) ,"I've been attempting recovery from Anorexia for a couple of months now through therapy and the help of a nutritionist. Although I'm technically not underweight, and my BMI doesn't fall under the ""proper diagnosis number"" that constitutes an Anorexia diagnosis, my therapist still checks off ""Anorexia Nervosa (Restricting type)"" on my receipts. This brings me to my main topic/question. I have never been underweight in my life, and for most of my adult life, ages 18 to present day 22. When I stepped on the scale at the doctor, I was shocked to see my weight had dropped significantly. I get blind weighed, so I don't know how much I weigh now (not that it matters!!! besides for health reasons, of course.) but my parents and close relatives are constantly commenting on how I'm ""just skin and bones"" and ""too thin.""(My ED tends to tell me they are just saying that because they want to sabotage me, make me fat, or are simply just lying so I will stop being sick and hurting my body). For obvious health reasons such as hypothyroidism and loss of menstruation, I recognize what I've done to my body, I just can't recognize it when it comes to looking in the mirror. Big goals in my recovery have been to regain my menses and heal my body from the inside out, but my ED tells me that if my BMI is ""normal"" there is nothing wrong with me and gaining weight would be pointless. How can I get the proper motivation to eat more and have a healthy relationship with food if I feel like I technically don't *need* to be restoring weight when science tells me there's nothing to restore. How can I know how much to eat to heal my body, and how can I quiet the ED voice when I simply can't see what the people around me see (or claim to see) when I look in the mirror.",_admin_moderator,"Tue,10/23/2018-10:54pm",Hello and welcome Kayla.Your,Hello and welcome Kayla.Your post has been slightly edited to remove the specific weight related numbers.

412,himang,10/17/2018,Struggling with the two sides of me,"I’ve been struggling with ednos for almost two years and last week I made the resolution to give up on my two most unhealthy habits, purging and chewing on my food and spitting it right back. However, I still feel the urge to binge and I’m eating way more than I should (maybe around XX cals but that’s still way more than I can eat without feeling anxious, I plan my daily meals to be around XX cals but I always screw up and eat more). These months I’ve been losing and maintaining my weight thanks to purging and spitting, but now I feel helpless, like if I was condemned to gain weight again and keep eating uncontrollably until my brain “clicks” again and my anxiety makes me go back to restriction... and live like that forever, alternating between those two... persons? That’s how it feels like for me, like there’s the normal me, the me with binge-bulimic tendencies and the anorexic me, and the normal me just watchs how the other two fight each other two death without being able to do anything. I do feel like I’m three different people and sometimes I can feel that I’m “transitioning” from one to another, and it makes me even more anxious than realizing it once it’s already over. Right now I can feel how the binging me is coming back and I can’t stop her, I regain “consciousness” once I’ve already eaten and I feel like if she kind of kidnapps me in punctual moments to then leave alone again with an amount of guilty and anxiousness I’m unable to deal with. I do want to get better and eat a more balanced diet but whenever I stop restricting I go back to binging and I’m so scared because it’s not like if I had a weak will but rather I’m just a prisoner of someone else who takes my body and does things I don’t want to do. I don’t know if other people with ednos feel this way because I had never met anyone like me but when talking about this with my friends I feel actually crazy... I just want to know if it’s “normal” to have this feeling of being multiple people and how to deal with it. Like, is there any way to control it?

414,PhoenixGirl,09/27/2018,Is this normal in recovery???,"Hello, there.I've been working towards recovery for a little over a week or two, but I'm unable to see doctors or receive outside help for a few reasons that I'm not going to get into right now. Anyways, I finally hit a point where things had to change and I've done a lot of research to try to make sure that I recover in the best way that I can. It's been challenging, but my mental health feels far better than the first few days of working towards recovery. My mind is clearer and my overall mood has improved (aside from the occasional anxiety attacks). Researching everything along the way that I experience helps me feel in control in a situation that would often make feel that I was spiraling out of control. But there are a few things I'm experiencing and they worry me some. I want to see if they are normal/anyone else has experienced this.Of course, I experienced some nausea, headaches, extreme hunger, rapid weight gain, night sweats, and constant hot flashes after having felt only cold for months. All of this I've read about, so they don't worry me as much. But another thing that I'm experiencing is pain. My body is tender to the touch and feels like it's been hit with a blunt object. This is mostly around my ribs, chest, and abdomen area but I feel some around most of my body. I don't know if this would be edema?

So am very busy these days. The days I'm not at work are the days I find myself binging on junk foods. I am disciplined Usually. Somehow a switch is turned on when I have free time or downtime. I feel exhausted lately and can't even focus on reading a short book. I am on an extended sub assignment currently and my retail job is only now realizing that my time is limited by job #1. So I am now working retail from about 5-9 and weekends 11-close...I need to sleep in a tad on weekends as this is my Only Down Time for me for the entire week...Saw the dentist and the cusp of a back molar is missing. Think they could do a cosmetic coating of an overlay cusp.W/ all the new light cured putty dental materials and re-create the missing cusp. 1 Office says i need the 1st root canal then a crown. I want to avoid a crown if possible. I wish I knew an older experienced dentist who could just put me under and do the darn RC as well as anything else necessary. They won't clean my teeth now until they do a deep clean and then would remain on a hygiene schedule every 3 months or so to keep my gums and deep pockets from collecting plaque and possibly avoid gumline cavities. So am feeling extra anxious and can't chew well on my dominant chewing side currently either. Well, gotta go to my job #2. I work tonight...Had a small lunch but my eating schedule is way off so can't eat now until around 6PM-ish. Not sure what will even stuff into my orifice at work. I feel anxious just thinking of eating a meal and re-gaining more weight. I'm doing ok, so far? Oh, P.S., I have temporarily lost my med insurance until i sign up again after Oct 15th for medicare-cal...Good thing I'm usually as healthy as a darn horse. I just try and be extra careful until covered then perhaps I'll have an emergency just to see if my ER still cares for me. I'll let them figure out what my problem is. Anxiety is up, and feeling terrified over my gaining weight w/o exercising.

417,Claim_staker,10-05-18,Coming to terms ,"Coming to terms with the fact that I have binge eating disorder. Started working out and changed my diet about 5 years ago. Lost X pounds. I spent my entire life eating endless amounts of junk food and fast food and then did a complete 180. I would always pick X day(s) out of the week though to have a binge day and the day after I would just feel completely ashamed. I would avoid people, wear extremely baggy clothes, and eat pretty much no X the next day. Lately these episodes have been more frequent. Just had my X binge this week alone and feel so embarrassed and physically sick. I'm defintely an emotional eater but haven't really been feeling down lately. Can't really pin point what's been causing me to binge eat. Maybe out of loneliness.

418,jackiekales,10-01-18,terrified to begin recovery,"Hi there!! Buckle up, because this is going to be a long one. I really need some help on what to do here- I feel so lost. I’m 19, in my second year at a new college, and I’ve been struggling with eating disorders since I was 12. I’ve never been formally diagnosed, and I don’t even think my family knows, because I have always been “the small girl”. I’ve been underweight my entire life, and have been weighing in at the same weight. I’ve managed to maintain my underweight status all these years so everyone, including my family, just thinks that’s the way I’m supposed to be, naturally (which maybe it is? I wouldn’t know. I haven’t allowed myself to gain in years). I’ve been restricting my calories every single day for years and I can’t eat without feeling guilt so bad it’s physically nauseating. I’ve cut almost every major food group out of my diet. I’m dizzy all of the time and while I go on-and-off between physically counting my calories with an app, it’s rare for me to ever go over or even near a certain amount of calories a day. I eat enough to maintain my weight. I don’t go on huge binges, but when I feel full I do occasionally turn to purging. I’m so, so tired all of the time and my mental health is at an all-time low- I feel like at this point, I’m never going to recover. I’ve never been “sick enough” to send up red flags, because being this small has always been my norm. The thought of gaining even just a few pounds gives me an immense paralyzing fear. But I can’t go on like this anymore, I don’t want to have had all of my teenage years stolen by this disease. I don’t want to live like this for the rest of my life.The problem is, I’m terrified of telling my parents. A big thing that feeds into my anorexia is guilt, and I can’t stand the thought of putting this disaster onto my parents. My only other sibling, my older sister by a few years, has been going through issues with her sexuality for at least almost 10 years, has gone through therapy in order to come to terms with it, etc, and I know my parents blame themselves for any problems she’s gone through. My mom is a little mentally unstable as well, and I know she the most would feel the most burn if she ever found out about my eating disorder, because we’re close and it’s been going on for so long without her even noticing. But I can’t stand to have my parents blame themselves for my problems too, even though they are so loving and supportive and would absolutely help me get the help I need.While I think we could afford treatment for me, I’ve always felt really terrible guilt whenever it comes to my parents spending money on me- I’m not sure why, though. I don’t want to put my parents through the emotional turmoil of knowing what I’ve been going through and somehow think that they’re bad parents because now BOTH of their kids are not mentally well. I’m somewhat of the golden childen, and I don’t think I’d be able to handle letting them in on my hardships and the stress it would cause them. It would crush me and it terrifies me even just thinking about telling them.It’s worth mentioning that I switched schools after sixth grade due to some minor bullying, which probably led to my eating disorder and self-harm habits (that I haven’t used in over three years) just a year later. I also transferred colleges this past year, after my freshman year, due to some extreme mental problems that resulted from the school I was attending, stress, etc. My anorexia got so much worse while I was at that school, and it was there I finally cracked and begged my parents to get me to counseling (I said it was for my concentration issues and insomnia/exhaustion, which is true, but definitely not the biggest issue here). I attended exactly one counseling session at my school before I became too busy to, and both my parents and I dropped it eventually. This was the first time I’ve ever let my parents in on my struggles, and it was terrifying.I feel so lonely and I don’t know what to do. I crave recovery so bad but I’m terrified of changing my ways, the ways I’ve had for over six years. Every time I’ve tried to recover myself, I just fall back even harder. I know I can’t do this alone, but I don’t want to put my baggage on to anyone else in absolutely any way. Please, please, please give me some advice.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,10/03/2018-12:30pm","Hi jackiekales, welcome and","Hi jackiekales, welcome and we are glad that you are finding support here on the NEDA forums.

Earlier this year I went on a diet and managed to lose like some weight. I was so proud. But even at that moment I binge ate often. It's gotten worse now. I binge eat more often than I'd like to admit, to the point my tummy hurts constantly. I don't know who I am anymore. I'm not as cheerful as I used to be. I don't wanna leave my bed. I just eat and then look in the mirror and feel like I'm disgusting. However, I've never been able to actually starve or throw up and that makes me feel like a failure. I feel like I'm a gross fat girl who can't do anything right. I really wanna stop having these thoughts, but I just don't know how. I wish I could just cope better with everything that's going on.

424,MusicxArt,09/22/2018,Exhausted,"So I don't really know how to start this because I've kept all of this fear in for years at this point. I guess a good point to start would be when it kinda started?
When I was eleven years old, I began to notice that I was always bigger than other girls. Not fat in the slightest, but just bigger arms, bigger thighs, etc. I hated it, because people would always point it out in my school, but then my extended family would always say I needed to eat more and that I was too skinny. This ended up making me extremely self conscious about my weight, and I started to distrust how I looked to myself. I look back and see photos and wish I looked that way again, but right now even the thought of food terrifies me.
People always say you can't out work a bad diet, but I have no idea what a good diet even looks like. I've been half starving, half eating for years at this point and so I feel like all the food I do have access to is awful and I don't want to touch it. It stresses me out, and as someone who just graduated college, I don't really have much control over the foods we get since money is tight.
I just feel helpless. I don't want to sleep anymore because I can never get more than a few hours of crappy sleep. I don't want to eat anymore because the kitchen has become a hell for me. I don't want to be awake anymore because when I am awake, I worry about how awful my health probably is and get worried that my heart is going to give out on me.

I am looking for community and comfort. I can get this from my friends yes, but they do not experience what I am facing so they do not understand.
A little about me, I am a third year BSW (social work) student and have struggled, off and on varying in severeness since I was in grade six. I am 21 now. So for most of my life I have always had this on my mind and controlling my life.Recently, my feelings, emotions, and behaviors towards food have resurfaced. And resurfaced with intensity. All summer I lived alone and was very happy, ate local, clean or organic, really cared for myself. But once my roommate moved in and school began, I have noticed changes in myself. My binge eating and purging has resurfaced, and my restricting of food as also came back full force.See, when I was in grade 6 my teacher called my mom saying I was not eating my school lunches, her rational for this was because ""I wanted attention from boys, I would offer them my food, and thus give me attention"" Things could have been addressed then and there for what it really was. Rather my mom got upset and did do some research and took me to see some specialist but nothing followed up after that. Throw in some toxic friendships and teenage years... I was a mess.So needless to say, I am still here and still struggling. I did make a doctors apt. about not being able to loss weight at this apt. I did bring up my past about eating issues HOPING THIS WAS MY SAVING GRACE MY CALL FOR HELP. They did not address it.Here I am 21, social work student, leaning how to help others when I cant and unwilling to help myself. Here I am, working towards recovery 10 years in the making.Thank you to any one who took the time to read this.

How do I go about eating?","Hi!I struggled with a restrictive eating disorder, but never dropped significantly below an unhealthy BMI. I was inpatient at a residential facility where I was eating at a pretty significant surplus, but only gained a small amount in the first 3 weeks. I've been struggling again with binge eating since July (I was in residential in August), which is where my eating disorder started, but I've noticed that I'm not really gaining at the rate that I would expect. Basically, I immediately feel exhausted once I begin eating around maintenance, and get hot flashes, night sweats, and feel almost back to normal the day after binges. Is it still possible to enter a hypermetabolic state at a healthy weight? As stressful as binges are, I can't help but notice how much more energy and how, well, not miserable I feel after eating significantly more than what I thought was maintenance, and I wonder if eating at what I think is maintenance is leading to more binges because it's significantly below my RMR.

430,Eva123,09-07-18,How can I fight to recover when it hurts so much,"I want to be better, but I've tried to be better and it just made me feel worse.
Eating makes me suicidal so how am I meant to consolidate that with recovery?
How am I meant to try to recover again when my mood completely dropped, I started getting suicidal again, hating myself more then ever when I reached a healthy weight.
And when youre eating and looking healthy as much as everyone reassures you they know its a mental illness and that they know youre struggling, suddenly they dont care as much, suddenly its okay for you to be miserable because you arent physically at risk anymore. People say its a mental illness but still treat it as a physical illness so I'm left with the anxiety and depression which caused my eating disorder because no one cares anymore. No one cares to leave you in pain if you look okay on the outside.
So yes, I know recovery leaves hard feelings to deal with but it also makes me more unsafe and NO ONE CARES because my weight looks normal.
I feel so alone and everyones left me alone because I look okay. Every fear I had about becoming healthy came true. I am struggling again but its not as extreme as last time so I'm being left alone. I'm in pain and I can't recover because it ruins my life and makes everything worse and its not like i didnt try, i went all the way for complete remission and i achieved it until all the promises of helping me mentally just went away. They promised not to just make me gain weight, they promised to help with the reasons why I got an eating disorder but then they just didnt.
I don't want to suffer, I don't want to restrict and binge and over exercise. I don't want to be scared of calories, of certain foods, of eating out. I want to be free of this. I don't want to feel guilt or to hate myself and my body. I want to be strong and healthy and happy, but I just dont know how. I don't know how to do that when eating makes me so depressed and suicidal and no one cares because I don't look ill anymore.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,09/12/2018-12:20pm",Welcome to the forums! ,"Hello Eva123, welcome to the forums and we are glad you found a place to share your story and get help.

431,mariaisjesus,09-01-18,heartbreak and eating,"hey.. I´m shivering. I´ve been eating like crazy since I decided to get up from bed. The first half of my day consisted of crying hysterically, having panick attacks, and finding it hard to not hurt myself. Guess who got back to her old habits of letting food controll her emotions? Today was one of those days when u start your day wanting to fast, but later in the day in the life of your sad sad reality, you find urself making food in the kitchen while eating dinner from 2 days ago that for some reason is still in the fridge.. I myself have every intention of not overdoing it and actually stopping, but it´s almost like something takes over and tbh, I knew this was gonna happen to me already yesterday evening. I just get a different kind of hunger in the pit of my stomach after not eating for a while... I KNOW whats gonna happen.
now.
let´s talk about the title. Yeah, I´m legitemately devastated and it´s a secondhand hurt kind of devastated. He was my whole life for the last year of my life, my entire future had his footprints all over it. I was so blindly in love with him, that now I´m sitting here alone and ignored. I pushed away everyone that told me he wasn´t good for me, bacause he made me happy. How come I never realized he also hurt me just as frequently as he made my heart flutter? I think about the way I sat in the shower this morning, and cried for two hours straight listening to our song. A song I will never hear sung from him again, I will never be able to hold his face between my hands and kiss him, I will never again be able to look over at him when he says something stupid and just roll my eyes while smiling like crazy.
It really took everything in me to let him go, and I asked him straight forward to not contact me and he hasn´t. The feelings of desperate need for validation, love and attention are hitting me, resolving in food.Food is an issue for me and has always been, I was really overweight as a child and have been bullied about my weight for as long as I can remember.

New to forum. I was anorexic fouryears ago, regained a healthy weight by the end of 2015. Predominantly binge eating and throwing up. Steadily maintaining weight, manual labour, but am still acting on behaviors up about once a day, and the longest period so far that I've stayed clean since 2014 is four days. 30 year old female Family are not aware of problem.Two big concerns: I run a café in my home district, and whilst my habit DOESN'T go anywhere near my business physically ( although it does trigger) the confidential services here are not very confidential and cannot risk having it becoming known that the cafe is run by a bulimic.Second concern is that I've just had a minor operation and been prescribed medication, and whilst this is an excellent opportunity to try and defeat my problem I'm worried at the possible side effects of those ED behaviors whilst on the meds.Sorry if this is an inappropriate post, I'm just worried.

I've never been diagnosed with an ED but I lived with undiagnosed milk allergy for 5 years that destroyed my want to eat. I'ts been 3 years since my diagnosis and I'm finally in a place where I make all my own food and I realized I have a problem. My partner has to convince me to eat, and I dread it and avoid it. I have done a lot of work with my therapist to lower my anxiety about food and eating but I still find myself taking fast days or weeks. I have another friend with a food allergy, and he's a great support but he barely eats enough as well and I need to find things to help me get better. A lot of my friends  dismiss me when  i worry I've  developed  ED or at  least disorder eating on the basis that people ED have real problems and I'm over thinking it. I've lost a lot of weight in the past year, I feel ill a lot, and I feel like I'm constantly battling myself to eat. Even when I can convince myself to eat til I'm full, I feel sick for an entire day. Whether or not I have and ED, I need to find things that can help me.I've read a bunch of posts on this forum, and it makes me feel less alone at least. I'm looking for things on how does it feel to increase your food intact and how to healthily fo that. How do you get through the discomfort and fullness? What do you tell yourself to think?

436,wanz44,08/28/2018,Looking for tips from overcoming my weight obsession,"Not sure If I can be classified as anorexic but I know I have an obsession with wanting to stay thin/skinny.I’m a 64-year-old male. Just looking for some tips on getting away from my way of thinking of being very thin; It started when I quit smoking 11 years ago and didn't want to gain weight. I wasn't truly overweight. Just a small gut. My fear of putting on weight escalated to where I lost a significant amount of weight and it isn't so much of the weight, its more of my way of thinking. For 10 years I burned an exceptionally large amount of calories a day, every day doing cardio at the gym. My thought was; ""the more calories I burn, the more I can eat."" I finally had to stop the cardio since I had tried to simply cut back but couldn't do since I had become addicted to it. I have since returned and just doing some light lifting and focusing on ab work.I also recently weaned off from a certain prescription medication which had suppressed my appetite, although that was not the reason I was taken it. Now my appetite has come back and I’m fighting my thought patterns and I’m depressed about eating. For most of the last 10 years, I have been preoccupied with being as thin as I could be. Since I stopped the that medication and my appetite returning, I have put on some weight (my wife and daughter thinks I look better since she felt and had others asked her if I was alright, due to my weight. She said some thought I had cancer, of course I didn’t think I was that bad but I know my way of thinking may have been since it cause depression if I gained a few lbs. ) and I’m still depressed and preoccupied over not wanting to gain weight.Also, I use to weigh myself 5 times a day and would document my weight. This was doing my excessive cardio days. Now I do weigh my self once a day. Even one or two lbs one way or another can have an extreme effect on my mood.",_admin_moderator,"Wed,08/29/2018-12:04am",Hello and welcome wanz44.,Hello and welcome wanz44.

438,NotSoSkinnyNinny,08/25/2018,Scared of upping clories after months of restriction as not underweight,"Hi, my family nickname is Ninny so I'll go by that!
To cut to the chase, I have been restricting for about 5 months I think? It started as a 'lifestyle change', (calorie counting, meal planning, clean eating) to lose my excess weight. I used to be around, so I thought I was just dedicated to becoming healthier, that I was in control and would just stop once I was in the middle of a healthy range. I knew my behaviour wasn't normal but thought it was okay because I couldnt be anorexia, I was overweight and actually needed to lose weight. I thought that, in the end, I would be able to up my calories a load and eat banned foods again without any anxiety. But it'll never be the 'end', as I can see now that I really wanted control over something when I could no longer cope.
My behaviour and attitude towards food quickly became what one may call orthorexic. I became scared of eating out or drinking, cut out foods and groups, would scan food labels and plan ahead, only eat 'my' food on my tableware that I cooked myself. I developed fear foods, routines and obsessions then I joined the gym in the last 2 months and combined restriction with overexercising. I lost my period, cold, exhausted, in pain, sleep less, lost interest in hobbies or friends, messed up hunger signals, after-meal tummy aches at times. What you would expect from malnourishing your body.
This is mainly because I still have a lot of fat stores around my tummy and legs.
I would honestly like to lose more weight but I know I can't keep doing this to my body and living in fear of food. I have signed up for therapy to challenge these behaviours and thoughts BUT I always had in mind that I would just incorporate 'banned' foods back into my diet.
As I looked up recovery, I didn't understand how it would apply to me - not being underweight or anorexic. I don't need to gain weight. But it hit me that I do need to repair body damage, and that requires energy and calories.
So a big fear of mine, is that since I have damaged my body and metabolism is that if I raise it to fix my body - that I will gain fat and weight.
My therapy won't be for a while so I don't know what to do, I still want to restrict and exercise but I don't want to make all my effort be for nothing if I'm just sabotaging my weight loss.
I would like to be normal - to eat normally and overcome this and feel good again - but also not have such a disproportion amount of belly fat for my size. Will upping calories make my weight overshoot even if I don't need to gain?",_admin_moderator,"Tue,08/28/2018-11:41pm",Hello and welcome Ninny. Your,Hello and welcome Ninny.

I am writing this post with very mixed feelings. I don’t know what I expect from it so I am just going to leave my words here as they come out. I am 30 years old and I have had an eating disorder for half the time I have lived. It started out with bulimia accompanied with a bunch of other self distructive behavior like cutting as well as depression when I was 14. I was in psychotherapy for about 5 years but never talked about my eating disorder. I have lived a pretty normal life so far if you want to call it that way and it never seemed that I have a really big issue really. I met the love of my life 2 years ago. He’s the first one I have ever talked about my eating disorder. Now I see how big my problem is. He sees it every day and deals with it and supports me in every way he can IF I am willing to get better. And I am. But I am afraid as well. I don’t know how or where to start and how it is going to affect my body. Also I do live on a remote island with no doctors or clinics or whatsoever at the moment so I neet support that is available from a distance.

441,mercedes1974,07/20/2018,Old enough to be your mom...,"I am introducing myself, but also asking for advice.I am 44 years old, and have had some manifestation of an eating disorder since about age 9. At age 9, I was more than xx overweight, and when a doctor told me I was obese, it triggered a Lenten giving up of certain foods that then turned into anorexia. In high school, I was severely bulimic, relying on laxatives to keep my weight in check. This lasted through college, when I began exercising to maintain my weight. I tried OA for many years, and had some semblance of recovery--at least I would eat regular meals and exercise just once a day--but then I got pregnant. During that time, the OA members in my town gave me a hard time. I know they were trying to intervene for good, but they pushed me away (or I pushed myself away). Post pregnancy, I had about a year or two of utter freedom. I was (an am) absolutely in love with my son and my husband has always been very supportive of me. I had a year or two of bliss. But I never went back to OA. I do go to therapy and I am regularly seen by a psych nurse for medication (anxiety and depression). On the surface, there is nothing wrong with me. I have a job that pays very well. I have job security (for the most part). I generally love what I do, but sometimes I feel trapped. I fantasize about having other jobs (again, despite having an enviable position). I live in a great town with great schools. Last year, I had a bout of severe, severe depression. I'm not sure, but I think this in part triggered more anxiety around food for me. I have not lost a lot of weight, but over the last few months I have begun restricting again, avoiding social/food gatherings even more than usual, and I've started exercising in addition to the hour of cardio a day I do. This morning, I considered calling an RD. I have never been honest with my doctor about having any eating disorder. I haven't been completely honest with my therapist and psych nurse about food. I'm terrified of eating more because my weight is normal, but according to my calculations, I should be eating at least xxx more calories. I'm ashamed, too, because, let's face it, I'm 44. I don't feel like there is a lot of support for middle-aged women. And someone who looks like me with my life is a tough sell. I look fine. I don't look like I restrict at all. Yet here I am.Thanks for reading.Mercedes",_admin_moderator,"Tue,07/24/2018-9:29pm","Hi dsprte4hope,   We wanted","Hi dsprte4hope,   We wanted to let you know we edited your post to remove certain numbers and words.

Currently I am seeing a therapist and dietitian once a week at a location that is 40 minutes away (it's the closest option I've got). I've been going for almost two months now and from day one we have all agreed that I need a higher level of care. Things aren't progressing and they have really pushed me again to move up in care. Unfortunately, I just don't know how to do that at this stage in my life. I just started a new full-time job in March and I'm a single mother to a three year old. My family lives 3 hours away. There is an eating disorder treatment center that is also 40 mins away from where I live that my current therapist and dietitian are affiliated with. Obviously that would be my best choice. I've done the intake and they are recommending PHP. I can't take that much time off of work right now. They have an IOP program that I could probably manage my schedule around but I have no idea what I would do with my daughter. Has anyone had to deal with figuring out childcare on top of treatment? She goes to daycare but they close at 6 and IOP ends at 6:30 (plus the drive back home). I can't imagine what it would cost to hire somebody to pick her up and care for her until I got home.

I counted calories everyday and made sure I consumed a specific amount of calories, and if I ever went over that, I would head to the treadmill. Lately, after my high school graduation, I've felt a bit lonely. I have been eating so much (more than ever before, specifically at night) and I don't understand why. I eat when I am not even hungry. I am eating till I feel so badly about myself. I eat by myself when no one is watching. I feel so badly after, and I don't eat all day and then binge again at night. I don't know why. I don't understand why. I don't know if there's something wrong with me. I have gained weight because of this. I think about my weight 24/7.

I try to be open about it with other people but they always say that i don't look like i have anorexia. I know I'm not bigger but i still see myself that way. I weigh myself everyday. Deep down i want my weight to be less than it is. I feel hopeless and stuck. My parents try to force me to eat which makes me not want to eat more. I hate i have to live like this.

My parents and sister don't know that I do this and I had the feeling to binge eat when everyone was gone and I went all around the house and in my room and took all of the food that I was hiding and I threw it in the garbage outside.

459,blondiegirl,07/19/2018,i don't know what to do ,i'm currently in a struggle about reaching out for help. i don't know if i'm overthinking and overreacting or if i should be concerned. i go through stages where i will eat and not think about it and then where i will eat and calorie count and restrict. but i also binge on the weekends and feel guilty and then restrict during the week. i'm in a job where i'm constantly busy and moving around so i typically don't eat lunch and im ok with that. even if i'm hungry since i don't eat breakfast either. for dinner i will usually eat but i try and watch what it is especially depending on what stage i'm in. typically i eat within a specific range of calories per day. people have pointed out how little i eat sometimes but i don't think they meant anything by it and have no idea that i feel like i struggle with food sometimes. i've also been asked lately if i've lost weight but i have because i went from a very sedentary job to an active job and at my sedentary job i did eat lunch most days. i'm tempted to reach out to a coworker but don't want to cause alarm or make a big deal out of nothing or feel like i'm being watched either. has anyone gone through this before? am i just overreacting? i don't starve myself per say but i do have the fear of gaining weight and sometimes eat less than i could or refuse to eat certain foods because of calories/carbs.,_admin_moderator,"Mon,07/23/2018-7:37pm",Edited Post,"Hi ashley_recovery, we removed a portion of your post because it included treatment advice and a personal endorsement for an outside website.

460,haywiz5584,07/20/2018,Not your average bulimic,So I have been in treatment for 4 years now but I really still don't have much control when I was 12 years old I taught myself how to purge since then I continue to purge for years and years and years and still remained overweight at 28 years old I went through an extremely stressful time in my life and began to restrict food I lost a significant amount of weight in about 6 months shortly after that someone said something to me that really hurt my feelings I went to my best friend I told her I needed help and we went to the hospital that is where my treatment started I don't think that anyone at the hospital felt that my problem was as severe as it was because for years later I would say 5 days out of 7 I still Purge I don't eat massive amounts of food I'm actually extremely restrictive but unfortunately when I eat a normal meal or maybe two and a day I feel guilty about it and I struggle so much worrying that I'm going to get heavy again that I get rid of normal amounts of food I'm may be in taking a certain amount of calories a day and have been doing so for at least five years if not more I definitely do have bad days and I do have good days but I feel like recovery should be able to maintain for a week at least and I do not have the control to stop myself from eating what I consider bad foods to where I don't Purge I can literally eat one piece of a food item that’s somewhat unhealthy and I'm okay if I eat a normal serving which would be two small pieces I feel guilty even if it's with just healthy foods which unfortunately I have received is very lacking I don't have any maintenance or coping skills and I'm still being very detrimental to myself and my body and I just don't know how to fix it I do not know how to feel okay with what I am consuming even if it is healthy food and even if my body doesn't need it please tell me please please please tell me there's someone else out there with this problem,_admin_moderator,"Sun,07/22/2018-10:48pm",Post Edited,"Hi haywiz5584, welcome to the forums!

461,Truce38,07-10-18,What now,"Over the last year I became obsessed with fitness and eating healthily. I was a healthy weight until a 6 week holiday on the other side of the world. I really did not want to go and hated being away from home and my whole fitness and eating routine. As a result of the stress I was barely eating,   and  I lost a significant amount of weight. I couldn’t sleep at night, I felt faint all the time and my heart rate slowed to around 40 bpm. Since getting back from the holiday in January I returned to school and got called in to talk with teachers as my friends were worried about how much weight I had lost. I decided to try and recover, stopped exercising for a while and allowing myself to eat normally. After gaining half of the weight back, I started hating the way I looked and decided to start exercising. I also started cutting back on certain foods. Then I started feeling hungry all the time, binging and restricting them for the rest. Over the last month or so the binges have become more frequent, happening a few days in a row and then me not eating certain foods for around 3days before binging again. I am at a healthy weight now, although my period has been gone for a year and hasn’t come back. I don’t think I look fit anymore and I want to lose the weight again but it’s so hard to break this cycle. I promise myself that I will start eating healthy and working out, that lasts for a few days and then I just binge again. I just want to have a healthy relationship with food, without worrying about everything I eat and then binging and then feeling so guilty afterwards. I have no idea how much I should be eating, how often, or what I should be eating along with exercise to look fit and healthy again. I am sixteen.. What should I do to maintain or lose weight without spiraling into obsession and restriction?",_admin_moderator,"Wed,07/11/2018-12:24pm",Truce38! We are glad that you,"Truce38!

462,mich678,07-10-18,My parent telling me to grow up,"I was in the car and she had looked through my fitness pal app where I had been tracking calories. She tells me I'm a child and at 17 years old... she shouldn't have to babysit me to make sure I eat. She yelled at me in the car to grow up and stop being a child. I'm not trying to be a child. This is scary to me! I can add calories like crazy but fail in my math classes. I feel guilty after eating. I walk miles everyday when I rather sleep. I have to do this or I don't feel good about myself. I'm afraid of what is happening to me... am I really a child because of this? she won't listen when i try to tell her, she just goes through a drive through thinking she has solved everything with one trip.

463,rw1234,07-05-18,Reaching Out,"I am new to this site and I am just reaching out until I can get into therapy. I'm not even sure where to begin. I'm not even sure I belong here.I've been unhappy with my body all my life. Everyone thinks I am so small and petite but I don't see or feel it. I go thru periods of restricting and bingeing. In the last month or so, I have been really relaxed and free with my eating. Not counting calories or weighing food. Not being so rigorous with intermittent fasting hours. And eating more of what I want, when I want. Trying to be OK with my body the way it is. The problem is that as soon as I stop with one behavior, I begin another. I feel like I've been doing this for a month, but can't really tell if it's that or just eating normally, since when I was usually hungry and not eating a ton. I've gradually put weight back on too, and I feel disgusted with myself and like I need to start engaging in these behaviors again, but I know that will just lead me back to where I am now. I can't look in a mirror and feel comfortable, even when I am at a weight that is considered to be ""underweight"". I feel guilty today for eating like crap this weekend. I feel really fat and like my clothes don't fit. I cried while getting dressed this morning after changing my outfit and nothing fits the way I want. I'm bloated and just feel gross. And it makes me feel defeated and like all I want to do is go back. I'm obsessed and constantly take photos of myself too see how I look in different outfits and what not and scroll thru them and compare day to day, week to week, and I can't stop. I spend hours doing this. I just want to wake up one day and not have the first thought be about food or how I look. I want to be a normal person who doesn't have to think about what they eat and what effect it might have on them. I feel like I don't how to live normally and don't know where to turn.

464,massshha,07-06-18,binge-eating after anorexia,"hello everyone! ~my name's Mary, I'm currently 15yo.
when i was about 11 yo, i started losing weight, since I've always been a plump child and wanted to finally change something. i discovered healthy food, sports, started losing weight and was extremely happy with my life.
my goal has always been to reach a certain weight and even though i was already thin enough, i wanted to reach my goal weight anyway.
i was sure i'd become happier as soon as i lose enough weight, but for some reason i didn't feel anything when i stepped on a scale and saw a number i was dreaming about. thats where it all went downhill.
i decided i needed to loose more to look better and become happier.
i started eating much less and working out more. i was suddenly extremely scared of so-called unhealthy food and almost had panic attacks if i ate something wrong. my weight was dropping extremely fast, my clothes became baggy, but i wasn't feeling right.
even though my skin was dry, my hands and legs were constantly cold, all my hair was falling out and i was always sad, i still saw a fat girl in the reflection.
thats when i started binging. of course i didn't want to do it, and was always screaming and crying if i overate, but i couldn't cope with it. although i wasn't happy with my weight gain at all, i was looking much less like a skeleton and feeling more energetic.
however, i couldn't stop binging even after i gained needed amount of weight.
its been a year and a half, and now i weight more. i binge almost every day and can't control myself anymore.
I'm scared of going out since I'm sure people are looking at how fat i am and talking about me. my friends and classmates started joking about my weight. i tried puking to loose weight, but i have bad vomiting reflexes and just simply can't do it.
I'm now working with a therapist and have diagnosed depression, eating disorder and social anxiety. neither my family nor my friends understand me and i feel extremely lonely. people are accusing me of faking my depression and just seeking for attention.
i feel like I'm broken and i don't know anyone with same problems in my real life.
I'm feeling suicidal, even though I'm not planning to do anything with myself (I'm actually really scared of pain and thats the only reason), i just don't wanna live anymore. nothing brings me joy, so i just sit in my room watching videos, eating and occasionally going out to the gym (but I'm scared of people there criticizing my body, so sometimes i don't go there even if i want to)i don't know why I'm writing this, honestly. I'm not sure if anything can help me, but I'm trying to take every single opportunity if there is a smallest chance of making me feel better.
