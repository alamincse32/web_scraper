0,10/25/2021,UnsureifIhaveadisorder,"My wife is concerned I have an unhealthy relationship with food because I count calories and macros daily. I do have a bit of body dysmorphia because of a lot of things:
When I was a kid I was very skinny as a wrestler, so that did harbor a negative relationship with food at a young age. College freed me from that and I put on a ton of weight rapidly. Then I lost a lot of weight to get healthier about 4 yes after graduation, which focused mostly on avoiding certain foods and exercising. And I was in a stage performance in 2019 where I lost weight to fit a vision, but I had the understanding that I wouldn't ever do that again once the show ended.
Since then I've just been counting to make sure I eat the right amount of food for my size, and keep things balanced. This to me feels like a more generalized idea of eating. I also exercise several times a week. I'm not skipping meals, though I do tend to skip a snack in the day and then binge later at night.Is this obsessive? Or some type of disorder?","Hi B4TM4N!

But what I would ask myself is to what extent these sorts of things are getting in the way of things from an emotional standpoint.  That would seem to be what defines "" a problem"" to me.
Also, what sort of level of anxiety or self-condemnation might you find yourself feeling if you strayed from whatever routine you have set for yourself ?  I think that's a measure of things as well.
In any case, just some things to think about.",,,
1,10/14/2021,AMIBULIMIC?,"It started last year ,while i was 18 years old.I spent a rough year stressing over exams and at the same period i was really afraid not to gain any weight ,because of the limited time i had to workout .My weight was never a real problem .Nevertheless, i started developing in my head this constant fear of gaining weight.So , i balanced my time between reading and working out daily.I also had a pretty strict diet(cutting out certain food groups),which i maintained for 2 months and lost some weight .People started commenting on my beautiful body so i felt really uplifted .Everything felt great and even though i was extremely pressured ,i managed to balance all that and was feeling really healthy.I feel that the real problem started developing the summer after the exams .After all that pressure ,i could finally let loose of myself.So i stopped watching my diet and gradually till august i had gained all the  weight back.I still felt ok with my weight as i knew that other people couldn't really tell the difference.But i started feeling more dissatisfied with myself than ever before.My clothes would't fit me perfectly and my eating habits had gotten back to normal.I was at 0 .And then...quarantine gave me a hard slap on the face.I couldn't play volleyball anymore,which was my passion since forever.I couldn't go to college , took online courses instead.I couldn't see my friends .It was a big change in my life ,it felt like everything was falling apart.I think i spent months being depressed,arguing with my parents,doing nothing productive with my life .They didn't even allow us celebrate christmas with our loved ones.I could literally see my life passing by...I think that's when i started finding confort in food.All i did was binge eating ,watching series all day and feeling bad about myself.   After those months ,coffee shops and gym were finally open again .My decision was to take advantage of my free time and get out of that cycle.So i started working at a coffe shop ,took driving classes,enrolled to the gym etc.I thought it was all over .I thought that keeping myself busy would make my food problem disapear .Instead i was always exhausted from work and started binging even more.I still couldn't realize i had a problem.I spent the whole summer thinking about my body and my weight.Then summer ended..  The now: Now ,a year later, i finally left town to go to a university.I'm still adapting to the new life:new home,new town ,new people ...As one can imagine im pretty stressed.At first ,i really tried eating healthy and maintaining my weight.But now,i find myself binge eating exta amounts of food uncontrolably.I just can't control myself.I consume food till i can't move from the pain .Then i feel awful and weak ,but i always end up doing it again .Im Often so swollen and embarassed to get out .I cancel my plans and sit home all day hurting.I've tried purging.Today i made it for the first time.It was this moment i realized things are serious and im not just simply walk away from something like this .It sickenes my mind even thinking about it .Im desperate,im afraid,i can't control it ,don't know what's hapening and why ...I just want to stop worrying about my weight .Please help.P.S. I have trichotillomania(since i was little),developed severe dermatillomania in puberty and im pretty sure i have a light form of OCD even though im not diagnosed.I 'm also a perfectionist (took me years to realize).","Welcome to the forums Nikos!

2,09/30/2021,DoIhaveaneatingdisorder?,"Hi guys, this is kinda scary lol.  Anyways I am a 19 year old male, a freshman in college.  I am reaching out because I am scared to talk to people I know in person about this topic.  I have not gone to the doctor about any of my mental health concerns due to fear of my parents overworrying about me which makes me stress out more.  If I say that I have a mental health disorder or imply that I feel like I have it, and I do not but this process offends anybody I sincerely apologize.
I have been struggling with what I feel is anxiety for years now, but it is not to the point where it messes with my functionality so I think i'm fine there.  I started having what i belive to be bipolar episodes in eight grade.  I go through phases where I am extremely depressed, but then something can happen and I will become extremly happy, but I am also more happy than sad so IDK if I qualify as bipolar.  Now with the eating disorder it has been going on since freshman year.  I would change my body to what other people wanted.  During football season I was a lineman and would gain weight to be at my heaviest.  I was 5 foot 5 at the time.  I would do this by stuffing myself full of food.  During baseball season however I would need to lose weight, the lowest I got during baseball was less than my heaviest and I was 5 foot 7.  The way I acheived this was by starving myself for 2-3 days while doing my atheltics.  Then I would gourge myself for a day, feel terrible and start over. I was so proud of the number on the scale, but still hate the way my body looks.  About 3 months ago I stopped starving myself and havent felt like this, but recently I have started hating my body again even though I havent put on any weight and I feel that I am going to fall back into that cycle.","Hi Kga63!

So 2 years ago I am very obese teen, and then I suddenly want to lose weight cause I’m very ashamed of my body and I have a family history of diabetes & high blood pressure so I try to workout and  and loose some weight to be in a healthy range, In 2 years and of course.  I am very happy that I loss that tremendous amount of weight in my age, to be healthier and so I can wear all my fitted clothes. So the next month I come up  a plan for exercising and eating healthy and also the time I bought a scale thats the start of my scale obsession start and also my eating disorder/problem it started when I watch mukbang videos/cooking shows/food vlogs. At first I said i’m gonna eat only certain foods and because I have money I can buy food whatever I want and how much I want to consume I hide a food from my cousin and to mom in my closet go outside when my mom and cousin are busy, then increase how much I eat, which is very high for my age and it very depressing for me and concerning.  I’m suffering from food addiction,binge eating, eating disorders or some case I have Bulimia for almost a month now. I didn’t go to the doctor and I don’t want to tell my mom cause she doesn’t even care whats happening to me and I don’t have money to go to a dietitian. I was very concerned about my health. I tried to put my money on my moms piggy bank so I cannot use it but I always have an idea to get the money back and change my self I always exercise doing a calorie deficit but my diet only become successful at the first day that I tried it and then the next day I binge my self to fullness. I gained back some weight and also my clothes are starting to shrink I am so very depressed how can I change my life again. I don’t know how long this can last.

6,04/10/2021,Ineedtovent,"TW: Addiction (specifically stimulants)Hi, I need to vent on here because friends aren't forever and family has a loud mouth.I'm an 18yr male and just made it half way thru my first year of college (ironically psychology major). As a kid I was always known as the ""skinny kid"" since most of the cousins my age were heavier than me. Then around the age of 9, after the best cruise to the Bahamas with the grandparents, I came back a more fitting member of my cousins. Everyone made comments, some were mean, but my mom's left scars. It felt like I fell off a ladder I didn't even know I was standing on. I didn't do much about it, I hated my body, but I guess not enough until my freshman year of high school when I started using my prescribed medication (with some lovely side affects) to erase some history. Though, I never consistently took them until about 6 months ago. Ever since then I've depended on stimulants to maintain my grades and body (as a college students that's basically my entire life) and I've lost a noticeable amount. I'm starting to think it's less about my weight and more about the feeling of stimulants on an empty stomach, but beginning to feel satisfied with my body is another awesome high I've never felt. I've also started being more active and taking other stuff whenever I reopen those scars. I realize the consequences of my past decisions and the ones I'm making now. I'm not ready to open that door until I am happy with my body (gotta have something nice to sleep on). I feel like I've been preparing for the worst since that horrible cruise.Sad thing is I always though I'd settle with my body being ""average"", but there's always a step higher on the ladder.But I hate to end on a bad note so now I'm going to go watch my favorite show.","Yep, there's being thin…and the process of becoming thin.People can be happy about the former, but become addicted to the latter, and that can be where the trouble begins.

7,05/10/2021,"Maleteenthatbingeeats,butcannotgainweight","To start I am 18, a considerably moderate/healthy weight, lets just say i have a long way before my thigh gap closes.I hate that I over eat, I don't count my food, but I have enough knowledge to know that I'm eating way beyond healthy portions. I typically don't start eating till about 12, but have recently been eating breakfast at school cause I've even started to get hungry then. When I do eat I bring food to go along with school lunch or whatever I've made for the day, (school lunch typically has smaller nutritional values of everything you need to make up for what some kids may not be getting at home)After that I eat a snack.Then for dinner we typically have protein heavy meals, but there are always carb and veggie options. I usually eat about 4 servings of everything at dinner. (like right now I just had a meal, started with a small plate and waited for everyone to eat, then went back for more)At about 1 AM I eat whatever I can find.I eat all this during the week, the weekends are similar but my meal times are much more unplanned and also more of what my body considers a ""snack""I currently do not do much for physical activity, I am in band, I play mallet percussion, and I sleep about 12 hours a day. I honestly have no clue why I cannot gain weight, or why I even eat like this, it's gotten to a point where I'm scared to stop because I may lose weight, or I could develop things like diabetes or other diseases from changing my diet to something my body isn't used to.","Dear idkman, we would like to inform you that we edited your post to remove mentions of height and weight numbers, as welll as mentions of specific food items, since it could be triggering to other users.

8,05/16/2020,NotEating/LosingWeight,"Hi, my name is Patrick and I am 36 years old. I am reaching out bc I am losing weight regularly and not eating well. I haven’t ate well in about two months. I was losing weight during the winter and my doctor did tests on me. They all came back fine and well. I was healthy. Since March, I have not ate well at all. I consume little during the day and at nighttime and that’s bad. I lose a few pounds a week estimated. I fear swallowing and eating due to an episode back in March when i did choke on some food. I fear if I when I eat now I’ll choke, have heartburn, be bloated, or excessively burp. All of these symptoms are true to a degree. My doctor doesn’t seem to want to help me after a few months ago. My family is unsure how to help me thru this crisis of mine. I’m unsure what to do next. I did reach out to a counselor for help that’s a start. I should call my doctor back but what to say something but what. They will be horrified of how I look. My family is horrified of my appearance as well. My weight loss is the cause. I’m at a crossroads. I care about my health and want to get better. I’m unemployed for the past few months as well. Life has been a challenge a well. It seems to be better to be stuck in old ways and not care. Feel free to message me back with any thoughts or feedback would be appreciated. Thanks, Patrick","Hi yorkhaven36.

A person can find themselves being fearful that the same thing might happen again if they eat. If there are other things happening in your life right now that cause you to be anxious, those anxieties might attach themselves to you fear of choking as well.  Maybe you know how that can be - we worry that bad things might happen to us, and when we look around, sometimes we see that it's true!  Look at how thin you have become, and how difficult it is to eat!  So the thing that we want to avoid to try to stay safe (eating) ends up causing outcomes that only increase our anxiety instead.   Kind of like a snake eating it's own tail, if you know what I mean ?Sometimes our worries can go around in circles like that.

I wanted the doctor to help me but they say I am healthy. Now I am afraid of gaining back the weight it is battle.,
9,07/08/2020,Ican’tstopeating,"So I’ve always been bigger than I should be but in the last 10 years I’ve gained a significant amount I fascinate about food, I drive past a shop and think “they sell that” then I go and buy it all and eat it all. For example I could easily got to Morrison’s and buy way too much. Then eat it all in the car on the way home and then come home and eat something else. yesterday I did the above and then for lunch a really large meal, followed by a large dinner. I litteraley never feel full and never feel hungry. a few years ago I was lucky and got onto afitness programme the local authority was running which was 12 weeks of boot camps X times per week and lost some weight really enjoyed life. (I was lucky enough to do the programme twice) but then politics got in the way and I didn’t feel welcome there. move tried joining gyms but I got X or X times. I always feel embarrassed. I got into running and ran a few ks but then I hurt my shoulder and I can’t get back going, I always feel embarrassed the minute I see someone else walking. ive been to the GP many times over the years and told them I feel like an alcoholic would but with food, I was referred to a lifestyle programme but it’s one where after a few weeks they don’t want to be seeing you every week. I went back to the GP and was givenn medication but that didn’t work either. I’ve also taken medication on and off over the years with no joy. I joined a different programme for X months and put on weight I paid to go private and see a physiatrist but after 3 appointments all he was getting me to do was fill in food diaries so I didn’t go back. I really don’t know what else to do, I feel like I’ll never beat this and no one will ever understand my problem or be able to help me. I have a young daughter and I’m embarrassed to be out with her, I go on any rides at theme parks with her and it’s horrible. I feel shame, I know I need to do something but I just can’t motivate myself to do anything.

To feel out of control of our life, and like there's nothing that we can do about it.  Plus the shame part too - That can't help matters either.So have you ever gotten hooked up with some binge eating groups ?  I'm sure that they must have some online.Just being able to talk with other people who are in the same boat, and not having to be alone with it…that could help make a difference I think ?","This has been a lifelong battle with food for you. In a way, you might be gaining comfort from your eating and maybe that all the foods you are eating coulbe be classed as 'comfort foods'. People comfort eat when they are stressed, depressed, hurt, embarrassed, ashamed, feeling guilty and the list could go on.... Much of your eating may occur in private – hence going to the shop, eating it all in the car and then going home to eat again. There is that secret element to this satisfying indulgence that will encourage within you a certain enjoyment. The question for you now is....How can you lose the weight, maintain that weight, increase your fitness and overcome your eating behaviours? There are many books, medications, therapies, treatments, fitness programmes....This list can go on. You successfully completed two 'boot camps'. However. What happens after that initial X weeks of intense diet and training? Then you might injure yourself running. As often happens, when an injury strikes it quickly puts a stop on the activity. You may benefit from different aveunues..... Consultation with an advisor. Fitness routine. Self help. Some psychological support. You could seek some dietary advice. You could benefit from a change in how you think and feel about yourself. Your struggles with you weight are not just about the physical side of things – but the mental state of mind as well. OK. When we embark on a diet and fitness campaign, we have these amazing expectations of ourselves. Feelings of guilt and shame can be associated with food and play a major part in the causes of our eating habits - especially any form of eating disorder. Some counselling may help you to explore your feelings of guilt and shame and may also help you to address the personal causes for your eating issues. Much of this can stem from life experiences. Changing how you think and feel about yourself may enable you to overcome those feelings of embarrassment and could be discussed in counselling. There are also books available on the subject of self-confidence. Having the motivation does take time and will power Admittedly. It's not easy, especially when you are trying to juggle it with your other life commitments. You'll learn that these changes may only at times be subtle, but can make a huge difference. What's more important is how you feel and value yourself - whatever the weight.","Hi PaulShipmanSmith, thanks for posting!

10,07/10/2018,BingeEatingRecovery,"Sup, everyone. This'll be my first post.So I've been struggling with binge eating since 2012 now, and decided to do something about it in 2017. It's never shown physically because I like to keep fit.I went and got therapy and have been actioning the steps. They've worked for the most part, but it's so hard. Sometimes I won't even use them because the urge is so hard to get rid of. It's overwhelming. I have goals in life and fitness but in that moment, then and there, nothing else matters. I just want to be filled with food. In the following days, my productivity is at an all time low.I'm trying so hard with the dealing with the urges, but they accumulate (e.g. I'll deal with them one day, then they'll come back stronger the next). I want to get out of this. I'm scared to let people outside my family/past therapists know, and I don't go out drinking with my friends because I'm terrified of gaining weight through excess calories. I've no idea what to do anymore. I just want to stop doing it. Bit deep, but that's the truth, lol.","I’m a very fit and strong guy and I eat fairly healthy, but when it comes time to eat with my family I splurge. In my case, I found it easier to not overeat by drinks tons of water. I’m still sturggling with binge eating so I can’t give you a good solution lmao. I hope you the best.","I would never recommend this for most people, but yes - drinking does help. It's a 'better than' sort of scenario in my case - better to drink plenty of tea than to lose control over my diabetes by binging.First, though, you have to make the steps. Even baby steps help. The longer you go without binging, the less likely it is that you'll continue. Have you got any areas you'd like to work on?","Hey Constantvigilance. Firstly––I love your username. It's a good way to describe the mindset one must have when overcoming these sorts of challenges.  I am also a pretty active guy who enjoys the competition fo sport, and too, someone who caves now and then and binges. I don't like when these episodes happen because they mess with my energy and concentration levels. I totally get the feeling of ""want to just be filled with food"". In my experience, when I start to have these thoughts I ask myself, ""am I overdoing it on the fitness? Am I fueling my body enough to keep up with my active life? Am I setting aside time to let me body and mind rest?"" I'm still learning to accept this funny fact that the body and the mind are wound up in a crazy web of connection, and that they communicate with each other. As an athlete, I was taught by a few of my coaches to ignore the symptoms of the body, that, ""if you're sore/tired/exhausted-beyond-belief you're doing it 'right"" and that ""the point of sport is to master your mind and learn to control your thoughts.""  What ended up happening to me is that I would ignore my boy's symptoms (soreness, fatigue, sickenss) and keep pushing forward because that's what I believed to be 'right' way to manage training. But my mind caught up eventually, and I began to overeat. I would get so frustrated with myself because I thought it was my ""weak"" mind that was giving up. So I up'd the intensity and continued on with training. But again, I would binge, and I would pity my lack of discipline. What I was missing was the unavoidable fact that I wasn't listening to my body's needs, which is still something that I struggle with to this day. I'd look at my other teammates and see them train just as hard as me, and not experience any struggles with binging (as far as I knew) and I would think low of myself. But instead what I should have done was just accepted the fact that my body has different needs than my teammates and that I need to respect them. I don't 'have' and body, I 'am' a body––which means I have to think of my self (mind, ego) and my body as one unit that is connected (like I said earlier). Now,
when it comes to escaping the black hole of a binge episode, there are tricks that have worked for me in the past in certain moments but have also failed me in others which is why I recommend you make a list of multiple things that help ease your mind and your body!
On the top of my list is talking. I'll pick up the phone and call a friend. Being social helps me reduce my anxiety. I don't normally tell my friend the battle that I'm fighting on my end because I'd rather talk about something else to get my mind off the matter. I try and call my funniest friend because laughing is the best medicine.  If no one is free to chat, I love to write. It helps me to remove myself from my apartment if an urge is particularly bad, so I'll literally grab my notebook and pen and sit in the main lobby of my apartment building and write. Going for a walk is another one that I like, but I tend to do it less frequently. Lastly, plugging in my headphones and lying down with my favorite songs/playlists is so strangely calming. I've even made a playlist that helps me fight the urges to run to the cabinets. I pick songs that remind me of my friends and family. I pick songs with lyrics that remind me of why being my best and healthiest self matters and that we are never alone in this struggle. These are a few things that have worked for me, but I recommend you come up with your own list! It isn't a perfect list, because sometimes the urge just gets so insane and I succumb. Its embarrassing sure, but I'm reminded of my humanity, and I try my best to wake up the next morning with the intention of just being better than yesterday (which sounds cheesy, but once you think about it, it makes so much sense). I hope these words help man!Adagio","Hi. I am just confused about the binge eating effect on your life. I've seen many people discussing about binge eating. But is that related to obesity, or psychological disorders ?","If you have medical questions regarding eating disorders please reach out to our NEDA Helpline at 800.931.2237 M-Th 11am-9pm ET and F 11am-5pm ET or chat with us online M-Th 9am-9pm ET and F 9am-5pm ET.

11,06/16/2020,Readytomovepastthis,"Hello I've been working on this problem for a while now. It has been over 3 years with bulimia on and off. Absolutely no-one knows about this situation of mine. I havent experienced any major problems because of this, but am exited to move past this. I am 18 years old and I am gay. I know this is not treatment, but am looking forward to talk to people on similar circumstances and hear advice and how you are dealing with it. I have a therapist and even having a deep trust in her I do not want to tell her about this since I dont feel comfortable with sharing any of this with her, since I am very concearned about not being able to go back to the US and continue college if I tell her. I really want support and advice on how to procede since going back to college if really important to me, and I would do everything possible for me to return. I know my parents will support me in every step of the way, but i'd rather not tell them for now. I think my bulimia is not that bad, since I could go from one to three weeks without purging  without purging, but it also comes in waves I could be fine for one or two months until it stikes again.","So what do you think the situation is, or the concerns are, that triggers you to purge?  ""I don't want to get fat"" is what a lot of people would say, but I mean emotionally deeper than that.  Like what would ""fat"" symbolize to you ?Some people might say ""It would mean that I'm not in control of my life.""Which is a different concern than ""fat"", if you follow what I mean ?",,,,
12,07/11/2019,TreatmentOptionsforLong-TermED?,"Hello all, This is my first post in this (or any) eating disorders-related forum or group. I'm a 29-year-old male (former competitive distance runner) who has struggled with a variety of eating disorders for close to the last decade. For me, disordered eating started with extreme caloric restriction for the first few years, followed by years of back and forth between binge eating and periods of restriction. At the present time, I'm dealing with what I know is a very unhealthy behavior pattern. As you might expect, those patters involve semi-frequent overexertion and injury. I've also developed an all-or-nothing mindset where I either am able to track everything I eat and hit my nutrition goals perfectly OR have very large binges. More often than not, I find myself ""staying on track"" during the workweek, then bingeing during the evenings of each weekend, often surpassing X calories on days of binges. Intellectually, I know I'm doing short and long term damage to my mind and body (which, at moments, is utterly terrifying), but I find myself cycling through periods of motivation and utter hopelessness and am at the point where I know I need outside help (in some way) to begin on the pathway toward some kind of recovery. Does anyone have thoughts or recommendations about where and how to start? My spouse has some idea of my challenges with food, but I've largely played down the fact that this is still a prominent issue in my life. Additionally, I'm not sure if I should consider some kind of out- or in-patient treatment, possible medications, or therapy. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.Thanks!todded","Hello! Welcome to the NEDA forums! We would like to let you know that we edited your post to remove detailed descriptions of disordered eating behaviors, as well as calorie numbers, which are not allowed on the forums. You can review our community guidelines here. Thanks for your understanding and please continue posting! ","Im sorry you feel this way, I feel similarly- even the restrict/binge... I just kept saying to my different providers there might be an issue and now I'm starting treatment. I know i have more than other people may but if you don't go to any therapy maybe consider starting SOMETHING at least to talk to SOMEONE about this even if you can't find an ED place at first. I couldn't starting, the closest IOP is 1.5 hrs away but if you're ready enough you'll be able to get somewhere i hope",Nevermind,"Let me start by saying that I am kind of angry. With regard to Men with eating disorders, NEDA states all the obvious observations that I've seen stated for the last 12+ years. I.e... men with Ed's are ""under-represented"". Blah, blah... ""stigmas"". So why are we still at a stand-still on the topic. If anyone really cared about men with eating disorders, I would have expected to see advancements on the narrative by now. Instead, just more of the same repeated statements like the ones on this sight.
Add to that, at first glance (after an hour spent on the site) I do not see any information  or insights on the topic of eating disorders in the senior community. Sure there are upfront  statement about how Ed's cross socio-economic lines; gender lines; ethnicity  lines, but no mention of age lines. This exclusion of an affected demographic makes me so sad and disheartened.
I am a 57 year old male who has struggled with Anorexia for the past 14 years.
In terms of NEDA, I don't  even exist.","I have to say, this is so remarkably similar to what I have experienced myself, including the downplaying to my girlfriend. I truly do believe the first step is telling them, and seeking professional help. Getting said professional help allows you to identify the patterns which are harmful and need to be stopped, while having loved ones be aware of your struggles can help you kick those habits/behaviours. I have only been recovering for a few months really, but those are what I found were key. I wish nothing but the best for you."
13,03/12/2020,SomehowLostAnImportantPhysiologicalFunction,"I have to say the least, a very unique situation. At some point along the line in my life, I've lost the ability to normally perceive hunger. Or maybe I've never had it to begin with, I cannot decide. A little bit of context may indicate some kind of answer to this: I have a physical disability known as Spina Bifida, of which spinal cord damages it has caused has lost some nerve functioning in the course of many incidents over the years. I've yet to act on this suspicion, if I even need to. I know fully well that this isn't normal, yet I don't see this to be a problem. Sure, I don't eat many snacks, and if left unattended I am at high risk of accidentally missing a meal(or two). However, it isn't like I don't feel the side effects of hunger;Usually when I am ""hungry"" and food is presented in front of me, I can gauge my hunger level by level of interest in food. Also, if I go without food long enough, I start to feel weak/faint and low energy. But, these are quite inconvenient and unconventional measures for hunger, and I am having second thoughts about themSo what do you all think? Is this as bad as part of me thinks it is? Any other thoughts?","Here's how I see things like this.   If they are getting in the way of your daily life, or are causing you to not function as well as you could, then that qualifies things as ""a problem"". When I was a very small child, I just didn't eat.  I didn't enjoy eating, and it seemed like a nuisance to me.  My mom took me to the doctor, but I was healthy, so he told her not to worry.  This went on for me well into adulthood, and I remained painfully thin.  I was still quite active though, so it never seemed like a big deal.   However there were repeated times when I would go out in my canoe for fishing, and I'd stay out for a pretty long time, and I'd notice how weak and addle-headed I would get.Golly, maybe it would help if I packed a lunch ?  So I tried that and what do you know - I was much more able to keep my wits about me.at the end of the day.   When I was doing extended physical activities , it turned out to be the same thing.   If I'd eat, I had more stamina and could do a lot better.So yeah, there are practical things about eating that can make life better I think. This is assuming that there's not some big psychological issue attached to eating of course,  which is something that you didn't mention ?","You're reply is reassuring - I am not the only who has dealt with this issue.I would second all of what you have said about the effects - I tend to get weak and listless when I don't eat. I just have been spooked since people around me can talk about food they feel like eating, and I don't exhibit same level of interest that everyone I've met has in food.I don't have any psychological problem with eating as far as I can tell. Food is just sustenance for me unless it is food I like. But even in the case of food I really love, I don't think about it unless it follows along with my daily 3-meals-a-day need, rarely is it out of strong personal desire. I never get ""hunger pangs"" or get even close to yearning for any food. I may suffer a lack of interest as time, but I am not perpetually/consistently adverse to food.In conclusion, this seems to be more abnormal but not a problem - it doesn't necessarily ""get in the way"" of my day-to-day life. It is no longer a cause for concern. Thank you for your insights, they were helpful.",,,
14,05/22/2019,Lowlibido,"After I started my recovery I thought that the sex drive/libido/drive to do any even non sex related remained at zero even though I'm almost 9 months into recovery so I decided to go to a doctor(endocrinologist) to get some blood work done t-levels thyroid ext and all tests came back fine Wich makes sense because I live a pretty healthy lifestyle now (eat healthy, get exercise, ext) but I was confused why I still have this issue of low libido so I tried changing around my diet (trying to get all the vitamins and minerals I need and getting enough calories) but nothing seemed to work so I don't know Wich direction to go now to get help for this issue","Boy, I don't know, but I'm glad you got tested at least.What do you think - might it be psychological issue ?Sexual matters often involve a lot of psychological things.",Nevermind,,,
